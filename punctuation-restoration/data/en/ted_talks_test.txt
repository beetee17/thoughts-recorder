you	OO

the	OU

the	OU
key	OO
is	OO
that	OO
the	OO

at	OO
the	OO
back	OO
of	OO
the	OO
line	OO
who	OO

everyone	OO

can	OO
use	OO
the	OO

to	OO

some	OO

so	OU
what	OO

those	OO

that	OO

it	OU

the	OO

there	OU

more	OO
than	OO

what	OO

is	OO
that	OO

that	OO
is	OO
whether	OO
it's	OO
odd	OO
or	OO
even	.O
so	OU
the	OO
solution	OO
is	OO
to	OO
agree	OO
that	OO
whoever	OO
goes	OO
first	OO
will	,O
for	OO
example	,O
say	OO
black	OO
if	OO
he	OO
sees	OO
an	OO
odd	OO

and	OO
white	OO
if	OO
he	OO
sees	OO
an	OO

let's	OU

how	OO
it	OO
would	OO
play	OO
out	OO
if	OO
the	OO
hats	OO
were	OO
distributed	OO
like	OO
this	.O
the	OU
tallest	OO
captive	OO
sees	OO
three	OO
black	OO
hats	OO
in	OO

of	OO
him	,O
so	OO
he	OO
says	OO
black	,O
telling	OO
everyone	OO
else	OO
he	OO
sees	OO
an	OO
odd	OO
number	OO
of	OO
black	OO
hats	.O
he	OU
gets	OO
his	OO
own	OO
hat	OO
color	OO
wrong	,O
but	OO
that's	OO
okay	OO
since	OO
you're	OO
collectively	OO
allowed	OO
to	OO
have	OO
one	OO
wrong	OO
answer	.O
prisoner	OU
two	OO
also	OO
sees	OO
an	OO
odd	OO
number	OO
of	OO
black	OO

so	OO
she	OO
knows	OO

and	OO
answers	OO
correctly	.O
prisoner	OU
three	OO
sees	OO
an	OO
even	OO
number	OO
of	OO

so	OO
he	OO

that	OO
his	OO
must	OO
be	OO
one	OO
of	OO
the	OO
black	OO
hats	OO
the	OO
first	OO

prisoner	OU

that	OO

looking	OO
for	OO
an	OO
even	OO

of	OO
black	OO
hats	OO
since	OO
one	OO
was	OO
behind	OO
her	.O
but	OU
she	OO
only	OO
sees	OO
one	,O
so	OO
she	OO
deduces	OO
that	OO
her	OO
hat	OO
is	OO
also	OO
black	.O
prisoners	OU
five	OO
through	OO
nine	OO

each	OO
looking	OO
for	OO
an	OO
odd	OO
number	OO
of	OO
black	OO

which	OO
they	OO
see	,O
so	OO
they	OO
figure	OO
out	OO
that	OO
their	OO
hats	OO
are	OO
white	.O
now	OU
it	OO
all	OO
comes	OO
down	OO
to	OO
you	OO
at	OO
the	OO

of	OO
the	OO
line	.O
if	OU
the	OO
ninth	OO

saw	OO
an	OO
odd	OO
number	OO
of	OO
black	OO
hats	,O
that	OO
can	OO
only	OO
mean	OO
one	OO
thing	.O
you'll	OU
find	OO
that	OO
this	OO
strategy	OO
works	OO
for	OO
any	OO
possible	OO
arrangement	OO
of	OO
the	OO
hats	.O
the	OU
first	OO
prisoner	OO
has	OO
a	OO
50%	OO
chance	OO
of	OO
giving	OO
a	OO
wrong	OO
answer	OO
about	OO
his	OO
own	OO
hat	,O
but	OO
the	OO
parity	OO
information	OO
he	OO
conveys	OO
allows	OO
everyone	OO
else	OO
to	OO
guess	OO
theirs	OO
with	OO
absolute	OO
certainty	.O
each	OU
begins	OO
by	OO
expecting	OO
to	OO
see	OO
an	OO
odd	OO
or	OO
even	OO
number	OO
of	OO
hats	OO
of	OO
the	OO
specified	OO
color	.O
if	OU
what	OO
they	OO
count	OO
doesn't	OO
match	,O
that	OO
means	OO
their	OO
own	OO

is	OO
that	OO
color	.O
and	OU
everytime	OO
this	OO
happens	,O
the	OO
next	OO

switch	OO
the	OO

that's	OO
it	,O
you're	OO

what	OU
about	OO

in	OU
the	OO
17th	OO

robert	OU

came	OO
up	OO
with	OO
an	OO
idea	OO
for	OO
a	OO
self	OO
watering	OO

he	OU
theorized	OO
that	OO
capillary	OO
action	,O
the	OO
attraction	OO
between	OO

that	OO
pulls	OO
water	OO
through	OO

might	OO
keep	OO
the	OO
water	OO
cycling	OO
around	OO
the	OO
bowl	.O
but	OU
if	OO
the	OO
capillary	OO
action	OO
is	OO
strong	OO
enough	OO
to	OO
overcome	OO
gravity	OO
and	OO
draw	OO
the	OO
water	OO
up	,O
it	OO
would	OO
also	OO
prevent	OO
it	OO
from	OO
falling	OO
back	OO
into	OO
the	OO
bowl	.O
then	OU
there	OO
are	OO
versions	OO
with	OO
magnets	,O
like	OO
this	OO
set	OO
of	OO
ramps	.O
the	OU
ball	OO
is	OO
supposed	OO
to	OO
be	OO
pulled	OO
upwards	OO

the	OO

fall	OO
back	OO
down	OO

repeat	OO
the	OO
cycle	.O
this	OU
one	OO
fails	OO
because	OO
like	OO
the	OO

watering	OO
pot	,O
the	OO

would	OO
simply	OO
hold	OO
the	OO

even	OU
if	OO
it	OO
somehow	OO

the	OO

degrade	OO
over	OO

for	OU
each	OO
of	OO
these	OO
machines	OO
to	OO

they'd	OO
have	OO
to	OO
create	OO
some	OO

to	OO

the	OO

of	OO

there	OU
are	OO
ones	OO
that	OO
seem	OO
to	OO
keep	OO
going	,O
but	OO
in	OO
reality	,O
they	OO
invariably	OO
turn	OO
out	OO
to	OO
be	OO
drawing	OO
energy	OO
from	OO
some	OO
external	OO

even	OU
if	OO

could	OO
somehow	OO
design	OO
a	OO
machine	OO
that	OO
didn't	OO
violate	OO
the	OO
first	OO
law	OO
of	OO

it	OO
still	OO
wouldn't	OO
work	OO
in	OO
the	OO
real	OO

because	OO
of	OO
the	OO

the	OU
second	OO
law	OO
of	OO
thermodynamics	OO
tells	OO
us	OO
that	OO
energy	OO
tends	OO
to	OO
spread	OO
out	OO
through	OO
processes	OO
like	OO

any	OU
real	OO
machine	OO
would	OO
have	OO
moving	OO
parts	OO
or	OO
interactions	OO
with	OO
air	OO
or	OO

that	OO
would	OO
generate	OO
tiny	OO

of	OO

heat	,O
even	OO
in	OO
a	OO

that	OU
heat	OO
is	OO

and	OO
it	OO
would	OO
keep	OO

out	,O
reducing	OO
the	OO

the	OO

these	OO

because	OO

we'll	OO

what	OU

the	OO

here's	OU
how	OO

a	OO

the	OO

use	OO

to	OO
carve	OO
a	OO

in	OO

allowing	OO

that	OO
we	OO

—	OO
from	OO

to	OO

to	OO

but	OU
it's	OO
not	OO
just	OO
that	OO
mosquitos	OO
are	OO
annoying	,O
they're	OO
also	OO
deadly	.O
mosquitos	OU
can	OO

it's	OO

the	OO

removes	OO

if	OU
we	OO

how	OU

to	OO

that	OO
a	OO

how	OO

we	OO

for	OU

100	OO

sir	OU

rutherford	,U
a	OO
very	OO
famous	OO

'all	OO

by	OU
which	OO
he	OO
meant	OO
that	OO
if	OO
you	OO

make	OO
it	OO
into	OO

or	OO
physics	,O
it	OO
doesn't	OO

that	OU

then	OO
the	OO
natural	OO

and	OO
a	OO

of	OO

and	OU
i	OU
think	OO
at	OO
the	OO
far	OO
end	OO
of	OO
the	OO
spectrum	OO
would	OO
be	OO
my	OO
subject	,O
palaeontology	.O
i'd	OU
like	OO
to	OO
give	OO
you	OO
an	OO
example	OO
though	,O
to	OO
show	OO
you	OO
how	OO
we	OO
apply	OO
scientific	OO
methods	OO
to	OO
achieve	OO
a	OO
certain	OO
level	OO
of	OO
understanding	OO
and	OO
certainty	.O
and	OU
this	OO
is	OO
something	OO
that	OO
has	OO
been	OO
developing	OO
during	OO
my	OO
career	OO
so	OO
that	OO
when	OO
i	OU
started	,O
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
what	OO
we	OO
did	OO
would	OO
be	OO
called	OO
a	OO
speculation	OO
or	OO
guesswork	,O
whereas	OO
now	,O
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
what	OO
we	OO
do	OO
can	OO
be	OO
tested	OO
and	OO
can	OO
be	OO
called	OO
scientific	.O
the	OU
example	OO
i'm	OU
going	OO
to	OO
take	OO
is	OO
the	OO
question	OO
i	OU
asked	OO
when	OO
i	OU
was	OO
seven	,O
'could	OO
t	.U
rex	OO
bite	OO
a	OO
car	OO
in	OO
half?'	OO
this	OU
is	OO
a	OO
question	OO
about	OO
the	OO
most	OO
famous	OO
dinosaur	,O
tyrannosaurus	OU
rex	,U
which	OO
was	OO
huge	,O
five	OO
tons	OO
in	OO
weight	,O
enormous	OO
jaws	OO
and	OO
teeth	.O
could	OU
it	OO
bite	OO
a	OO
car	OO
in	OO
half	?O
well	,U
there	OO
were	OO
no	OO
cars	OO
in	OO
the	OO
cretaceous	,U
but	OO
let's	OO
forget	OO
that	OO
for	OO
the	OO
moment	.O
when	OU
i	OU
started	,O
you	OO
could	OO
only	OO
answer	OO
that	OO
question	OO
by	OO
guesswork	,O
or	OO
you	OO
could	OO
make	OO
some	OO
very	OO
simple	OO
models	OO
of	OO
the	OO
skull	,O
like	OO
levers	,O
and	OO
try	OO
to	OO
calculate	OO
things	.O
if	OU
you	OO
were	OO
going	OO
to	OO
make	OO
a	OO
realistic	OO
model	OO
that	OO
had	OO
all	OO
the	OO
properties	OO
of	OO
the	OO
original	OO
bone	OO
and	OO
flesh	OO
of	OO
the	OO
dinosaur	,O
you	OO
could	OO
not	OO
do	OO
it	.O
but	OU
now	,O
with	OO
the	OO
power	OO
of	OO
computing	,O
we	OO
can	OO
do	OO
this	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
thing	.O
so	OU
the	OO
way	OO
you	OO
calculate	OO
the	OO
bite	OO
force	OO
of	OO
t	.U
rex	,O
and	OO
the	OO
way	OO
people	OO
have	OO
done	OO
it	,O
is	OO
they	OO
scan	OO
a	OO
skull	OO
and	OO
make	OO
a	OO
three	OO
dimensional	,O
digital	OO
model	OO
inside	OO
the	OO
computer	.O
you	OU
then	OO
divide	OO
that	OO
model	OO
into	OO
a	OO
mesh	,O
or	OO
into	OO
a	OO
framework	OO
of	OO
elements	OO
or	OO
small	OO
components	.O
and	OU
each	OO
of	OO
these	OO
elements	OO
can	OO
be	OO
given	OO
physical	OO
properties	OO
so	OO
that	OO
we	OO
know	OO
the	OO
physical	OO
properties	OO
of	OO
bone	OO
of	OO
living	OO
animals	.O
these	OU
are	OO
material	OO
properties	,O
like	OO
how	OO
far	OO
can	OO
you	OO
twist	OO
the	OO
bone	OO
before	OO
it	OO
breaks	,O
how	OO
much	OO
compression	OO
can	OO
that	OO
bone	OO
take	.O
and	OU
so	OO
all	OO
of	OO
those	OO
properties	OO
are	OO
mapped	OO
into	OO
the	OO
skull	.O
and	OU
then	OO
you	OO
apply	OO
imaginary	OO
forces	OO
and	OO
increase	OO
those	OO
pressures	OO
until	OO
the	OO
thing	OO
breaks	.O
and	OU
so	OO
the	OO
bite	OO
force	OO
of	OO
t	.U
rex	OO
is	OO
huge	.O
let	OU
me	OO
lead	OO
you	OO
to	OO
the	OO
figure	.O
our	OU
bite	OO
force	OO
is	OO
about	OO
800	OO
newtons	OO
at	OO
most	.O
the	OU
biggest	OO
bite	OO
force	OO
of	OO
any	OO
living	OO
animal	OO
is	OO
the	OO
great	OO
white	OO
shark	,O
and	OO
that	OO
is	OO
about	OO
5,000	OO
newtons	.O
t	.U
rex	,O
50,000	OO
newtons	,O
ten	OO
times	.O
and	OU
that's	OO
equivalent	OO
to	OO
five	OO
tons	OO
of	OO
weight	,O
acting	.O
so	OU
it	OO
could	OO
bite	OO
a	OO
car	OO
in	OO
half	.O
why	OU
do	OO
we	OO
believe	OO
this	OO
method	?O
because	OU
this	OO
method	OO
is	OO
a	OO
standard	OO
in	OO
design	OO
and	OO
architecture	.O
finite	OU
element	OO
analysis	OO
is	OO
used	OO
for	OO
designing	OO
buildings	OO
like	OO
this	OO
one	.O
you	OU
don't	OO
simply	OO
build	OO
it	OO
and	OO
hope	OO
it	OO
doesn't	OO
fall	OO
down	.O
the	OU
thing	OO
is	OO
designed	OO
in	OO
a	OO
computer	,O
it	OO
is	OO
stress	OO
tested	OO
using	OO
this	OO
program	OO
we	OO
apply	OO
to	OO
the	OO
dinosaur	.O
i	OU
think	OO
we	OO
can	OO
believe	OO
it	.O
but	OU
let's	OO
move	OO
on	.O
that	OU
was	OO
just	OO
a	OO
brief	OO
word	OO
about	OO
how	OO
you	OO
can	OO
actually	OO
apply	OO
science	,O
i	OU
would	OO
argue	,O
to	OO
questions	OO
that	OO
are	OO
not	OO
happening	OO
at	OO
our	OO
time	,O
in	OO
the	OO
past	,O
or	OO
maybe	OO
in	OO
the	OO
future	.O
and	OU
in	OO
palaeontology	,O
we	OO
don't	OO
just	OO
find	OO
fossils	.O
we	OU
also	OO
care	OO
about	OO
evolution	OO
and	OO
diversification	,O
how	OO
groups	OO
have	OO
become	OO
diverse	,O
how	OO
groups	OO
go	OO
extinct	.O
and	OU
at	OO
the	OO
moment	,O
we	OO
are	OO
crucially	OO
concerned	OO
about	OO
extinction	.O
so	OU
let's	OO
have	OO
a	OO
look	OO
at	OO
that	,O
let's	OO
explore	OO
that	.O
what	OU
are	OO
the	OO
current	OO
views	?O
and	OU
these	OO
views	OO
are	OO
expressed	OO
not	OO
by	OO
scientists	,O
but	OO
also	OO
by	OO
very	OO
important	OO
politicians	.O
so	OU
some	OO
of	OO
you	OO
may	OO
recall	,O
a	OO
number	OO
of	OO
years	OO
ago	,O
al	OU
gore	,U
who	OO
was	OO
then	OO
vice	OO
president	OO
of	OO
the	OO
united	OU
states	OU
he	OU
quoted	OO
a	OO
figure	OO
of	OO
100	OO
species	OO
are	OO
going	OO
extinct	OO
every	OO
day	.O
so	OU
this	OO
is	OO
a	OO
very	OO
high	OO
rate	OO
of	OO
extinction	,O
100	OO
per	OO
day	,O
which	OO
is	OO
equivalent	OO
to	OO
40,000	OO
per	OO
year	.O
at	OU
the	OO
other	OO
end	,O
other	OO
politicians	,O
perhaps	OO
in	OO
president	OU
trump's	OU
camp	,O
would	OO
say	,O
'don't	OO
worry	OO
about	OO
it	.O
extinction	OU
happens	.O
look	OU
at	OO
the	OO
dinosaurs	.O
we've	OU
got	OO
nothing	OO
to	OO
do.'	OO
so	OU
how	OO
do	OO
you	OO
connect	OO
between	OO
these	OO
two	OO
positions	OO
because	OO
of	OO
course	OO
we	OO
have	OO
to	OO
think	OO
about	OO
these	OO
points	.O
the	OU
first	OO
approach	OO
that	OO
we	OO
use	OO
is	OO
to	OO
look	OO
at	OO
history	.O
we	OU
have	OO
recent	OO
history	OO
recorded	OO
of	OO
extinction	.O
so	OU
many	OO
of	OO
you	OO
will	OO
be	OO
familiar	OO
with	OO
the	OO
extinct	OO
bird	OO
called	OO
the	OO
dodo	.O
this	OU
lived	OO
on	OO
the	OO
island	OO
of	OO
mauritius	OU
in	OO
the	OO
indian	OU
ocean	.U
the	OU
dodo	OO
was	OO
a	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
fat	,O
flightless	OO
bird	OO
related	OO
to	OO
pigeons	,O
and	OO
a	OO
very	OO
famous	OO
image	OO
of	OO
the	OO
dodo	OO
was	OO
in	OO
the	OO
famous	OO
children's	OO
book	OO
'alice	OO
in	OO
wonderland'	,U
where	OO
the	OO
dodo	,O
who	OO
is	OO
a	OO
wise	,O
old	OO
gentleman	OO
with	OO
a	OO
walking	OO
stick	OO
organises	OO
alice	OU
and	OO
all	OO
the	OO
animals	OO
and	OO
says	OO
to	OO
them	,O
'we	OO
will	OO
have	OO
a	OO
caucus	OU
race.'	OO
and	OU
a	OO
caucus	OU
race	OO
is	OO
one	OO
where	OO
people	OO
start	OO
when	OO
they	OO
like	OO
and	OO
they	OO
finish	OO
when	OO
they	OO
like	,O
and	OO
everybody	OO
gets	OO
a	OO
prize	.O
so	OU
that	OO
was	OO
very	OO
nice	,O
but	OO
unfortunately	OO
the	OO
dodo	OO
in	OO
real	OO
life	OO
didn't	OO
get	OO
a	OO
prize	.O
because	OU
some	OO
of	OO
you	OO
may	OO
know	OO
the	OO
first	OO
records	OO
of	OO
dodos	OO
were	OO
in	OO
1598	OO
when	OO
seamen	OO
reported	OO
they	OO
had	OO
seen	OO
this	OO
bird	.O
they	OU
could	OO
go	OO
on	OO
the	OO
island	OO
and	OO
catch	OO
it	OO
very	OO
easily	OO
and	OO
eat	OO
it	.O
and	OU
within	OO
60	OO
years	OO
it	OO
was	OO
extinct	.O
another	OU
example	OO
of	OO
recorded	OO
extinction	OO
is	OO
the	OO
great	OO
auk	.O
this	OU
was	OO
a	OO
large	OO
bird	OO
that	OO
lived	OO
in	OO
the	OO
north	OU
atlantic	,U
and	OO
the	OO
great	OO
auk	OO
went	OO
extinct	OO
in	OO
1844	.O
how	OU
do	OO
we	OO
know	OO
that	?O
because	OU
collectors	OO
sent	OO
by	OO
a	OO
museum	OO
shot	OO
the	OO
last	OO
example	.O
they	OU
were	OO
concerned	OO
that	OO
their	OO
museum	OO
did	OO
not	OO
have	OO
a	OO
stuffed	OO
specimen	OO
of	OO
this	OO
bird	.O
they	OU
heard	OO
it	OO
was	OO
going	OO
extinct	,O
so	OO
they	OO
thought	,O
'we'd	OO
better	OO
get	OO
one	OO
before	OO
it	OO
dies	OO
out.'	OO
so	OU
these	OO
are	OO
two	OO
examples	OO
of	OO
data	OO
about	OO
extinction	.O
and	OU
indeed	OO
through	OO
the	OO
last	OO
500	OO
years	,O
mankind	OO
has	OO
killed	OO
many	OO
species	OO
which	OO
are	OO
recorded	OO
like	OO
that	.O
and	OU
this	OO
is	OO
the	OO
basis	OO
of	OO
the	OO
figure	OO
that	OO
al	OU
gore	OU
gave	.O
let	OU
me	OO
explain	OO
it	.O
he	OU
gave	OO
that	OO
figure	OO
of	OO
100	OO
species	OO
per	OO
day	OO
going	OO
extinct	.O
this	OU
was	OO
based	OO
on	OO
the	OO
bird	OO
data	.O
but	OU
we	OO
know	OO
something	OO
like	OO
100	OO
or	OO
two	OO
or	OO
three	OO
hundred	OO
species	OO
of	OO
birds	OO
have	OO
been	OO
killed	OO
by	OO
human	OO
activity	OO
in	OO
the	OO
last	OO
500	OO
years	.O
and	OU
the	OO
figures	OO
are	OO
debated	.O
it's	OU
something	OO
like	OO
from	OO
half	OO
a	OO
species	OO
to	OO
four	OO
species	OO
each	OO
year	OO
on	OO
average	.O
we	OU
don't	OO
know	OO
for	OO
sure	OO
because	OO
of	OO
course	OO
people	OO
didn't	OO
record	OO
everything	.O
now	,U
how	OO
do	OO
we	OO
scale	OO
this	OO
up	OO
to	OO
get	OO
a	OO
global	OO
figure	,O
from	OO
birds	OO
on	OO
the	OO
one	OO
hand	OO
to	OO
all	OO
of	OO
life	?O
and	OU
the	OO
way	OO
it	OO
was	OO
done	OO
was	OO
simply	OO
to	OO
say	,O
'we	OO
know	OO
how	OO
many	OO
species	OO
or	OO
birds	OO
there	OO
are	OO
alive	OO
today.'	OO
there	OU
are	OO
10,000	,O
and	OO
the	OO
initial	OO
estimate	OO
for	OO
the	OO
diversity	OO
of	OO
all	OO
of	OO
life	OO
were	OO
100	OO
million	.O
so	OU
you	OO
scale	OO
from	OO
four	OO
a	OO
day	OO
upwards	,O
and	OO
that	OO
brings	OO
you	OO
up	OO
to	OO
this	OO
figure	OO
of	OO
100	OO
per	OO
day	OO
by	OO
multiplying	OO
up	OO
many	OO
times;	OO
40,000	OO
lost	OO
per	OO
year	,O
100	OO
per	OO
day	,O
based	OO
on	OO
that	OO
extreme	OO
high	OO
bird	OO
figure	.O
at	OU
the	OO
other	OO
end	,O
the	OO
lowest	OO
estimate	OO
is	OO
something	OO
like	OO
one	OO
species	OO
per	OO
day	.O
this	OU
is	OO
because	OO
we	OO
are	OO
not	OO
sure	OO
about	OO
that	OO
bird	OO
figure	,O
so	OO
we	OO
could	OO
take	OO
a	OO
lower	OO
estimate	,O
and	OO
also	OO
we	OO
are	OO
actually	OO
not	OO
sure	OO
about	OO
the	OO
diversity	OO
of	OO
life	OO
today	OO
either	.O
some	OU
of	OO
you	OO
will	OO
know	OO
that	OO
you	OO
might	OO
think	OO
we	OO
would	OO
have	OO
named	OO
every	OO
species	,O
we	OO
would	OO
know	OO
that	OO
we	OO
don't	.O
you	OU
can	OO
look	OO
at	OO
wikipedia	.U
there	OU
are	OO
thousands	OO
and	OO
thousands	OO
of	OO
pages	OO
describing	OO
all	OO
the	OO
living	OO
species	,O
but	OO
there	OO
are	OO
so	OO
many	OO
living	OO
species	OO
that	OO
we	OO
have	OO
never	OO
discovered	,O
never	OO
described	,O
aren't	OO
there	OO
in	OO
wikipedia	.U
so	OU
there	OO
is	OO
that	OO
uncertainty	.O
one	OU
hundred	OO
million	?O
ten	OU
million	?O
we	OU
don't	OO
know	.O
those	OU
are	OO
the	OO
estimates	OO
of	OO
numbers	OO
of	OO
species	OO
going	OO
extinct	OO
each	OO
day	.O
one	OU
per	OO
day	,O
one	OO
hundred	OO
per	OO
day	.O
do	OU
we	OO
worry	OO
about	OO
that	?O
this	OU
is	OO
where	OO
palaeontology	OO
comes	OO
in	OO
first	,O
because	OO
fossil	OO
data	OO
allows	OO
us	OO
to	OO
calculate	OO
what	OO
would	OO
be	OO
the	OO
normal	OO
rate	OO
of	OO
extinction	.O
species	OU
do	OO
go	OO
extinct	,O
so	OO
this	OO
politician	OO
over	OO
here	OO
was	OO
quite	OO
right	.O
but	OU
was	OO
al	OU
gore	OU
right	?O
we	OU
don't	OO
know	.O
you	OU
know	,O
he	OO
was	OO
giving	OO
that	OO
high	OO
figure	OO
maybe	OO
somewhere	OO
in	OO
between	.O
but	OU
what	OO
is	OO
the	OO
norm	?O
is	OU
one	OO
a	OO
day	OO
okay	?O
it	OU
doesn't	OO
sound	OO
too	OO
many	.O
if	OU
there	OO
are	OO
millions	OO
and	OO
millions	OO
of	OO
species	,O
it	OO
is	OO
far	OO
too	OO
high	.O
we	OU
know	OO
that	OO
the	OO
average	OO
duration	OO
of	OO
a	OO
species	OO
is	OO
two	OO
million	OO
years	.O
they	OU
originate	,O
they	OO
go	OO
extinct	.O
two	OU
million	OO
years	.O
and	OU
that	OO
means	,O
as	OO
they	OO
come	OO
and	OO
go	,O
on	OO
average	,O
we	OO
would	OO
expect	OO
the	OO
extinction	OO
of	OO
five	OO
million	OO
species	OO
every	OO
million	OO
years	,O
which	OO
is	OO
five	OO
species	OO
per	OO
year	.O
so	OU
that	OO
does	OO
contrast	OO
remarkably	OO
even	OO
at	OO
the	OO
lowest	OO
estimate	OO
of	OO
human	OO
impact	OO
500	OO
species	OO
per	OO
year	OO
is	OO
100	OO
times	OO
the	OO
normal	OO
rate	OO
of	OO
5	OO
per	OO
year	.O
and	OU
at	OO
the	OO
bottom	OO
there	OO
is	OO
the	OO
dodo	,O
just	OO
in	OO
case	OO
you	OO
weren't	OO
sure	OO
what	OO
it	OO
looked	OO
like	.O
so	OU
i	OU
want	OO
to	OO
look	OO
at	OO
two	OO
other	OO
topics	OO
briefly	.O
one	OU
is	OO
risk	.O
and	OU
so	,O
one	OO
of	OO
the	OO
questions	OO
we	OO
would	OO
have	OO
estimating	OO
the	OO
total	OO
numbers	OO
is	OO
one	OO
thing	.O
we	OU
have	OO
learned	OO
that	OO
we	OO
are	OO
impacting	OO
life	OO
harder	OO
than	OO
we	OO
should	OO
be	.O
human	OU
activity	OO
is	OO
causing	OO
extinction	.O
what	OU
about	OO
risk	?O
it's	OU
easy	OO
to	OO
say	OO
of	OO
course	,O
the	OO
dodo	OO
was	OO
stupid	,O
it	OO
lived	OO
on	OO
one	OO
island	,O
it	OO
just	OO
stood	OO
around	OO
and	OO
allowed	OO
itself	OO
to	OO
be	OO
hit	OO
on	OO
the	OO
head	.O
to	OU
an	OO
extent	.O
we	OU
worry	OO
about	OO
elephants	,O
we	OO
worry	OO
about	OO
pandas	,O
we	OO
worry	OO
about	OO
many	OO
individual	OO
species	.O
many	OU
of	OO
those	OO
have	OO
high	OO
risk	OO
factors	.O
so	OU
for	OO
example	,O
an	OO
elephant	OO
is	OO
very	OO
large	.O
this	OU
means	OO
they	OO
need	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
food	,O
they	OO
need	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
territory	OO
to	OO
walk	OO
around	.O
and	OU
so	OO
it's	OO
much	OO
harder	OO
to	OO
keep	OO
a	OO
sufficiently	OO
large	OO
population	OO
of	OO
elephants	OO
breeding	OO
and	OO
successfully	OO
in	OO
the	OO
wild	.O
we	OU
don't	OO
need	OO
to	OO
worry	OO
about	OO
rats	,O
for	OO
example	.O
they're	OU
small	OO
and	OO
there's	OO
lots	OO
of	OO
them	.O
so	OU
body	OO
size	OO
is	OO
one	OO
risk	OO
factor	.O
being	OU
big	OO
is	OO
not	OO
a	OO
good	OO
thing	OO
if	OO
you	OO
want	OO
to	OO
survive	OO
as	OO
a	OO
species	.O
what	OU
about	OO
the	OO
panda	?O
they're	OU
not	OO
so	OO
huge	.O
they're	OU
about	OO
human	OO
size	.O
they	OU
have	OO
a	OO
specialised	OO
diet	.O
they	OU
have	OO
evolved	OO
into	OO
a	OO
crazy	OO
position	.O
as	OU
you	OO
know	,O
they	OO
are	OO
eating	OO
bamboo	OO
without	OO
the	OO
real	OO
ability	OO
to	OO
consume	OO
it	OO
properly	.O
if	OU
that	OO
food	OO
supply	OO
disappears	,O
they're	OO
stuck	.O
so	,U
secondly	,O
restricted	OO
diet	OO
is	OO
a	OO
problem	.O
the	OU
third	OO
one	OO
is	OO
shown	OO
by	OO
the	OO
dodo	.O
if	OU
you	OO
live	OO
in	OO
only	OO
a	OO
very	OO
small	OO
geographic	OO
area	OO
rather	OO
than	OO
over	OO
the	OO
whole	OO
world	,O
you	OO
are	OO
at	OO
risk	.O
so	OU
there	OO
are	OO
three	OO
things	OO
to	OO
be:	OO
medium	OO
sized	OO
or	OO
small	,O
if	OO
you	OO
want	OO
to	OO
survive;	OO
broad	OO
diet	,O
willing	OO
to	OO
eat	OO
everything;	OO
and	OO
living	OO
over	OO
the	OO
whole	OO
world	.O
so	OU
that	OO
includes	OO
human	OO
beings	OO
and	OO
rats	OO
and	OO
cockroaches	.O
they	OU
will	OO
survive	OO
and	OO
many	OO
other	OO
species	OO
will	OO
not	OO
survive	OO
whatever	OO
we	OO
do	.O
so	OU
risk	OO
is	OO
something	OO
we	OO
can	OO
determine	OO
from	OO
the	OO
present	OO
day	,O
but	OO
also	OO
we	OO
can	OO
test	OO
when	OO
we	OO
look	OO
at	OO
mass	OO
extinctions	OO
in	OO
the	OO
past	.O
so	OU
this	OO
is	OO
where	OO
we	OO
come	OO
back	OO
to	OO
palaeontology	,O
because	OO
i	OU
think	OO
most	OO
people	OO
here	OO
know	OO
that	OO
the	OO
end	OO
of	OO
the	OO
dinosaurs	OO
was	OO
marked	OO
by	OO
a	OO
mass	OO
extinction	.O
many	OU
millions	OO
or	OO
thousands	OO
of	OO
species	OO
died	OO
out	OO
rather	OO
rapidly	.O
the	OU
cause	OO
of	OO
that	OO
extinction	OO
definitely	OO
was	OO
largely	OO
the	OO
impact	OO
of	OO
a	OO
meteorite	,O
a	OO
huge	OO
asteroid	,O
maybe	OO
ten	OO
kilometres	OO
across	,O
and	OO
the	OO
model	OO
for	OO
extinction	OO
of	OO
the	OO
dinosaurs	OO
66	OO
million	OO
years	OO
ago	OO
was	OO
the	OO
asteroid	OO
hit	OO
the	OO
earth	OU
this	OO
is	OO
unpredictable	,O
when	OO
this	OO
may	OO
happen	OO
or	OO
not	OO
it	OO
penetrated	OO
into	OO
the	OO
crust	,O
it	OO
vaporised	,O
and	OO
all	OO
that	OO
rock	OO
of	OO
the	OO
asteroid	OO
plus	OO
the	OO
crust	OO
that	OO
it	OO
had	OO
penetrated	OO
turned	OO
into	OO
rocks	OO
and	OO
dust	,O
mainly	OO
dust	.O
this	OU
was	OO
thrown	OO
up	OO
high	OO
into	OO
the	OO
atmosphere	OO
and	OO
went	OO
all	OO
round	OO
the	OO
earth	,U
blacking	OO
out	OO
the	OO
sun	,O
and	OO
so	OO
that	OO
you	OO
get	OO
two	OO
effects	OO
there	,O
no	OO
light	,O
no	OO
heat	.O
so	OU
there	OO
was	OO
a	OO
cessation	OO
of	OO
photosynthesis	.O
the	OU
plants	OO
died	.O
there	OU
was	OO
darkness	OO
and	OO
cold	.O
so	OU
this	OO
was	OO
not	OO
good	OO
for	OO
dinosaurs	OO
and	OO
other	OO
groups	OO
that	OO
enjoyed	OO
the	OO
warm	OO
climates	,O
and	OO
so	OO
you	OO
get	OO
extinction	.O
and	OU
you	OO
might	OO
think	,O
of	OO
course	,O
'what	OO
do	OO
we	OO
learn	OO
from	OO
this?'	OO
yes	,U
that's	OO
all	OO
very	OO
well	,O
but	OO
that's	OO
not	OO
something	OO
we	OO
can	OO
do	OO
anything	OO
about	OO
really	.O
and	OU
indeed	,O
asteroids	OO
do	OO
come	OO
close	OO
to	OO
the	OO
earth	OU
from	OO
time	OO
to	OO
time	.O
earlier	OU
this	OO
week	,O
one	OO
did	.O
luckily	OU
it	OO
didn't	OO
hit	OO
the	OO
earth	.U
we	OU
can't	OO
really	OO
prepare	.O
but	OU
the	OO
key	OO
point	OO
is	OO
that	OO
the	OO
other	OO
mass	OO
extinctions	OO
in	OO
the	OO
history	OO
of	OO
life	OO
were	OO
not	OO
caused	OO
by	OO
impact	.O
they	OU
were	OO
caused	OO
by	OO
climate	OO
change	.O
immediately	,U
you	OO
can	OO
see	OO
now	OO
how	OO
that	OO
matters	.O
i	OU
will	OO
briefly	OO
characterise	OO
one	OO
of	OO
them	OO
that	OO
i	OU
have	OO
worked	OO
upon	.O
at	OU
the	OO
end	OO
of	OO
the	OO
permian	OU
period	,U
250	OO
million	OO
years	OO
ago	,O
there	OO
was	OO
another	OO
major	OO
extinction	.O
this	OU
was	OO
before	OO
the	OO
dinosaurs	.O
and	OU
the	OO
sequence	OO
of	OO
events	OO
was	OO
that	OO
massive	OO
volcanoes	OO
errupted	OO
in	OO
russia	.U
they	OU
were	OO
so	OO
huge	OO
that	OO
they	OO
poured	OO
out	OO
enormous	OO
amounts	OO
of	OO
lava	,O
of	OO
course	,O
but	OO
more	OO
importantly	,O
they	OO
poured	OO
out	OO
gases	OO
into	OO
the	OO
atmosphere	,O
including	OO
carbon	OO
dioxide	.O
and	OU
carbon	OO
dioxide	OO
is	OO
famous	OO
as	OO
a	OO
greenhouse	OO
gas	,O
meaning	OO
it	OO
heats	OO
the	OO
atmosphere	.O
we	OU
have	OO
primary	OO
evidence	OO
that	OO
around	OO
the	OO
equator	,O
ocean	OO
temperatures	OO
warmed	OO
up	OO
to	OO
40	OO
degrees	OO
plus	.O
so	OU
this	OO
is	OO
like	OO
a	OO
very	OO
warm	OO
shower	.O
you	OU
might	OO
think	OO
that's	OO
ok	.U
maybe	OU
for	OO
10	OO
minutes	OO
but	OO
not	OO
for	OO
day	OO
after	OO
day	OO
after	OO
day	.O
and	OU
so	OO
life	OO
had	OO
to	OO
progressively	OO
flee	OO
out	OO
of	OO
the	OO
equatorial	OO
zones	.O
it	OU
became	OO
crowded	OO
at	OO
the	OO
poles	OO
and	OO
there	OO
was	OO
great	OO
extinction	.O
so	OU
we	OO
learnt	OO
from	OO
that	OO
that	OO
carbon	OO
dioxide	OO
and	OO
global	OO
warming	OO
can	OO
cause	OO
extinction	OO
whatever	OO
the	OO
cause	OO
of	OO
that	OO
carbon	OO
dioxide	,O
whether	OO
it	OO
comes	OO
from	OO
volcanoes	OO
or	OO
human	OO
activity	.O
so	OU
we've	OO
learnt	OO
three	OO
things	OO
that	OO
we	OO
can	OO
illustrate	OO
and	OO
use	OO
for	OO
predicting	OO
into	OO
the	OO
future	,O
what	OO
may	OO
happen	OO
to	OO
life	.O
we've	OU
learnt	OO
that	OO
we	OO
can	OO
calculate	OO
the	OO
rate	OO
of	OO
extinction	OO
by	OO
looking	OO
at	OO
historical	OO
extinctions	OO
and	OO
at	OO
that	OO
rate	OO
of	OO
extinction	,O
even	OO
at	OO
the	OO
minimal	OO
figures	,O
it's	OO
at	OO
least	OO
one	OO
hundred	OO
times	OO
what	OO
it	OO
ought	OO
to	OO
be	.O
secondly	,U
we've	OO
learnt	OO
something	OO
about	OO
risk	,O
which	OO
species	OO
are	OO
most	OO
at	OO
risk	OO
of	OO
extinction	,O
and	OO
i	OU
think	OO
that's	OO
fairly	OO
straightforward	.O
but	OU
we	OO
need	OO
the	OO
evidence	OO
to	OO
be	OO
able	OO
to	OO
argue	OO
the	OO
case	.O
and	OU
thirdly	,O
we've	OO
learnt	OO
that	OO
the	OO
whole	OO
history	OO
of	OO
the	OO
earth	OU
records	OO
a	OO
rich	OO
record	OO
of	OO
climate	OO
change	.O
we	OU
don't	OO
need	OO
to	OO
do	OO
experiments	,O
we	OO
don't	OO
need	OO
to	OO
imagine	OO
what	OO
a	OO
world	OO
would	OO
be	OO
like	OO
without	OO
the	OO
polar	OO
ice	OO
caps	.O
it	OU
has	OO
existed	OO
and	OO
we	OO
can	OO
study	OO
it	.O
so	OU
to	OO
conclude	,O
my	OO
aim	OO
has	OO
not	OO
been	OO
simply	OO
to	OO
spread	OO
doom	OO
and	OO
gloom	,O
but	OO
to	OO
indicate	OO
that	OO
we	OO
have	OO
the	OO
power	OO
to	OO
change	.O
and	OU
in	OO
order	OO
to	OO
change	,O
we	OO
have	OO
to	OO
accept	OO
reality	OO
along	OO
the	OO
lines	OO
that	OO
we're	OO
mentioning	.O
and	OU
we	OO
have	OO
to	OO
ask	OO
the	OO
right	OO
questions	OO
about	OO
what	OO
we	OO
should	OO
do	.O
and	OU
in	OO
order	OO
to	OO
decide	OO
what	OO
we	OO
should	OO
do	,O
we	OO
need	OO
to	OO
use	OO
evidence	.O
and	OU
some	OO
great	OO
evidence	OO
comes	OO
from	OO
the	OO
history	OO
of	OO
the	OO
earth	OU
and	OO
the	OO
history	OO
of	OO
life	.O
thank	OU
you	OO
very	OO
much	.O
indeed	,U
for	OO
20	OO

i	OU

everything	OO
about	OO

i	OU

the	OO

because	OO
it	OO

my	OO

all	OU
the	OO
topics	OO
that	OO
you	OO

bring	OO
up	OO
about	OO
ecology	,O
the	OO

of	OO
the	OO

that	OO
i	OU

i	OU

them	.O
in	OU
2007	,O
an	OO
extremely	OO
unusual	OO
event	OO
occurred	,O
you	OO

remember	,O
the	OO
subprime	OO

the	OO
collapse	OO
of	OO

it	OU
was	OO
an	OO

i	OU
had	OO
a	OO

on	OO
the	OO

of	OO

besides	OU
the	OO
crisis	,O
i	OU
realized	OO
that	OO
i	OU
was	OO
completely	OO
wrong	,O
that	OO
we	OO
were	OO

the	OU

within	OO
a	OO
few	OO
months	.O
that's	OU
why	OO
i'm	OU
here	OO
tonight	,O
i've	OU
realized	OO
that	,O
finally	,O
it	OO
wasn't	OO
all	OO
so	OO
bad	,O
and	OO
that	OO
it	OO
was	OO
an	OO
opportunity	OO
because	OO
we	OO
have	OO
the	OO
exceptional	OO
opportunity	OO
of	OO
living	OO
in	OO
an	OO
exceptional	OO
period	OO
of	OO
human	OO
history:	OO
we	OO
are	OO
going	OO
to	OO
change	OO
the	OO
world	.O
but	OU
before	OO
changing	OO
the	OO
world	,O
we	OO
have	OO
to	OO
do	OO
something	,O
we	OO
have	OO
to	OO

some	OO

we	OO

to	OO

is	OO
climate	OO

those	OO

the	OO

the	OO

these	OU
two	OO
first	OO
factors	OO
result	OO
in:	OO
when	OO
the	OO
ecosystems	OO
are	OO
destabilized	OO
and	OO
there	OO
is	OO
a	OO
shortage	OO
of	OO

we	OO
continue	OO

conflicts	,O
we	OO

let	OO
me	OO
remind	OO
you	,O
at	OO
the	OO
moment	OO
france	OU

at	OO
war	OO
in	OO
mali;	OU
let's	OO
not	OO
forget	OO
that	.O
fourth	OU
factor	,O
equally	OO
important	OO
than	OO
the	OO
last	OO
one	,O
the	OO
cancellation	OO
of	OO

the	OO

that	OO

unknown	,O
we	OO
don't	OO
know	OO
what	OO
will	OO
come	.O
and	OU
the	OO
fifth	OO
factor	,O
not	OO
the	OO
least	OO
worrisome:	OO
the	OO
blindness	OO
of	OO
our	OO
elites	.O
in	OU
this	OO
whole	OO
collapse	OO
of	OO
the	OO
civilization	,O
the	OO
elites	OO

the	OO

their	OO

they	OU
are	OO
incapable	OO
of	OO
changing	OO
their	OO
prism	OO
for	OO
the	OO
analysis	.O
and	OU
the	OO
result	?O
the	OU
result	OO
is	OO
simple:	OO
we	OO
will	OO
have	OO
a	OO
political	OO
caste	OO
system	OO
which	OO
emphasizes	,O
which	OO
accelerates	OO
the	OO

a	OO

let's	OU
see	OO
if	OO
the	OO
factors	OO
of	OO
a	OO
renaissance	OO
are	OO
reunited	.O
first	OU
factor	OO
of	OO
a	OO
renaissance	OO
is	OO
a	OO
new	OO
understanding	OO
of	OO
the	OO
world	.O
in	OU
the	OO

what	OU
happens	OO
at	OO
the	OO
moment	,O
for	OO
some	OO

we	OU
discover	OO
the	OO
finiteness	OO
of	OO
the	OO

the	OU

very	OO
small	OO
in	OO

capacity	,O
if	OO
we	OO
look	OO
at	OO
the	OO
current	OO
economic	OO

new	OU
understanding	.O
second	OU
factor:	OO
the	OU
renaissance	OU
is	OO
a	OO
period	OO
of	OO
very	OO
much	OO
creativity	.O
we	OU
all	OO
know	OO
leonardo	OU

the	OO

printing	OO
is	OO
only	OO
one	OO
example	.O
there	OU
are	OO
lots	OO
of	OO
others	.O
third	OU
factor	OO
of	OO
the	OO
renaissance:	OU
contrary	OU
to	OO
common	OO
beliefs	,O
the	OO
renaissance	OU
was	OO
not	OO
only	OO
a	OO
period	OO
of	OO
creativity	,O
but	OO
also	OO
of	OO
much	OO
violence:	OO
religious	OO

basis	,O
and	OO
children	OO
which	OO
get	OO
killed	OO
in	OO

by	OO
automatic	OO
weapons	.O
fourth	OU
factor	OO
of	OO
a	OO
renaissance:	OO
the	OU
whole	OO
world	OO
knows	OO
gutenberg	OU
the	OO
inventor	OO
of	OO
the	OO
printing	OO
press	OO
who	OO
fundamentally	OO
changed	OO
the	OO
distribution	OO
of	OO
knowledge	OO
in	OO
europe	,U
and	OO
later	OO
in	OO
the	OO
rest	OO
of	OO
the	OO
world	.O
imagine	,U
today	,O
there	OO
is	OO
a	OO
new	OO
technological	OO
tool	OO
which	OO
allows	OO
us	OO
to	OO
distribute	OO
knowledge	OO
in	OO
a	OO
whole	OO
new	OO
way	.O
this	OU
tool	,O
which	OO
we	OO
have	OO
in	OO
our	OO
hands	,O
provides	OO
instantaneous	OO
information	.O
we	OU
hold	OO
the	OO
knowledge	OO
of	OO
the	OO
world	OO
in	OO
our	OO
hands	.O
soon	,U
we	OO
will	OO
see	OO
how	OO
this	OO
is	OO
going	OO
to	OO
change	.O
and	OU
finally	,O
a	OO
renaissance	OO
that	OO
brings	OO
me	OO
to	OO
the	OO
subject	OO
of	OO
today	OO
it's	OO
the	OO
fact	OO
that	OO
all	OO
the	OO
certainties	OO
of	OO
humanity	OO
have	OO
fallen	OO
apart	.O
let	OU
me	OO
remind	OO
you	,O
from	OO
aristoteles	OU
through	OO
ptolemy	OU
in	OO
the	OO
2nd	OO
century	OO
to	OO
the	OO
renaissance	,U
the	OO
earth	OU
was	OO
flat	,O
man	OO
was	OO
the	OO
center	OO
of	OO
the	OO
world	,O
and	OO
the	OO
stars	OO
turned	OO
around	OO
us	.O
and	OU
those	OO
who	OO
dared	OO
to	OO
question	OO
this	OO
unique	OO
thought	,O
those	OO
who	OO
dared	OO
to	OO
dispute	OO
this	OO
received	,O
non	OO
negotiable	OO
truth	,O
you	OO
know	OO
what	OO
came	OO
next	OO
had	OO
to	OO
deal	OO
with	OO
the	OO
inquisition	.U
at	OU
the	OO
stake	,O
they	OO
had	OO
to	OO
answer	OO
the	OO
question	.O
copernicus	OU
and	OO
galilee	OU
had	OO
nearly	OO
paid	OO
with	OO
their	OO
lives	OO
because	OO
they	OO
dared	OO
to	OO
say	OO
that	OO
the	OO
earth	OU
was	OO
not	OO
flat	OO
and	OO
it	OO
was	OO
not	OO
the	OO
center	OO
of	OO
the	OO
universe	.O
so	OU
today	,O
the	OO
question	OO
presenting	OO
itself	OO
to	OO
us	OO
in	OO
the	OO
21st	OO
century	OO
is:	OO
are	OU
we	OO
committing	OO
the	OO
same	OO
mistake	OO
as	OO
our	OO
ancestors	?O
are	OU
we	,O
also	OO
in	OO
making	OO
the	OO
mistake	,O
or	OO
in	OO
our	OO
certainties	,O
the	OO
ones	OO
who	OO
will	OO
fall	OO
apart	OO
over	OO
the	OO
next	OO
few	OO
years	?O
the	OU
next	OO
question	OO
which	OO
follows	OO
is:	OO
what	OU
are	OO
those	OO
certainties	OO
which	OO
are	OO
of	OO
received	OO
and	OO
non	OO
negotiable	OO
value	,O
which	OO
could	OO
fall	OO
apart	OO
in	OO
10	,O
15	,O
20	,O
or	OO
50	OO
years	?O
there	OU
are	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
them	.O
as	OU
a	OO
former	OO
economist	,O
there	OO
are	OO
at	OO
least	OO
three	OO
certainties	OO
in	OO
economy	.O
at	OU
first	,O
there	OO
is	OO
the	OO
truth	OO
that	OO
growth	OO
is	OO
the	OO
only	OO
motor	OO
of	OO
the	OO
economy	.O
let	OU
me	OO
remind	OO
you	OO
what	OO
the	OO
word	OO
'economy'	OO
means	OO
in	OO
greek	.U
economy	OU
means	OO
resource	OO
management	,O
domain	OO
and	OO
household	OO
management	.O
so	OU
it	OO
doesn't	OO
necessarily	OO
mean	OO
growth	.O
it's	OU
not	OO
a	OO
synonym	.O
second	OU
truth	OO
which	OO
could	OO
fall	OO
apart	OO
is	OO
that	OO
growth	OO
is	OO
infinite	.O
that's	OU
our	OO
consumption	OO
model	OO
in	OO
a	OO
finite	OO
and	OO
increasingly	OO
shrinking	OO
world	OO
as	OO
the	OO
population	OO
grows	OO
more	OO
and	OO
more	OO
but	OO
with	OO
less	OO
resources	.O
and	OU
we	OO
don't	OO
question	OO
this	OO
dogma	.O
third	OU
dogma	,O
third	OO
received	OO
truth	OO
is	OO
the	OO
necessary	OO
sacrifice	OO
of	OO
the	OO
living	OO
in	OO
favor	OO
of	OO
this	OO
growth	.O
but	OU
still	,O
we	OO
have	OO
authorized	OO
the	OO
right	OO
to	OO
pollute	,O
to	OO
right	OO
to	OO
poison	,O
the	OO
right	OO
to	OO
intoxicate	.O
why	?U
because	OU
growth	OO
demands	OO
it	.O
the	OU
question	OO
that	OO
we	OO
are	OO
confronted	OO
with	OO
today	OO
is:	OO
if	OU
we	OO
continue	OO
like	OO
this	,O
if	OO
we	OO
continue	OO
to	OO
sacrify	OO
the	OO
living	,O
do	OO
we	OO
challenge	OO
this	,O
will	OO
we	OO
authorize	OO
this	OO
dialogue	?O
the	OU
answer	OO
is	OO
also	OO
not	OO
that	OO
evident	OO
because	OO
we	OO
can	OO
ask	OO
ourselves	OO
if	OO
the	OO
people	OO
who	OO
question	OO
these	OO
dogmas	OO
of	OO
growth	OO
as	OO
motor	OO
of	OO
the	OO
economy	,O
and	OO
of	OO
the	OO
myth	OO
of	OO
infinite	OO
growth	OO
are	OO
today	OO
maybe	OO
still	OO
seen	OO
like	OO
yesterday's	OO
heretics	.O
i	OU
must	OO
say	OO
that	OO
i	OU
am	OO
not	OO
sure	,O
that	OO
at	OO
this	OO
time	,O
in	OO
the	OO
21st	OO
century	,O
we	OO
show	OO
a	OO
great	OO
wisdom	OO
to	OO
those	OO
who	OO
dare	OO
to	OO
question	OO
a	OO
system	OO
which	OO
we	OO
all	OO
benefit	OO
from	.O
it	OU
should	OO
be	OO
extremely	OO
important	OO
for	OO
us	OO
to	OO
keep	OO
an	OO
open	OO
mind	.O
and	OU
yet	,O
we	OO
become	OO
more	OO
and	OO
more	OO
people	.O
all	OU
here	,O
i	OU
think	,O
are	OO
convinced	OO
of	OO
the	OO
fact	OO
that	OO
we	OO
know	OO
that	OO
the	OO
road	OO
we	OO
have	OO
taken	OO
for	OO
two	OO
centuries	OO
leads	OO
us	OO
directly	OO
to	OO
how	OO
did	OO
the	OO
philosopher	OO
jonas	OU
say	?O
to	OU
a	OO
tragic	OO
impasse	.O
the	OU
economic	OO
development	OO
on	OO
which	OO
we	OO
base	OO
our	OO
model	OO
leads	OO
us	OO
to	OO
a	OO
tragic	OO
impasse	.O
hans	OU
jonas	OU
adds	OO
a	OO
very	OO
beautiful	OO
expression:	OO
nature	OU
will	OO
eventually	OO
make	OO
its	OO
ultimate	OO
veto	,O
anyway	,O
and	OO
it	OO
will	OO
be	OO
over	.O
after	OU
what	OO
i	OU
just	OO
said	,O
another	OO
question	OO
arises	OO
i	OU
am	OO
concerned	OO
with	OO
personally:	OO
what	OU
will	OO
our	OO
children	OO
and	OO
descendants	OO
think	OO
of	OO
our	OO
behavior	,O
our	OO
stubbornness	OO
of	OO
our	OO
obsession	OO
of	OO
a	OO
destructive	OO
economic	OO
model	?O
it	OU
is	OO
very	OO
likely	OO
that	OO
they	OO
will	OO
call	OO
us	OO
perhaps	OO
barbarians	OO
of	OO
the	OO
living	OO
world	,O
and	OO
maybe	OO
they	OO
will	OO
feel	OO
the	OO
same	OO
contempt	,O
the	OO
same	OO
indignation	OO
which	OO
we	OO
can	OO
feel	OO
today	OO
about	OO
those	OO
who	OO
developed	OO
slavery	OO
two	OO
or	OO
three	OO
centuries	OO
ago	.O
our	OU
behavior	OO
today	OO
is	OO
not	OO
any	OO
better	OO
than	OO
that	OO
of	OO
those	OO
we	OO
despise	OO
today	.O
why	?U
because	OU
three	OO
centuries	OO
ago	,O
slavery	OO
was	OO
non	OO
negotiable	.O
the	OU
european	OU
and	OO
american	OU
economic	OO
model	OO
was	OO
based	OO
on	OO
slavery	.O
and	OU
today	,O
in	OO
2013	,O
what	OO
happens	?O
our	OU
entire	OO
economic	OO
model	,O
our	OO
entire	OO
society	OO
is	OO
based	OO
on	OO
what	?O
on	OU
exploitation	,O
on	OO
the	OO
sacrifice	OO
of	OO
the	OO
living	.O
the	OU
question	,O
which	,O
of	OO
course	,O
arises	OO
is	,O
what	OU
are	OO
we	OO
going	OO
to	OO
do	?O
but	OU
before	OO
we	OO
know	OO
what	OO
we	OO
will	OO
do	OO
we	OO
have	OO
to	OO
know	OO
why	OO
we	OO
got	OO
there	OO
in	OO
order	OO
not	OO
to	OO
commit	OO
the	OO
same	OO
mistake	OO
in	OO
tomorrow's	OO
world	.O
and	OU
how	OO
did	OO
we	OO
get	OO
there	?O
the	OU
answer	OO
is	OO
simple	OO
and	OO
can	OO
be	OO
said	OO
in	OO
a	OO
few	OO
words	.O
the	OU
philosopher	OO
descartes	OU
already	OO
said	OO
it	OO
four	OO
centuries	OO
ago:	OO
man	OU
is	OO
the	OO
only	OO
master	OO
and	OO
owner	OO
of	OO
nature	.O
period	.U
we	OU
dominate	OO
nature	,O
we	OO
shape	OO
and	OO
form	OO
it	.O
we	OU
do	OO
what	OO
we	OO
want	.O
but	OU
what	OO
has	OO
happened	OO
since	OO
this	OO
cartesian	OU
thought	?O
we	OU
consider	OO
nature	OO
as	OO
a	OO
bottomless	OO
pit	,O
as	OO
a	OO
mine	OO
where	OO
we	OO
draw	OO
from	OO
and	OO
throw	OO
things	.O
and	OU
that's	OO
the	OO
problem	.O
we	OU
consider	OO
this	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
nature	OO
as	OO
what	?O
finally	,U
that	OO
puts	OO
man	OO
outside	OO
of	OO
nature	.O
and	OU
this	OO
exteriority	OO
is	OO
our	OO
problem	.O
in	OU
1990	,O
michel	OU
serres	OU
had	OO
an	OO
extremely	OO
truthful	OO
thought	,O
like	OO
always	,O
he	OO
said:	OO
but	OU
finally	,O
the	OO
notion	OO
of	OO
nature	OO
is	OO
a	OO
problem	OO
for	OO
us	OO
because	OO
nature	OO
assumes	OO
that	OO
man	OO
is	OO
put	OO
into	,O
surrounded	OO
by	OO
a	OO
living	OO
world	.O
we	OU
are	OO
disconnected	OO
from	OO
nature	.O
as	OU
long	OO
as	OO
we	OO
haven't	OO
solved	OO
that	OO
problem	,O
as	OO
long	OO
as	OO
we	OO
haven't	OO
reconciled	OO
with	OO
nature	,O
it	OO
won't	OO
work	.O
it's	OU
not	OO
about	OO
sacralizing	OO
nature	,O
or	OO
putting	OO
it	OO
on	OO
an	OO
altar	OO
like	OO
a	OO
sacred	OO
goddess	,O
it's	OO
just	OO
about	OO
including	OO
nature	OO
and	OO
not	OO
acting	OO
against	OO
or	OO
without	OO
it	.O
well	,U
how	OO
are	OO
we	OO
going	OO
to	OO
do	OO
that	?O
the	OU
conclusion	OO
of	OO
my	OO
talk	OO
is	OO
we'll	OO
have	OO
to	OO
organize	OO
it	,O
really	OO
simple	.O
it's	OU
extremely	OO
simple	,O
we	OO
need	OO
a	OO
new	OO
controversy	.O
what	OU
is	OO
a	OO
controversy	?O
it's	OU
a	OO
dispute	,O
a	OO
global	OO

that	OO

it's	OU

so	,U
i'm	OU
here	OO
to	OO

you	.O
but	OU
not	OO
in	OO
the	OO
sense	OO
that	OO
you're	OO
thinking	.O
i	OU
know	OO
i'm	OU
a	OO
politician	.O
i'll	OU
save	OO
that	OO
for	OO
another	OO
day	.O
i'm	OU
here	OO
to	OO
try	OO
and	OO
encourage	OO
you	OO
to	OO
take	OO
up	OO
a	OO
leadership	OO
role	OO
in	OO
public	OO
service	OO
in	OO
your	OO
country	OO
and	OO
on	OO
your	OO
continent	.O
i'm	OU
here	OO
to	OO
convince	OO
you	OO
that	OO
your	OO
country	OO
and	OO
your	OO
continent	OO
need	OO
you	OO
not	OO
later	,O
not	OO
when	OO
you're	OO
older	OO
and	OO
more	OO
experienced	,O
but	OO
now	OO
and	OO
that	OO
whether	OO
you	OO
realize	OO
it	OO
or	OO
not	,O
your	OO
country's	OO
politics	OO
are	OO
going	OO
to	OO
be	OO
doomed	OO
to	OO
fail	OO
unless	OO
you're	OO
willing	OO
to	OO
get	OO
involved	OO
right	OO
now	.O
so	OU
my	OO
recruitment	OO
pitch	OO
comes	OO
with	OO
a	OO
single	OO
disclaimer:	OO
i	OU
resigned	OO
from	OO
public	OO
office	OO
18	OO
months	OO
ago	.O
i	OU
did	OO
it	OO
in	OO
order	OO
to	OO
take	OO
stock	OO
of	OO
my	OO
time	OO
in	OO
office	,O
to	OO
think	OO
about	OO
the	OO
work	OO
that	OO
i	OU
had	OO
done	,O
to	OO
capacitate	OO
myself	OO
with	OO
skills	,O
knowledge	,O
contacts	,O
allies	OO
and	OO
experiences	,O
and	OO
to	OO
find	OO
a	OO
little	OO
bit	OO
of	OO
personal	OO
and	OO
professional	OO
perspective	.O
it's	OU
one	OO
of	OO
the	OO
best	OO
decisions	OO
i	OU
think	OO
i've	OU
ever	OO
made	.O
i	OU
imagine	OO
that	OO
some	OO
time	OO
during	OO
the	OO
next	OO
18	OO
minutes	OO
while	OO
i'm	OU
pitching	OO
you	,O
you're	OO
going	OO
to	OO
think	,O
yeah	,U
it's	OO
easy	OO
for	OO
you	OO
to	OO
say	OO
i	OU
should	OO
go	OO
into	OO
public	OO
service	.O
you've	OU
already	OO
done	OO
it	OO
and	OO
you've	OO
left	.O
but	OU
i	OU
hope	OO
i'll	OU
be	OO
able	OO
to	OO
convince	OO
you	OO
that	,O
in	OO
fact	,O
we	OO
all	OO
find	OO
ourselves	OO
in	OO
exactly	OO
the	OO
same	OO
boat	OO
right	OO
now	.O
because	OU
being	OO
outside	OO
of	OO
politics	OO
for	OO
18	OO
months	OO
has	OO
reminded	OO
me	OO
just	OO
how	OO
important	OO
it	OO
is	OO
and	OO
just	OO
how	OO
much	OO
the	OO
political	OO
landscapes	OO
in	OO
my	OO
country	OO
and	OO
in	OO
your	OO
countries	OO
and	OO
on	OO
our	OO
continent	OO
are	OO
truly	OO
lacking	OO
in	OO
good	OO
leadership	OO
and	OO
political	OO
talent	.O
so	,U
i	OU
want	OO
to	OO
make	OO
a	OO
deal	OO
with	OO
you	.O
i'm	OU
not	OO
going	OO
to	OO
return	OO
to	OO
active	OO
politics	OO
unless	OO
you	OO
come	OO
with	OO
me	.O
i'm	OU
not	OO
going	OO
to	OO
do	OO
it	OO
alone	.O
i	OU
won't	OO
go	OO
back	OO
unless	OO
i	OU
can	OO
convince	OO
smart	,O
entrepreneurial	,O
highly	OO
skilled	,O
talented	,O
experienced	OO
young	OO
africans	OU
like	OO
yourselves	OO
and	OO
millions	OO
more	OO
like	OO
you	OO
across	OO
the	OO
continent	,O
that	OO
the	OO
best	OO
chance	OO
that	OO
our	OO
countries	OO
have	,O
not	OO
just	OO
for	OO
survival	OO
but	OO
for	OO
lasting	OO
prosperity	,O
is	OO
if	OO
our	OO
most	OO
talented	OO
citizens	OO
step	OO
forward	OO
and	OO
make	OO
themselves	OO
available	,O
either	OO
for	OO
political	OO
party	,O
leadership	OO
or	OO
for	OO
public	OO
service	OO
and	OO
government	.O
so	OU
over	OO
the	OO
next	OO
16	OO
or	OO
so	OO
minutes	OO
that	OO
are	OO
remaining	,O
i'm	OU
going	OO
to	OO
alternately	OO
flatter	OO
you	,O
as	OO
i	OU
just	OO
have	,O
i'm	OU
going	OO
to	OO
challenge	OO
you	,O
i'm	OU
going	OO
to	OO
talk	OO
to	OO
you	OO
about	OO
my	OO
experiences	,O
about	OO
a	OO
couple	OO
of	OO
facts	OO
and	OO
figures;	OO
i	OU
may	OO
even	OO
frighten	OO
you	OO
a	OO
little	OO
bit	.O
and	OU
it'll	OO
be	OO
entirely	OO
worth	OO
it	OO
if	OO
that	OO
fear	OO
convinces	OO
you	OO
of	OO
the	OO
urgency	OO
of	OO
the	OO
point	OO
in	OO
history	OO
that	OO
we	OO
find	OO
ourselves	OO
in	OO
today	.O
everything	OU
i	OU
say	OO
today	OO
will	OO
be	OO
in	OO
service	OO
of	OO
a	OO
single	OO
objective:	OO
convincing	OO
you	,O
showing	OO
you	,O
that	OO
your	OO
countries	OO
need	OO
you;	OO
that	OO
africa's	OU
prosperity	OO
may	OO
depend	OO
on	OO
many	OO
things	OO
entrepreneurialism	,O
industrial	OO
development	,O
health	OO
reform	,O
social	OO
upliftment	OO
but	OO
that	OO
all	OO
of	OO
these	OO
hinge	OO
upon	OO
the	OO
success	OO
of	OO
politics	OO
and	OO
government	OO
in	OO
our	OO
countries	.O
i	OU
can't	OO
begin	OO
a	OO
talk	OO
about	OO
public	OO
service	,O
of	OO
course	,O
without	OO
honoring	OO
my	OO
former	OO
president	OO
nelson	OU
mandela	,U
the	OO
father	OO
of	OO
democratic	OO
south	OU
africa	.U
president	OU
mandela	OU
passed	OO
away	OO
on	OO
this	OO
day	OO
in	OO
2013	.O
i	OU
really	OO
believe	OO
that	OO
when	OO
the	OO
people	OO
of	OO
my	OO
country	OO
look	OO
back	OO
on	OO
the	OO
day	OO
that	OO
he	OO
passed	OO
away	,O
it'll	OO
be	OO
seen	OO
as	OO
an	OO
inflection	OO
point	OO
in	OO
south	OU
africa's	OU
history	.O
the	OU
day	OO
we	OO
decided	OO
whether	OO
we	OO
could	,O
indeed	,O
go	OO
it	OO
alone	OO
without	OO
him	.O
what's	OU
written	OO
in	OO
those	OO
history	OO
books	OO
will	OO
depend	OO
entirely	OO
on	OO
whether	OO
this	OO
generation	,O
which	OO
includes	OO
all	OO
of	OO
you	OO
sitting	OO
in	OO
this	OO

recognizes	OO
that	OO
the	OO
time	OO
has	OO
come	OO
for	OO
us	OO
to	OO
take	OO
up	OO
the	OO
work	OO
that	OO
president	OU
mandela	OU
left	OO
for	OO
us	,O
before	OO
that	OO
work	OO
is	OO
captured	OO
by	OO
people	OO
who	OO
would	OO
use	OO
power	OO
and	OO
politics	OO
for	OO
empty	OO
vanity	OO
and	OO
personal	OO
gain	.O
i'm	OU
referring	,O
of	OO

to	OO
the	OO
young	OO

who	OO

here	OO
in	OO

this	OO

the	OO

us	.O
so	OU
let	OO
us	OO
begin	.O
i	OU
want	OO
to	OO
first	OO
talk	OO
to	OO
you	OO
about	OO
the	OO
african	OU
diaspora	.O
you	OU
may	OO
have	OO
heard	OO
about	OO
a	OO

that	OO

that	OO
cash	OO

from	OO

now	OO

in	OU

saharan	OU
africa	OU
totalled	OO
44.6	OO

by	OO

now	,U
this	OO
got	OO
me	OO
thinking	.O
if	OU
we	OO
can	OO
do	OO
such	OO
great	OO
work	OO
with	OO
our	OO
money	OO
from	OO
outside	OO
of	OO
africa	,U
what	OO
can	OO
we	OO
do	OO
with	OO
our	OO
skills	,O
our	OO
talent	,O
our	OO
experiences	,O
our	OO
education	OO
and	OO
our	OO
passion	OO
for	OO
our	OO
countries	OO
and	OO
for	OO
our	OO

i've	OU
spent	OO
the	OO
past	OO

at	OO
the	OO
harvard	OU
kennedy	OU
school	OU
as	OO
a	OO
fellow	OO
at	OO
the	OO
institute	OU
of	OO
politics	.U
i	OU
ran	OO
a	OO
seminar	OO
which	OO
was	OO
called	OO
how	OU
to	OO
build	OO
a	OO
democracy	?O
lessons	OU
from	OO
south	OU
africa	.U
it	OU
was	OO
also	OO
about	OO
zimbabwe	OU
and	OO
malawi	.U
and	OU
it	OO
wasn't	OO
intended	OO
to	OO
make	OO
it	OO
seem	OO
like	OO
we	OO
got	OO
everything	OO
right	OO
in	OO
south	OU
africa	,U
but	OO
it	OO
was	OO
asking	OO
the	OO
critical	OO
question:	OO
now	OU
that	OO
we	OO
have	OO
this	OO
legacy	OO
of	OO
peaceful	OO
transition	,O
of	OO
constitutionalism	,O
of	OO
difficult	OO
negotiations	,O
which	OO
were	OO
very	,O
very	OO
difficultly	OO
gotten	,O
are	OO
we	OO
going	OO
to	OO
be	OO
successful	OO
in	OO
entrenching	OO
that	OO
democracy	OO
and	OO
making	OO
it	OO
last	OO
into	OO
the	OO
future	?O
now	,U
one	OO
of	OO
the	OO
benefits	OO
of	OO
being	OO
an	OO
african	OU
in	OO
an	OO
academic	OO
setting	OO
like	OO
new	OU
england	OU
is	OO
that	OO
other	OO
african	OU
students	OO
reach	OO
out	OO
to	OO
you	,O
they	OO
want	OO
to	OO
talk	OO
to	OO
you	,O
and	OO
many	OO
of	OO
them	OO
express	OO
to	OO
you	OO
their	OO
desire	OO
to	OO
enter	OO
public	OO
service	.O
so	OU
i	OU
had	OO
students	OO
knocking	OO
down	OO
my	OO
door	,O
wanting	OO
to	OO
talk	OO
to	OO
me	OO
in	OO
office	OO
hours	OO
about	OO
the	OO
fact	OO
that	OO
they	OO
have	OO
ghanean	OU
parents	OO
but	OO
they	OO
were	OO
born	OO
in	OO
texas	.U
they	OU
really	OO
wanted	OO
to	OO
give	OO
back	OO
to	OO
ghana	,U
but	OO
they're	OO
afraid	OO
that	OO
if	OO
they	OO
go	OO
home	,O
nobody	OO
will	OO
take	OO
them	OO
seriously	OO
as	OO
real	OO
africans	.U
i	OU
had	OO
students	OO
who	OO
said	OO
they	OO
had	OO
families	,O
wives	,O
children	,O
husbands	,O
partners	OO
to	OO
take	OO
care	OO
of	,O
perhaps	OO
they	OO
were	OO
better	OO
off	OO
staying	OO
in	OO
the	OO
united	OU
states	OU
and	OO
providing	OO
for	OO
their	OO
families	OO
back	OO
home	OO
rather	OO
than	OO
going	OO
back	OO
and	OO
getting	OO
into	OO
public	OO
service	.O
this	OU
got	OO
me	OO
thinking	OO
about	OO
the	OO
question	OO
of	OO
skills	OO
remittance	,O
of	OO
talent	OO
remittance	,O
of	OO
social	OO
and	OO
political	OO
remittance	.O
if	OU
these	OO
young	OO
people	OO
have	OO
the	OO
passion	OO
to	OO
give	OO
back	OO
to	OO
their	OO
communities	OO
monetarily	,O
imagine	OO
how	OO
different	OO
our	OO
politics	OO
would	OO
be	OO
if	OO
those	OO
same	OO
skills	,O
influence	,O
leadership	,O

were	OO
put	OO
at	OO
work	OO
in	OO
service	OO
of	OO
the	OO
public	OO
good	.O
and	OU
that	OO
includes	OO
all	OO
of	OO
you	OO
in	OO
this	OO
room	OO
because	OO
many	OO
of	OO
you	OO
are	OO
also	OO

the	OO

i'm	OU
here	OO
to	OO

you	.O
i'm	OU

a	OO

with	OO
you	.O
i'm	OU
not	OO
going	OO
back	OO
unless	OO
i	OU
take	OO
you	OO
with	OO
me	.O
now	,U
i	OU
know	OO
that	OO
most	OO
of	OO
you	,O
if	OO
not	OO
the	OO
vast	OO
majority	OO
of	OO
you	,O
are	OO
completely	OO
fed	OO
up	,O
turned	OO
off	,O
discouraged	,O
disgusted	OO
by	OO

either	OO
in	OO
your	OO
country	,O
in	OO
this	OO
country	,O
all	OO
over	OO
the	OO

perhaps	OU
you	OO
are	OO
discouraged	OO
by	OO
the	OO
fact	OO
that	OO
governments	OO
are	OO
slow	OO
to	OO
deliver	.O
perhaps	OU
they're	OO
inefficient	.O
perhaps	OU
they	OO
are	OO
thoroughly	OO
corrupt	OO
and	OO
rotten	OO
to	OO
the	OO
core	.O
perhaps	OU
they're	OO
responsible	OO
for	OO
conflicts	OO
that	OO
have	OO
claimed	OO
lives	OO
and	OO
livelihoods	OO
in	OO
the	OO
countries	OO
from	OO
which	OO
you	OO

so	OU
why	OO
would	OO
you	OO
sink	OO
your	OO
time	OO
and	OO
your	OO
energies	OO
into	OO
such	OO
a	OO
compromised	OO
system	?O
one	OU
of	OO
the	OO

of	OO

inefficiency	,O
corruption	,O
stagnation	OO
which	OO
i've	OU
encountered	OO
in	OO

is	OO
the	OO
question	OO
of	OO
a	OO
political	OO

there	OU
is	OO
a	OO
reason	OO
that	OO
our	OO

are	OO
not	OO
performing	OO
as	OO
they	OO
should	.O
it's	OU
not	OO

going	,O
that	OO
would	OO
lead	OO
them	OO
back	OO
to	OO
the	OO
start	,O
so	OO
this	OO
is	OO
a	OO
loop	.O
for	OU
example	,O
if	OO
the	OO
boxes	OO
are	OO
arranged	OO
like	OO
so	,O
the	OO
singer	OO
would	OO
open	OO
the	OO
first	OO
box	OO
to	OO
find	OO
the	OO
drums	,O
go	OO
to	OO
the	OO
eighth	OO
box	OO
to	OO
find	OO
the	OO
bass	,O
and	OO
find	OO
her	OO
microphone	OO
in	OO
the	OO
third	OO
box	,O
which	OO
would	OO
point	OO
back	OO
to	OO
the	OO
first	.O
this	OU
works	OO
much	OO
better	OO
than	OO
random	OO
guessing	OO
because	OO
by	OO
starting	OO
with	OO
the	OO
box	OO
with	OO
the	OO
picture	OO
of	OO
their	OO
instrument	,O
each	OO
musician	OO
restricts	OO
their	OO
search	OO
to	OO
the	OO
loop	OO
that	OO
contains	OO
their	OO
instrument	,O
and	OO
there	OO
are	OO
decent	OO
odds	,O
about	OO
35%	,O
that	OO
all	OO
of	OO
the	OO
loops	OO
will	OO
be	OO
of	OO
length	OO
five	OO
or	OO
less	.O
how	OU
do	OO
we	OO
calculate	OO
those	OO
odds	?O
for	OU
the	OO
sake	OO
of	OO
simplicity	,O
we'll	OO
demonstrate	OO
with	OO
a	OO
simplified	OO
case	,O
four	OO
instruments	OO
and	OO
no	OO
more	OO
than	OO
two	OO
guesses	OO
allowed	OO
for	OO
each	OO
musician	.O
let's	OU
start	OO
by	OO
finding	OO
the	OO
odds	OO
of	OO
failure	,O
the	OO
chance	OO
that	OO
someone	OO
will	OO
need	OO
to	OO
open	OO
three	OO
or	OO
four	OO
boxes	OO
before	OO
they	OO
find	OO
their	OO
instrument	.O
there	OU
are	OO
six	OO
distinct	OO
four	OO
box	OO
loops	.O
one	OU
fun	OO
way	OO
to	OO
count	OO
them	OO
is	OO
to	OO
make	OO
a	OO
square	,O
put	OO
an	OO
instrument	OO
at	OO
each	OO
corner	,O
and	OO
draw	OO
the	OO
diagonals	.O
see	OU
how	OO
many	OO
unique	OO
loops	OO
you	OO
can	OO
find	,O
and	OO
keep	OO
in	OO
mind	OO
that	OO
these	OO
two	OO
are	OO
considered	OO
the	OO
same	,O
they	OO
just	OO
start	OO
at	OO
different	OO
points	.O
these	OU
two	,O
however	,O
are	OO
different	.O
we	OU
can	OO
visualize	OO
the	OO
eight	OO
distinct	OO
three	OO
box	OO
loops	OO
using	OO
triangles	.O
you'll	OU
find	OO
four	OO
possible	OO
triangles	OO
depending	OO
on	OO
which	OO
instrument	OO
you	OO
leave	OO
out	,O
and	OO
two	OO
distinct	OO
paths	OO
on	OO
each	.O
so	OU
of	OO
the	OO
24	OO
possible	OO
combinations	OO
of	OO
boxes	,O
there	OO
are	OO
14	OO
that	OO
lead	OO
to	OO
faliure	,O
and	OO
ten	OO
that	OO
result	OO
in	OO
success	.O
that	OU
computational	OO
strategy	OO
works	OO
for	OO
any	OO
even	OO
number	OO
of	OO
musicians	,O
but	OO
if	OO
you	OO
want	OO
a	OO
shortcut	,O
it	OO
generalizes	OO
to	OO
a	OO
handy	OO
equation	.O
plug	OU
in	OO
ten	OO
musicians	,O
and	OO
we	OO
get	OO
odds	OO
of	OO
about	OO
35%	.O
what	OU
if	OO
there	OO
were	OO
1,000	OO
musicians	?O
1,000,000	?O
as	OU
n	OO
increases	,O
the	OO
odds	OO
approach	OO
about	OO
30%	.O
not	OU
a	OO
guarantee	,O
but	OO
with	OO
a	OO
bit	OO
of	OO
musician's	OO
luck	,O
it's	OO
far	OO
from	OO
hopeless	.O
hi	OU
everybody	,O
if	OO
you	OO
liked	OO
this	OO

try	OO
solving	OO
these	OO
two	.O
bryn	OU
freedman:	OU
you're	OU
a	OO
guy	OO
whose	OO
company	OO
funds	OO
these	OO
ai	OU
programs	OO
and	OO
invests	.O
so	OU
why	OO
should	OO
we	OO
trust	OO
you	OO
to	OO
not	OO
have	OO
a	OO
bias	OO
and	OO
tell	OO
us	OO
something	OO
really	OO
useful	OO
for	OO
the	OO
rest	OO
of	OO
us	OO
about	OO
the	OO
future	OO
of	OO
work	?O
roy	OU
bahat:	OU
yes	,U
i	OU
am	.O
and	OU
when	OO
you	OO
wake	OO
up	OO
in	OO
the	OO
morning	OO
and	OO
you	OO
read	OO
the	OO
newspaper	OO
and	OO
it	OO
says	,O
the	OU
robots	OO
are	OO
coming	,O
they	OO
may	OO
take	OO
all	OO
our	OO
jobs	,O
as	OO
a	OO
start	OO
up	OO
investor	OO
focused	OO
on	OO
the	OO
future	OO
of	OO
work	,O
our	OO
fund	OO
was	OO
the	OO
first	OO
one	OO
to	OO
say	OO
artificial	OO
intelligence	OO
should	OO
be	OO
a	OO
focus	OO
for	OO
us	.O
so	OU
i	OU
woke	OO
up	OO
one	OO
morning	OO
and	OO
read	OO
that	OO
and	OO
said	,O
oh	,U
my	OO
gosh	,O
they're	OO
talking	OO
about	OO
me	.O
that's	OU
me	OO
who's	OO
doing	OO
that	.O
and	OU
then	OO
i	OU
thought:	OO
wait	OO
a	OO
minute	.O
if	OU
things	OO
continue	,O
then	OO
maybe	OO
not	OO
only	OO
will	OO
the	OO
start	OO
ups	OO
in	OO
which	OO
we	OO
invest	OO
struggle	OO
because	OO
there	OO
won't	OO
be	OO
people	OO
to	OO
have	OO
jobs	OO
to	OO
pay	OO
for	OO
the	OO
things	OO
that	OO
they	OO
make	OO
and	OO
buy	OO
them	,O
but	OO
our	OO
economy	OO
and	OO
society	OO
might	OO
struggle	,O
too	.O
and	OU
look	,O
i	OU
should	OO
be	OO
the	OO
guy	OO
who	OO
sits	OO
here	OO
and	OO
tells	OO
you	,O
everything	OU
is	OO
going	OO
to	OO
be	OO
fine	.O
it's	OU
all	OO
going	OO
to	OO
work	OO
out	OO
great	.O
hey	,U
when	OO
they	OO
introduced	OO
the	OO
atm	OU
machine	,O
years	OO
later	,O
there's	OO
more	OO
tellers	OO
in	OO
banks	.O
it's	OU
true	.O
and	OU
yet	,O
when	OO
i	OU
looked	OO
at	OO
it	,O
i	OU
thought	,O
this	OU
is	OO
going	OO
to	OO
accelerate	.O
and	OU
if	OO
it	OO
does	OO
accelerate	,O
there's	OO
a	OO
chance	OO
the	OO
center	OO
doesn't	OO
hold	.O
but	OU
i	OU
figured	OO
somebody	OO
must	OO
know	OO
the	OO
answer	OO
to	OO
this;	OO
there	OO
are	OO
so	OO
many	OO
ideas	OO
out	OO
there	.O
and	OU
i	OU
read	OO
all	OO
the	OO
books	,O
and	OO
i	OU
went	OO
to	OO
the	OO
conferences	,O
and	OO
at	OO
one	OO
point	,O
we	OO
counted	OO
more	OO
than	OO
100	OO
efforts	OO
to	OO
study	OO
the	OO
future	OO
of	OO
work	.O
and	OU
it	OO
was	OO
a	OO
frustrating	OO
experience	,O
because	OO
i'd	OU
hear	OO
the	OO
same	OO
back	OO
and	OO
forth	OO
over	OO
and	OO
over	OO
again:	OO
the	OU
robots	OO
are	OO
coming	.O
and	OU
then	OO
somebody	OO
else	OO
would	OO
say	,O
oh	,U
don't	OO
worry	OO
about	OO
that	,O
they've	OO
always	OO
said	OO
that	OO
and	OO
it	OO
turns	OO
out	OO
ok	.U
then	OU
somebody	OO
else	OO
would	OO
say	,O
well	,U
it's	OO
really	OO
about	OO
the	OO
meaning	OO
of	OO
your	OO
job	,O
anyway	.O
and	OU
then	OO
everybody	OO
would	OO
shrug	OO
and	OO
go	OO
off	OO
and	OO
have	OO
a	OO
drink	.O
and	OU
it	OO
felt	OO
like	OO
there	OO
was	OO
this	OO
kabuki	OU
theater	OO
of	OO
this	OO
discussion	,O
where	OO
nobody	OO
was	OO
talking	OO
to	OO
each	OO
other	.O
and	OU
many	OO
of	OO
the	OO
people	OO
that	OO
i	OU
knew	OO
and	OO
worked	OO
with	OO
in	OO
the	OO
technology	OO
world	OO
were	OO
not	OO
speaking	OO
to	OO
policy	OO
makers;	OO
the	OO
policy	OO
makers	OO
were	OO
not	OO
speaking	OO
to	OO
them	.O
and	OU
so	OO
we	OO
partnered	OO
with	OO
a	OO
nonpartisan	OO
think	OO
tank	OO
ngo	OU
called	OO
new	OU
america	OU
to	OO
study	OO
this	OO
issue	.O
and	OU
we	OO
brought	OO
together	OO
a	OO
group	OO
of	OO
people	,O
including	OO
an	OO
ai	OU
czar	OO
at	OO
a	OO
technology	OO
company	OO
and	OO
a	OO
video	OO
game	OO
designer	OO
and	OO
a	OO
heartland	OO
conservative	OO
and	OO
a	OO
wall	OU
street	OU
investor	OO
and	OO
a	OO
socialist	OO
magazine	OO
editor	OO
—	OO
literally	,O
all	OO
in	OO
the	OO
same	OO
room;	OO
it	OO
was	OO
occasionally	OO
awkward	OO
—	OO
to	OO
try	OO
to	OO
figure	OO
out	OO
what	OO
is	OO
it	OO
that	OO
will	OO
happen	OO
here	.O
the	OU
question	OO
we	OO
asked	OO
was	OO
simple	.O
it	OU
was:	OO
what	OU
is	OO
the	OO
effect	OO
of	OO
technology	OO
on	OO
work	OO
going	OO
to	OO
be	?O
and	OU
we	OO
looked	OO
out	OO
10	OO
to	OO
20	OO
years	,O
because	OO
we	OO
wanted	OO
to	OO
look	OO
out	OO
far	OO
enough	OO
that	OO
there	OO
could	OO
be	OO
real	OO
change	,O
but	OO
soon	OO
enough	OO
that	OO
we	OO
weren't	OO
talking	OO
about	OO
teleportation	OO
or	OO
anything	OO
like	OO
that	.O
and	OU
we	OO
recognized	OO
—	OO
and	OO
i	OU
think	OO
every	OO
year	OO
we're	OO
reminded	OO
of	OO
this	OO
in	OO
the	OO
world	OO
—	OO
that	OO
predicting	OO
what's	OO
going	OO
to	OO
happen	OO
is	OO
hard	.O
so	OU
instead	OO
of	OO
predicting	,O
there	OO
are	OO
other	OO
things	OO
you	OO
can	OO
do	.O
you	OU
can	OO
try	OO
to	OO
imagine	OO
alternate	OO
possible	OO
futures	,O
which	OO
is	OO
what	OO
we	OO
did	.O
we	OU
did	OO
a	OO
scenario	OO
planning	OO
exercise	,O
and	OO
we	OO
imagined	OO
cases	OO
where	OO
no	OO
job	OO
is	OO
safe	.O
we	OU
imagined	OO
cases	OO
where	OO
every	OO
job	OO
is	OO
safe	.O
and	OU
we	OO
imagined	OO
every	OO
distinct	OO
possibility	OO
we	OO
could	.O
and	OU
the	OO
result	,O
which	OO
really	OO
surprised	OO
us	,O
was	OO
when	OO
you	OO
think	OO
through	OO
those	OO
futures	OO
and	OO
you	OO
think	OO
what	OO
should	OO
we	OO
do	,O
the	OO
answers	OO
about	OO
what	OO
we	OO
should	OO
do	OO
actually	OO
turn	OO
out	OO
to	OO
be	OO
the	OO
same	,O
no	OO
matter	OO
what	OO
happens	.O
and	OU
the	OO
irony	OO
of	OO
looking	OO
out	OO
10	OO
to	OO
20	OO
years	OO
into	OO
the	OO
future	OO
is	,O
you	OO
realize	OO
that	OO
the	OO
things	OO
we	OO
want	OO
to	OO
act	OO
on	OO
are	OO
actually	OO
already	OO
happening	OO
right	OO
now	.O
the	OU
automation	OO
is	OO
right	OO
now	,O
the	OO
future	OO
is	OO
right	OO
now	.O
bf:	OU
so	OU
what	OO
does	OO
that	OO
mean	,O
and	OO
what	OO
does	OO
that	OO
tell	OO
us	?O
if	OU
the	OO
future	OO
is	OO
now	,O
what	OO
is	OO
it	OO
that	OO
we	OO
should	OO
be	OO
doing	,O
and	OO
what	OO
should	OO
we	OO
be	OO
thinking	OO
about	?O
rb:	OU
we	OU
have	OO
to	OO
understand	OO
the	OO
problem	OO
first	.O
and	OU
so	OO
the	OO
data	OO
are	OO
that	OO
as	OO
the	OO
economy	OO
becomes	OO
more	OO
productive	OO
and	OO
individual	OO
workers	OO
become	OO
more	OO
productive	,O
their	OO
wages	OO
haven't	OO
risen	.O
if	OU
you	OO
look	OO
at	OO
the	OO
proportion	OO
of	OO
prime	OO
working	OO
age	OO
men	,O
in	OO
the	OO
united	OU
states	OU
at	OO
least	,O
who	OO
work	OO
now	OO
versus	OO
in	OO
1960	,O
we	OO
have	OO
three	OO
times	OO
as	OO
many	OO
men	OO
not	OO
working	.O
and	OU
then	OO
you	OO
hear	OO
the	OO
stories	.O
i	OU
sat	OO
down	OO
with	OO
a	OO
group	OO
of	OO
walmart	OU
workers	OO
and	OO
said	,O
what	OU
do	OO
you	OO
think	OO
about	OO
this	OO
cashier	,O
this	OO
futuristic	OO
self	OO
checkout	OO
thing	?O
they	OU
said	,O
that's	OU
nice	,O
but	OO
have	OO
you	OO
heard	OO
about	OO
the	OO
cash	OO
recycler	?O
that's	OU
a	OO
machine	OO
that's	OO
being	OO
installed	OO
right	OO
now	,O
and	OO
is	OO
eliminating	OO
two	OO
jobs	OO
at	OO
every	OO
walmart	OU
right	OO
now	.O
and	OU
so	OO
we	OO
just	OO
thought	,O
geez	.U
we	OU
don't	OO
understand	OO
the	OO
problem	.O
and	OU
so	OO
we	OO
looked	OO
at	OO
the	OO
voices	OO
that	OO
were	OO
the	OO
ones	OO
that	OO
were	OO
excluded	,O
which	OO
is	OO
all	OO
of	OO
the	OO
people	OO
affected	OO
by	OO
this	OO
change	.O
and	OU
we	OO
decided	OO
to	OO
listen	OO
to	OO
them	,O
sort	OO
of	OO
automation	OO
and	OO
its	OO
discontents	.O
and	OU
i've	OU
spent	OO
the	OO
last	OO
couple	OO
of	OO
years	OO
doing	OO
that	.O
i've	OU
been	OO
to	OO
flint	,U
michigan	,U
and	OO
youngstown	,U
ohio	,U
talking	OO
about	OO
entrepreneurs	,O
trying	OO
to	OO
make	OO
it	OO
work	OO
in	OO
a	OO
very	OO
different	OO
environment	OO
from	OO
new	OU
york	OU
or	OO
san	OU
francisco	OU
or	OO
london	OU
or	OO
tokyo	.U
i've	OU
been	OO
to	OO
prisons	OO
twice	OO
to	OO
talk	OO
to	OO
inmates	OO
about	OO
their	OO
jobs	OO
after	OO
they	OO
leave	.O
i've	OU
sat	OO
down	OO
with	OO
truck	OO
drivers	OO
to	OO
ask	OO
them	OO
about	OO
the	OO
self	OO
driving	OO
truck	,O
with	OO
people	OO
who	,O
in	OO
addition	OO
to	OO
their	OO
full	OO
time	OO
job	,O
care	OO
for	OO
an	OO
aging	OO
relative	.O
and	OU
when	OO
you	OO
talk	OO
to	OO
people	,O
there	OO
were	OO
two	OO
themes	OO
that	OO
came	OO
out	OO
loud	OO
and	OO
clear	.O
the	OU
first	OO
one	OO
was	OO
that	OO
people	OO
are	OO
less	OO
looking	OO
for	OO
more	OO
money	OO
or	OO
get	OO
out	OO
of	OO
the	OO
fear	OO
of	OO
the	OO
robot	OO
taking	OO
their	OO
job	,O
and	OO
they	OO
just	OO
want	OO
something	OO
stable	.O
they	OU
want	OO
something	OO
predictable	.O
so	OU
if	OO
you	OO
survey	OO
people	OO
and	OO
ask	OO
them	OO
what	OO
they	OO
want	OO
out	OO
of	OO
work	,O
for	OO
everybody	OO
who	OO
makes	OO
less	OO
than	OO
150,000	OO
dollars	OO
a	OO
year	,O
they'll	OO
take	OO
a	OO
more	OO
stable	OO
and	OO
secure	OO
income	,O
on	OO
average	,O
over	OO
earning	OO
more	OO
money	.O
and	OU
if	OO
you	OO
think	OO
about	OO
the	OO
fact	OO
that	OO
not	OO
only	OO
for	OO
all	OO
of	OO
the	OO
people	OO
across	OO
the	OO
earth	OO
who	OO
don't	OO
earn	OO
a	OO
living	,O
but	OO
for	OO
those	OO
who	OO
do	,O
the	OO
vast	OO
majority	OO
earn	OO
a	OO
different	OO
amount	OO
from	OO
month	OO
to	OO
month	OO
and	OO
have	OO
an	OO
instability	,O
all	OO
of	OO
a	OO
sudden	OO
you	OO
realize	,O
wait	OU
a	OO
minute	.O
we	OU
have	OO
a	OO
real	OO
problem	OO
on	OO
our	OO
hands	.O
and	OU
the	OO
second	OO
thing	OO
they	OO
say	,O
which	OO
took	OO
us	OO
a	OO
longer	OO
time	OO
to	OO
understand	,O
is	OO
they	OO
say	OO
they	OO
want	OO
dignity	.O
and	OU
that	OO
concept	OO
of	OO
self	OO
worth	OO
through	OO
work	OO
emerged	OO
again	OO
and	OO
again	OO
and	OO
again	OO
in	OO
our	OO
conversations	.O
bf:	OU
so	,U
i	OU
certainly	OO
appreciate	OO
this	OO
answer	.O
but	OU
you	OO
can't	OO
eat	OO
dignity	,O
you	OO
can't	OO
clothe	OO
your	OO
children	OO
with	OO
self	OO
esteem	.O
so	,U
what	OO
is	OO
that	,O
how	OO
do	OO
you	OO
reconcile	OO
—	OO
what	OO
does	OO
dignity	OO
mean	,O
and	OO
what	OO
is	OO
the	OO
relationship	OO
between	OO
dignity	OO
and	OO
stability	?O
rb:	OU
you	OU
can't	OO
eat	OO
dignity	.O
you	OU
need	OO
stability	OO
first	.O
and	OU
the	OO
good	OO
news	OO
is	,O
many	OO
of	OO
the	OO

those	OU

we're	OO
at	OO
a	OO
time	OO
where	OO
we	OO
must	OO
figure	OO
that	OO
out	.O
it	OU

the	OO
crisis	OO
of	OO
our	OO

and	OU
my	OO
point	OO
of	OO
view	OO
after	OO
talking	OO
to	OO
people	OO
is	OO
that	OO
we	OO
may	OO
do	OO
that	,O
and	OO
it	OO
still	OO
might	OO
not	OO
be	OO
enough	.O
because	OU
what	OO
we	OO
need	OO
to	OO
do	OO
from	OO
the	OO
beginning	OO
is	OO
understand	OO
what	OO
is	OO
it	OO
about	OO
work	OO
that	OO
gives	OO
people	OO
dignity	,O
so	OO
they	OO
can	OO
live	OO
the	OO
lives	OO
that	OO
they	OO
want	OO
to	OO
live	.O
and	OU
so	OO
that	OO
concept	OO
of	OO
dignity	OO
is	.O
it's	OO
difficult	OO
to	OO
get	OO
your	OO
hands	OO
around	,O
because	OO
when	OO
many	OO
people	OO
hear	OO
it	OO
—	OO
especially	,O
to	OO
be	OO
honest	,O
rich	OO
people	OO

they	OO
hear	OO
meaning	.O
they	OU
hear	OO
my	OU
work	OO
is	OO
important	OO
to	OO
me	.O
and	OU
again	,O
if	OO
you	OO
survey	OO
people	OO
and	OO
you	OO
ask	OO
them	,O
how	OU
important	OO
is	OO
it	OO
to	OO
you	OO
that	OO
your	OO

you	?O
only	OO
people	OO
who	OO
make	OO
150,000	OO

a	OO

your	OO

whatever	OU
somebody	OO
took	OO
that	OO
to	OO

and	OU
yet	,O
of	OO
course	OO
dignity	OO
is	OO
essential	.O
we	OU
talked	OO
to	OO
truck	OO
drivers	OO
who	OO
said	,O
i	OU
saw	OO
my	OO
cousin	OO
drive	,O
and	OO
i	OU
got	OO
on	OO
the	OO
open	OO

and	OO
it	OO
was	OO
amazing	.O
and	OU
i	OU
started	OO
making	OO
more	OO
money	OO
than	OO
people	OO
who	OO
went	OO
to	OO
college	.O
then	OU
they'd	OO
get	OO
to	OO
the	OO
end	OO
of	OO
their	OO
thought	OO
and	OO
say	OO
something	OO
like	,O
people	OU
need	OO
their	OO
fruits	OO
and	OO
vegetables	OO
in	OO
the	OO
morning	,O
and	OO
i'm	OU
the	OO
guy	OO
who	OO
gets	OO
it	OO
to	OO
them	.O
we	OU
talked	OO
to	OO
somebody	OO
who	,O
in	OO
addition	OO
to	OO
his	OO
job	,O
was	OO
caring	OO
for	OO
his	OO
aunt	.O
he	OU
was	OO
making	OO
plenty	OO
of	OO
money	.O
at	OU
one	OO
point	OO
we	OO
just	OO
asked	,O
what	OU
is	OO
it	OO
about	OO
caring	OO
for	OO
your	OO
aunt	?O
can't	OU
you	OO
just	OO
pay	OO
somebody	OO
to	OO
do	OO
it	?O
he	OU
said	,O
my	OU
aunt	OO
doesn't	OO
want	OO
somebody	OO
we	OO
pay	OO
for	.O
my	OU
aunt	OO
wants	OO
me	.O
so	OU
there	OO
was	OO
this	OO
concept	OO
there	OO
of	OO
being	OO
needed	.O
if	OU
you	OO
study	OO
the	OO
word	OO
dignity	,O
it's	OO
fascinating	.O
it's	OU
one	OO
of	OO
the	OO
oldest	OO
words	OO
in	OO
the	OO
english	OU
language	,O
from	OO
antiquity	.O
and	OU
it	OO
has	OO
two	OO
meanings:	OO
one	OO
is	OO
self	OO
worth	,O
and	OO
the	OO
other	OO
is	OO
that	OO
something	OO
is	OO
suitable	,O
it's	OO
fitting	,O
meaning	OO
that	OO
you're	OO
part	OO
of	OO
something	OO
greater	OO
than	OO
yourself	,O
and	OO
it	OO
connects	OO
to	OO
some	OO
broader	OO
whole	.O
in	OU
other	OO
words	,O
that	OO
you're	OO
needed	.O
bf:	OU
so	OU
how	OO
do	OO
you	OO
answer	OO
this	OO
question	,O
this	OO
concept	OO
that	OO
we	OO
don't	OO
pay	OO
teachers	,O
and	OO
we	OO
don't	OO
pay	OO
eldercare	OO
workers	,O
and	OO
we	OO
don't	OO
pay	OO
people	OO
who	OO
really	OO
care	OO
for	OO
people	OO
and	OO
are	OO
needed	,O
enough	?O
rb:	OU
well	,U
the	OO
good	OO
news	OO
is	,O
people	OO
are	OO
finally	OO
asking	OO
the	OO
question	.O
so	OU
as	OO
ai	OU
investors	,O
we	OO
often	OO
get	OO
phone	OO
calls	OO
from	OO
foundations	OO
or	OO
ceos	OU
and	OO
boardrooms	OO
saying	,O
what	OU
do	OO
we	OO
do	OO
about	OO
this	?O
and	OU
they	OO
used	OO
to	OO
be	OO
asking	,O
what	OU
do	OO
we	OO
do	OO
about	OO
introducing	OO
automation	?O
and	OU
now	OO
they're	OO
asking	,O
what	OU
do	OO
we	OO
do	OO
about	OO
self	OO

and	OU
they	OO
know	OO
that	OO
the	OO

who	OO
work	OO
for	OO
them	OO
who	OO
have	OO
a	OO
spouse	OO
who	OO
cares	OO
for	OO
somebody	,O
that	OO
dignity	OO
is	OO
essential	OO
to	OO
their	OO
ability	OO
to	OO
just	OO
do	OO
their	OO
job	.O
i	OU
think	OO
there's	OO
two	OO
kinds	OO
of	OO
answers:	OO
there's	OO
the	OO
money	OO
side	OO
of	OO
just	OO
making	OO
your	OO
life	OO
work	.O
that's	OU
stability	.O
you	OU
need	OO
to	OO
eat	.O
and	OU
then	OO
you	OO
think	OO
about	OO
our	OO
culture	OO
more	OO
broadly	,O
and	OO
you	OO
ask:	OO
who	OU
do	OO
we	OO
make	OO
into	OO
heroes	?O
and	,U
you	OO
know	,O
what	OO
i	OU
want	OO
is	OO
to	OO
see	OO
the	OO
magazine	OO

that	OO
is	OO
the	OO
person	OO
who	OO
is	OO
the	OO
heroic	OO
caregiver	.O
or	OU
the	OO
netflix	OU

that	OO
dramatizes	OO
the	OO
person	OO
who	OO
makes	OO
all	OO
of	OO

we	OO

let's	OU

out	OO

people	.O
that's	OU
the	OO

that	OO
i	OU

the	OO

of	OO
the	OO

what	OO
we	OO

the	OO
experience	OO
of	OO
needing	OO
one	OO
another	OO
and	OO
being	OO

maybe	OU
that's	OO
the	OO
answer	OO
for	OO
how	OO
we	OO
all	OO
fit	OO
as	OO
a	OO
society	.O
and	OU
the	OO
thought	OO
exercise	,O
to	OO
me	,O
is:	OO
if	OO
you	OO
were	OO
to	OO
go	OO
back	OO
100	OO
years	OO
and	OO
have	OO
people	OO
—	OO
my	OO
grandparents	,O
great	OO
grandparents	,O
a	OO
tailor	,O
worked	OO
in	OO
a	OO

—	OO
they	OO
look	OO
at	OO
what	OO
all	OO
of	OO
us	OO
do	OO
for	OO
a	OO
living	OO
and	OO
say	,O
that's	OU
not	OO
work	.O
we	OU
sit	OO
there	OO

and	OO
there's	OO
no	OO
danger	OO
of	OO
getting	OO
hurt	.O
and	OU
my	OO

is	OO
that	OO
if	OO
you	OO
were	OO
to	OO

100	OO

we'll	OO

it	OO

the	OU
entire	OO
thing	OO
i'm	OU
trying	OO
to	OO
say	OO

that	OO
dignity	OO
should	OO
not	OO
just	OO
be	OO
about	OO

a	OO
job	.O
because	OU
if	OO
you	OO
say	OO
you	OO
need	OO
a	OO
job	OO
to	OO
have	OO
dignity	,O
which	OO
many	OO
people	OO
say	,O
the	OO
second	OO
you	OO

that	,O
you	OO

to	OO
all	OO
the	OO

all	OO
the	OO
teachers	OO
and	OO
all	OO
the	OO
caregivers	OO
that	OO
all	OO
of	OO
a	OO
sudden	,O
because	OO
they're	OO
not	OO
being	OO
paid	OO
for	OO
what	OO
they're	OO
doing	,O
it	OO
somehow	OO
lacks	OO
this	OO
essential	OO
human	OO
quality	.O
to	OU

that's	OO
the	OO
great	OO
puzzle	OO
of	OO

we	OO
figure	OO
out	OO
how	OO
to	OO

that	OO

up	OO
on	OO
mittens	OO
just	OO
yet	.O
so	,U
a	OO
few	OO
years	OO
ago	,O
i	OU
was	OO
beginning	OO
a	OO
new	OO
unit	OO
on	OO
race	OO
with	OO
my	OO
fourth	OO
graders	.O
and	OU
whenever	OO
we	OO
start	OO
a	OO
new	OO
unit	,O
i	OU
like	OO
to	OO
begin	OO
by	OO
having	OO
all	OO
the	OO
students	OO
list	OO
everything	OO
they	OO
know	OO
about	OO
it	,O
and	OO
then	OO
we	OO
also	OO
list	OO
questions	OO
we	OO
have	.O
and	OU
i	OU
had	OO
the	OO
type	OO
of	OO
moment	OO
that	OO
every	OO
teacher	OO
has	OO
nightmares	OO
about	.O
one	OU
of	OO
my	OO
students	OO
had	OO
just	OO
asked	OO
the	OO
question	,O
why	OU
are	OO
some	OO
people	OO
racist	?O
and	OU
another	OO
student	,O
let's	OO
call	OO
her	OO
abby	,U
had	OO
just	OO
raised	OO
her	OO
hand	OO
and	OO
volunteered:	OO
maybe	OU
some	OO
people	OO
don't	OO
like	OO
black	OO
people	OO
because	OO
their	OO
skin	OO
is	OO
the	OO
color	OO
of	OO
poop	.O
yeah	,U
i	OU
know	.O
so	,U
as	OO
if	OO
on	OO
cue	,O
my	OO
entire	OO
class	OO
exploded	.O
half	OU
of	OO
them	OO
immediately	OO
started	OO
laughing	,O
and	OO
the	OO
other	OO
half	OO
started	OO
yelling	OO
at	OO
abby	OU
and	OO
shouting	OO
things	OO
like	,O
oh	,U
my	OO
god	,U
you	OO
can't	OO
say	OO
that	,O
that's	OO
racist	.O
so	OU
just	OO
take	OO
a	OO
second	OO
to	OO
freeze	OO
this	OO
scene	OO
in	OO
your	OO
mind	.O
there's	OU
a	OO
class	OO
of	OO
nine	OO
and	OO
ten	OO
year	OO
olds	,O
and	OO
half	OO
of	OO
them	OO
are	OO
in	OO
hysterics	OO
because	OO
they	OO
think	OO
abby	OU
has	OO
said	OO
something	OO
wildly	OO
funny	,O
and	OO
the	OO
other	OO
half	OO
are	OO
yelling	OO
at	OO
her	OO
for	OO
saying	OO
something	OO
offensive	.O
and	OU
then	OO
you	OO
have	OO
abby	,U
sitting	OO
there	OO
completely	OO
bewildered	OO
because	,O
in	OO
her	OO
mind	,O
she	OO
doesn't	OO
understand	OO
the	OO
weight	OO
of	OO
what	OO
she	OO
said	OO
and	OO
why	OO
everybody	OO
is	OO
reacting	OO
this	OO
way	.O
and	OU
then	OO
you	OO
have	OO
me	,O
the	OO
teacher	,O
standing	OO
there	OO
in	OO
the	OO
corner	,O
like	,O
about	OO
to	OO
have	OO
a	OO
panic	OO
attack	.O
so	OU
as	OO
a	OO
classroom	OO
teacher	,O
i	OU
have	OO
to	OO
make	OO
split	OO
second	OO
decisions	OO
all	OO
the	OO
time	.O
and	OU
i	OU
knew	OO
i	OU
needed	OO
to	OO
react	,O
but	OO
how	?O
consider	OU
your	OO
fight	OO
or	OO
flight	OO
instincts	.O
i	OU
could	OO
fight	OO
by	OO
raising	OO
my	OO
voice	OO
and	OO
reprimanding	OO
her	OO
for	OO
her	OO
words	.O
or	OU
flight	OO
—	OO
just	OO
change	OO
the	OO
subject	OO
and	OO
quickly	OO
start	OO
reaching	OO
for	OO
another	OO
subject	,O
like	OO
anything	OO
to	OO
get	OO
my	OO
students'	OO
minds	OO
off	OO
the	OO
word	OO
poop	.O
however	,U
as	OO
we	OO
know	,O
the	OO
right	OO
thing	OO
to	OO
do	OO
is	OO
often	OO
not	OO
the	OO
easy	OO
thing	OO
to	OO
do	.O
and	OU
as	OO
much	OO
as	OO
i	OU
wanted	OO
this	OO
moment	OO
to	OO
be	OO
over	,O
and	OO
that	OO
i	OU
knew	OO
both	OO
of	OO
these	OO
options	OO
would	OO
help	OO
me	OO
escape	OO
the	OO
situation	,O
i	OU
knew	OO
that	OO
this	OO
was	OO
far	OO
too	OO
important	OO
of	OO
a	OO
teachable	OO
moment	OO
to	OO
miss	.O
so	OU
after	OO
standing	OO
there	OO
for	OO
what	OO
felt	OO
like	OO
an	OO
eternity	,O
i	OU
unfroze	OO
and	OO
i	OU
turned	OO
to	OO
face	OO
my	OO
class	,O
and	OO
i	OU
said	,O
actually	,U
abby	OU
makes	OO
a	OO
point	.O
and	OU
my	OO
students	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
looked	OO
at	OO
each	OO
other	,O
all	OO
confused	.O
and	OU
i	OU
continued	,O
one	OU
reason	OO
why	OO
racism	OO
exists	OO
is	OO
because	OO
people	OO
with	OO
light	OO
skin	OO
have	OO
looked	OO
at	OO
people	OO
with	OO
dark	OO
skin	OO
and	OO
said	OO
that	OO
their	OO
skin	OO
was	OO
ugly	.O
and	OU
even	OO
use	OO
this	OO
reason	OO
as	OO
an	OO
excuse	OO
to	OO
dehumanize	OO
them	.O
and	OU
the	OO
reason	OO
why	OO
we're	OO
learning	OO
about	OO
race	OO
and	OO
racism	OO
in	OO
the	OO
first	OO
place	OO
is	OO
to	OO
educate	OO
ourselves	OO
to	OO
know	OO
better	.O
and	OU
to	OO
understand	OO
why	OO
comments	OO
like	OO
this	OO
are	OO
hurtful	,O
and	OO
to	OO
make	OO
sure	OO
that	OO
people	OO
with	OO
dark	OO
skin	OO
are	OO
always	OO
treated	OO
with	OO
respect	OO
and	OO
kindness	.O
now	,U
this	OO
was	OO
a	OO
truly	OO
terrifying	OO
teachable	OO
moment	.O
but	OU
as	OO
we	OO
moved	OO
forward	OO
in	OO
the	OO
conversation	,O
i	OU
noticed	OO
that	OO
both	OO
abby	OU
and	OO
the	OO
rest	OO
of	OO
the	OO
kids	OO
were	OO
still	OO
willing	OO
to	OO
engage	.O
and	OU
as	OO
i	OU
watched	OO
the	OO
conversation	OO
really	OO
marinate	OO
with	OO
my	OO
students	,O
i	OU
began	OO
to	OO
wonder	OO
how	OO
many	OO
of	OO
my	OO
students	OO
have	OO
assumptions	OO
just	OO
like	OO
abby	.U
and	OU
what	OO
happens	OO
when	OO
those	OO
assumptions	OO
go	OO
unnoticed	OO
and	OO
unaddressed	,O
as	OO
they	OO
so	OO
often	OO
do	?O
but	OU
first	,O
i	OU
think	OO
it's	OO
important	OO
to	OO
take	OO
a	OO
step	OO
back	OO
and	OO
even	OO
consider	OO
what	OO
makes	OO
a	OO
topic	OO
taboo	.O
i	OU
don't	OO
remember	OO
receiving	OO
an	OO
official	OO
list	OO
of	OO
things	OO
you're	OO
not	OO
supposed	OO
to	OO
talk	OO
about	.O
but	OU
i	OU
do	OO
remember	OO
hearing	,O
over	OO
and	OO
over	,O
growing	OO
up:	OO
there	OO
are	OO
two	OO
things	OO
you	OO
do	OO
not	OO
talk	OO
about	OO
at	OO
family	OO
get	OO
togethers	.O
and	OU
those	OO
two	OO
things	OO
are	OO
religion	OO
and	OO
politics	.O
and	OU
i	OU
always	OO
thought	OO
this	OO
was	OO
very	OO
curious	OO
because	OO
religion	OO
and	OO
politics	OO
often	OO
are	OO
such	OO
huge	OO
influencing	OO
factors	OO
over	OO
so	OO
many	OO
of	OO
our	OO
identities	OO
and	OO
beliefs	.O
but	OU
what	OO
makes	OO
a	OO
topic	OO
taboo	OO
is	OO
that	OO
feeling	OO
of	OO
discomfort	OO
that	OO
arises	OO
when	OO
these	OO
things	OO
come	OO
up	OO
in	OO
conversation	.O
but	OU
some	OO
people	OO
are	OO
extremely	OO
fluent	OO
in	OO
the	OO
language	OO
of	OO
equity	,O
while	OO
other	OO
people	OO
fear	OO
being	OO
pc	OU
shamed	OO
or	OO
that	OO
their	OO
ignorance	OO
will	OO
show	OO
as	OO
soon	OO
as	OO
they	OO
open	OO
their	OO
mouths	.O
but	OU
i	OU
believe	OO
that	OO
the	OO
first	OO
step	OO
towards	OO
holding	OO
conversations	OO
about	OO
things	OO
like	OO
equity	OO
is	OO
to	OO
begin	OO
by	OO
building	OO
a	OO
common	OO
language	.O
and	OU
that	OO
actually	OO
starts	OO
with	OO
destigmatizing	OO
topics	OO
that	OO
are	OO
typically	OO
deemed	OO
taboo	.O
now	,U
conversations	OO
around	OO
race	,O
for	OO
example	,O
have	OO
their	OO
own	OO
specific	OO
language	OO
and	OO
students	OO
need	OO
to	OO
be	OO
fluent	OO
in	OO
this	OO
language	OO
in	OO
order	OO
to	OO
have	OO
these	OO
conversations	.O
now	,U
schools	OO
are	OO
often	OO
the	OO
only	OO
place	OO
where	OO
students	OO
can	OO
feel	OO
free	OO
and	OO
comfortable	OO
to	OO
ask	OO
questions	OO
and	OO
make	OO
mistakes	.O
but	,U
unfortunately	,O
not	OO
all	OO
students	OO
feel	OO
that	OO
sense	OO
of	OO
security	.O
now	,U
i	OU
knew	OO
that	OO
day	OO
in	OO
front	OO
of	OO
my	OO
fourth	OO
graders	OO
that	OO
how	OO
i	OU
chose	OO
to	OO
respond	OO
could	OO
actually	OO
have	OO
life	OO
long	OO
implications	OO
not	OO
only	OO
for	OO
abby	,U
but	OO
for	OO
the	OO
rest	OO
of	OO
the	OO
students	OO
in	OO
my	OO
class	.O
if	OU
i	OU
had	OO
brushed	OO
her	OO
words	OO
aside	,O
the	OO
rest	OO
of	OO
the	OO
class	OO
could	OO
actually	OO
infer	OO
that	OO
this	OO
type	OO
of	OO
comment	OO
is	OO
acceptable	.O
but	OU
if	OO
i	OU
had	OO
yelled	OO
at	OO
abby	OU
and	OO
embarrassed	OO
her	OO
in	OO
front	OO
of	OO
all	OO
of	OO
her	OO
friends	,O
that	OO
feeling	OO
of	OO
shame	OO
associated	OO
with	OO
one	OO
of	OO
her	OO
first	OO
conversations	OO
on	OO
race	OO
could	OO
actually	OO
prevent	OO
her	OO
from	OO
ever	OO
engaging	OO
on	OO
that	OO
topic	OO
again	.O
now	,U
teaching	OO
kids	OO
about	OO
equity	OO
in	OO
schools	OO
is	OO
not	OO
teaching	OO
them	OO
what	OO
to	OO
think	.O
it	OU
is	OO
about	OO
giving	OO
them	OO
the	OO
tools	OO
and	OO
strategies	OO
and	OO
language	OO
and	OO
opportunities	OO
to	OO
practice	OO
how	OO
to	OO
think	.O
for	OU
example	,O
think	OO
about	OO
how	OO
we	OO
teach	OO
kids	OO
how	OO
to	OO
read	.O
we	OU
don't	OO
start	OO
by	OO
giving	OO
them	OO
books	.O
we	OU
start	OO
by	OO
breaking	OO
down	OO
words	OO
into	OO
letters	OO
and	OO
sounds	OO
and	OO
we	OO
encourage	OO
them	OO
to	OO
practice	OO
their	OO
fluency	OO
by	OO
reading	OO
every	OO
single	OO
day	,O
with	OO
a	OO
partner	OO
or	OO
with	OO
their	OO
friends	.O
and	OU
we	OO
give	OO
them	OO
lots	OO
of	OO
comprehension	OO
questions	OO
to	OO
make	OO
sure	OO
that	OO
they're	OO
understanding	OO
what	OO
they're	OO
reading	.O
and	OU
i	OU
believe	OO
that	OO
teaching	OO
kids	OO
about	OO
equity	OO
should	OO
be	OO
approached	OO
in	OO
the	OO
exact	OO
same	OO
way	.O
i	OU
like	OO
to	OO
start	OO
by	OO
giving	OO
my	OO
students	OO
a	OO
survey	OO
every	OO
year	,O
about	OO
different	OO
issues	OO
around	OO
equity	OO
and	OO
inclusion	.O
and	OU
this	OO
is	OO
a	OO
sample	OO
survey	OO
from	OO
one	OO
of	OO
my	OO
kids	,O
and	OO
as	OO
you	OO
can	OO
see	,O
there's	OO
some	OO
humor	OO
in	OO
here	.O
for	OU
under	OO
the	OO
question	,O
what	OU
is	OO
race	?O
she	OO
has	OO
written	,O
when	OU
two	OO
or	OO
more	OO
cars	,O
people	OO
and	OO
animals	OO
run	OO
to	OO
see	OO
who	OO
is	OO
fastest	OO
and	OO
who	OO
wins	.O
however	,U
if	OO
you	OO
look	OO
at	OO
her	OO
question	,O
what	OU
is	OO
racism	?O
it	OO
says	,O
when	OU
somebody	OO
says	OO
or	OO
calls	OO
someone	OO
dark	OO
skinned	OO
a	OO
mean	OO
name	.O
so	,U
she's	OO
young	,O
but	OO
she's	OO
showing	OO
that	OO
she's	OO
beginning	OO
to	OO
understand	.O
and	OU
when	OO
we	OO
act	OO
like	OO
our	OO
students	OO
aren't	OO
capable	OO
of	OO
having	OO
these	OO
conversations	,O
we	OO
actually	OO
do	OO
them	OO
such	OO
a	OO
disservice	.O
now	,U
i	OU
also	OO
know	OO
that	OO
these	OO
types	OO
of	OO
conversations	OO
can	OO
seem	OO
really	,O
really	OO
intimidating	OO
with	OO
our	OO
students	,O
especially	OO
with	OO
young	OO
learners	.O
but	OU
i	OU
have	OO
taught	OO
first	OO
through	OO
fifth	OO
grades	,O
and	OO
i	OU
can	OO
tell	OO
you	,O
for	OO
example	,O
that	OO
i'm	OU
not	OO
going	OO
to	OO
walk	OO
into	OO
a	OO
first	OO
grade	OO
classroom	OO
and	OO
start	OO
talking	OO
about	OO
things	OO
like	OO
mass	OO
incarceration	.O
but	OU
even	OO
a	OO
six	OO
year	OO
old	OO
first	OO
grader	OO
can	OO
understand	OO
the	OO
difference	OO
between	OO
what	OO
is	OO
fair	OO
—	OO
people	OO
getting	OO
what	OO
they	OO
need	.O
we	OU
identified	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
these	OO
things	OO
in	OO
class	OO
together	.O
and	OU
the	OO
difference	OO
between	OO
fair	OO
and	OO
equal	OO
—	OO
when	OO
everybody	OO
gets	OO
the	OO
same	OO
thing	,O
especially	OO
goody	OO
bags	OO
at	OO
birthday	OO
parties	.O
now	,U
first	OO
graders	OO
can	OO
also	OO
understand	OO
the	OO
difference	OO
between	OO
a	OO
punishment	OO
and	OO
a	OO
consequence	.O
and	OU
all	OO
of	OO
these	OO
things	OO
are	OO
foundational	OO
concepts	OO
that	OO
anyone	OO
needs	OO
to	OO
understand	OO
before	OO
having	OO
a	OO
conversation	OO
about	OO
mass	OO
incarceration	OO
in	OO
the	OO
united	OU
states	.U
some	OU
people	OO
might	OO
think	OO
that	OO
kindergarteners	OO
or	OO
first	OO
graders	OO
are	OO
too	OO
young	OO
to	OO
have	OO
conversations	OO
around	OO
racism	,O
but	OO
also	OO
tell	OO
you	OO
that	OO
young	OO

understand	OO
that	OO
there	OO
are	OO
many	OO
different	OO
components	OO
that	OO
make	OO
up	OO
our	OO
identities	OO
and	OO
how	OO

are	OO
similar	OO

and	OO
what	OO
it	OO
means	OO
to	OO
have	OO
power	OO
when	OO
other	OO

don't	.O
when	OU
we	OO
have	OO
these	OO
conversations	OO
with	OO
students	OO
at	OO
a	OO
young	OO
age	,O
it	OO
actually	OO
takes	OO
away	OO
some	OO
of	OO
that	OO

feeling	OO
when	OO
those	OO
topics	OO
come	OO
up	OO
at	OO
a	OO
later	OO
age	.O
i	OU
also	OO
know	OO
that	OO
teaching	OO
about	OO
these	OO
things	OO
in	OO
schools	OO
can	OO
feel	OO
like	OO
navigating	OO
a	OO
minefield	.O
for	OU

what	OO
happens	OO
if	OO
parents	OO
or	OO

aren't	OO
on	OO
board	OO
with	OO

these	OO
conversations	OO
in	OO

to	OO
these	OO
people	,O
i	OU
can	OO
say:	OO
these	OO
are	OO
some	OO
examples	OO
of	OO
things	OO
that	OO
students	OO
have	OO
said	OO
to	OO
me	OO
and	OO

to	OO
my	OO

a	OO

come	OO
in	OO

to	OO
me	,O
i've	OU
heard	OO
all	OO

the	OO

i	OU
don't	OO

what	OO
it	OO
means	OO
and	OO
i'm	OU
too	OO
embarrassed	OO
to	OO
admit	OO
it	.O
i	OU
had	OO
a	OO
student	OO
come	OO
in	OO
over	OO
a	OO
weekend	OO
and	OO
come	OO
up	OO
to	OO
me	OO
and	OO

you	OU
know	,O
i	OU
just	OO
watched	OO
this	OO
movie	OO
about	OO
australia	,U
and	OO
it	OO
made	OO
me	OO
wonder	OO
if	OO

there	,O
too	.O
and	OU
i	OU
always	OO
want	OO
my	OO
students	OO
to	OO
be	OO
comfortable	OO
having	OO
these	OO
conversations	OO
because	OO
when	OO
they're	OO
comfortable	OO
talking	OO
about	OO
it	OO
and	OO
asking	OO

they	OO
also	OO

in	OO
how	OO

some	OO

it	OO

that	OO

when	OO

now	,U
a	OO
little	OO
while	OO

i	OU

a	OO
lesson	OO
about	OO

and	,U
to	OO
some	OO
people	,O
this	OO
was	OO
very	OO
exciting	OO
because	OO
i	OU
took	OO
this	OO
topic	OO
that	OO

very	OO

and	OO
i	OU
broke	OO
it	OO
down	OO
into	OO
a	OO
way	OO
that	OO
was	OO
accessible	OO
for	OO

however	,U
to	OO
other	OO
people	,O
the	OO
idea	OO
of	OO
consent	OO
is	OO
so	OO
strongly	OO
tied	OO
to	OO
sex	,O
and	OO
sex	OO
is	OO
often	OO
considered	OO
a	OO

that	OO
it	OO

them	OO
very	OO
uncomfortable	.O

my	OO

so	OO
we're	OO
not	OO
talking	OO
about	OO

in	OO

rather	,U
i	OU
wanted	OO
them	OO
to	OO
understand	OO
that	OO
everybody	OO

that	OO

them	OO
feel	OO
comfortable	.O
and	OU
the	OO

to	OO
read	OO
somebody's	OO

that	OO

her	OO

the	OO

“like	OO
a	OO

it	OO

the	OO

lady	,O

like	OO
an	OO

always	OO

so	,U
a	OO
little	OO
while	OO
ago	,O
members	OO
of	OO
my	OO
family	OO
had	OO
three	OO
bits	OO
of	OO
minor	OO
surgery	,O
about	OO
a	OO
half	OO
hour	OO
each	,O
and	OO
we	OO
got	OO
three	OO
sets	OO
of	OO
bills	.O
for	OU
the	OO
first	OO
one	,O
the	OO
anesthesia	OO
bill	OO
alone	OO
was	OO
2,000	OO

the	OO
second	OO
one	,O
2,000	OO
dollars;	OO
the	OO
third	OO
one	,O
6,000	OO
dollars	.O
so	OU
i'm	OU
a	OO
journalist	.O
i'm	OU
like	,O
what's	OO
up	OO
with	OO
that	?O
i	OU
found	OO
out	OO
that	OO
i	OU
was	OO
actually	,O
for	OO
the	OO
expensive	OO
one	,O
being	OO
charged	OO
1,419	OO
dollars	OO
for	OO
a	OO
generic	OO
anti	OO
nausea	OO
drug	OO
that	OO
i	OU
could	OO
buy	OO
online	OO
for	OO
two	OO
dollars	OO
and	OO
forty	OO
nine	OO
cents	.O
i	OU
had	OO
a	OO
long	OO
and	OO
unsatisfactory	OO
argument	OO
with	OO
the	OO
hospital	,O
the	OO
insurer	OO
and	OO
my	OO
employer	.O
everybody	OU
agreed	OO
that	OO
this	OO
was	OO
totally	OO
fine	.O
but	OU
it	OO
got	OO
me	OO
thinking	,O
and	OO
the	OO
more	OO
i	OU
talked	OO
to	OO
people	,O
the	OO
more	OO
i	OU
realized:	OO
nobody	OO
has	OO
any	OO
idea	OO
what	OO
stuff	OO
costs	OO
in	OO
health	OO
care	.O
not	OU
before	,O
during	OO
or	OO
after	OO
that	OO
procedure	OO
or	OO
test	OO
do	OO
you	OO
have	OO
any	OO
idea	OO
what	OO
it's	OO
going	OO
to	OO
cost	.O
it's	OU
only	OO
months	OO
later	OO
that	OO
you	OO
get	OO
an	OO
explanation	OO
of	OO
benefits	OO
that	OO
explains	OO
exactly	OO
nothing	.O
so	OU
this	OO
came	OO
back	OO
to	OO
me	OO
a	OO
little	OO
while	OO
later	.O
i	OU
had	OO
volunteered	OO
for	OO
a	OO

from	OO

where	OO
i	OU

20	OO
years	OO
as	OO
a	OO
journalist	.O
i	OU
was	OO
looking	OO
for	OO
my	OO
next	OO
act	.O
it	OU
turned	OO
out	OO
that	OO
next	OO
act	OO
was	OO
to	OO
build	OO
a	OO
company	OO
telling	OO
people	OO
what	OO
stuff	OO
costs	OO
in	OO
health	OO
care	.O
i	OU
won	OO
a	OO
shark	OU
tank	OU
type	OO
pitch	OO

to	OO
do	OO
just	OO
that	.O
health	OU

nobody	OO

what	OO

we	OO

we	OU

we	OU

this	OO

going	OO

us	OO
out	OO
anytime	OO

but	OU
what	OO
if	OO
the	OO
answer	OO
was	OO
really	OO
simple:	OO
make	OO
all	OO
the	OO

public	OO
all	OO
the	OO

would	OU
our	OO
individual	OO

our	OU

be	OU
really	OO
clear	OO
about	OO
this:	OO
this	OO
is	OO
a	OO
united	OU
states	OU
problem	.O
in	OU
most	OO
of	OO
the	OO
rest	OO
of	OO
the	OO
developed	OO
world	,O
sick	OO
people	OO
don't	OO
have	OO
to	OO
worry	OO
about	OO

it's	OU
also	OO
true	OO
that	OO
price	OO
transparency	OO
will	OO
not	OO
solve	OO
every	OO
problem	.O
there	OU
will	OO
still	OO
be	OO
expensive	OO
treatments	,O
huge	OO
friction	OO
from	OO
our	OO

there	OU
will	OO
still	OO
be	OO
fraud	OO
and	OO
a	OO
massive	OO
problem	OO
with	OO
overtreatment	OO
and	OO

and	OU
not	OO
everything	OO
is	OO
shoppable	.O
not	OU
everybody	OO
wants	OO
the	OO
cheapest	OO
appendectomy	OO
or	OO
the	OO

cancer	OO
care	.O
but	OU
when	OO
we	OO
talk	OO
about	OO
these	OO
clear	OO
effects	,O
we're	OO
looking	OO
at	OO
a	OO
real	OO
issue	OO
that's	OO
actually	OO
very	OO
simple	.O
when	OU
we	OO
first	OO
started	OO
calling	OO
for	OO
prices	,O
we	OO
actually	OO
felt	OO
like	OO
we	OO
were	OO
going	OO
to	OO
be	OO
arrested	.O
it	OU
seemed	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
transgressive	OO
to	OO
talk	OO
about	OO
medicine	OO
and	OO
health	OO
care	OO
in	OO
the	OO
same	OO
breath	,O
and	OO
yet	OO
it	OO
became	OO
liberating	,O
because	OO
we	OO
found	OO
not	OO
only	OO
data	OO
but	OO
also	OO
good	OO
and	OO
honest	OO
people	OO
out	OO
there	OO
in	OO
the	OO
system	OO
who	OO
want	OO
to	OO
help	OO
folks	OO
get	OO
the	OO
care	OO
they	OO
need	OO
at	OO
a	OO

they	OO
can	OO

and	OU
it	OO

to	OO

so	OU
i'll	OU
leave	OO
you	OO
with	OO
some	OO

what	OU
if	OO
we	OO
all	OO
knew	OO
what	OO

what	OU

you	OO

how	OO
much	,O
the	OO
way	OO
you	OO
do	OO
when	OO
you	OO

for	OO
a	OO

what	OU
if	OO
all	OO
of	OO
the	OO

and	OO
money	OO
that's	OO
spent	OO
hiding	OO

squeezed	OO
out	OO

the	OO

what	OU
if	OO
each	OO
one	OO
of	OO

could	OO
pick	OO
the	OO
$19	OO
test	OO
every	OO
time	OO

the	OO

would	OU
our	OO

if	OO
you	OO

you'll	OO

you	OO
might	OO

to	OO

that	OO

the	OO
right	OO
are	OO
called	OO
fatty	OO
acids	,O
and	OO
it's	OO
subtle	OO
differences	OO
in	OO
the	OO
structures	OO
of	OO
these	OO
chains	OO
that	OO
determine	OO
whether	OO
a	OO
fat	OO
is	,O
let's	OO
say	,O
solid	OO
or	OO
liquid;	OO
whether	OO
or	OO
not	OO
it	OO
goes	OO
rancid	OO
quickly;	OO
and	,O
most	OO
importantly	,O
how	OO
good	OO
or	OO
how	OO
bad	OO
it	OO
is	OO
for	OO
you	.O
let's	OU
take	OO
a	OO
look	OO
at	OO
some	OO
of	OO
these	OO
differences	.O
one	OU
is	OO
length	.O
fatty	OU
acids	OO
can	OO
be	OO
short	OO
or	OO
long	.O
another	,U
more	OO
important	OO
difference	OO
is	OO
the	OO
type	OO
of	OO
bond	OO
between	OO
the	OO
carbon	OO
atoms	.O
some	OU
fatty	OO
acids	OO
have	OO
only	OO
single	OO
bonds	.O
others	OU
have	OO
both	OO
single	OO
and	OO
double	OO
bonds	.O
fatty	OU
acids	OO
with	OO
only	OO
single	OO
bonds	OO
are	OO
called	OO
saturated	,O
and	OO
those	OO
with	OO
one	OO
or	OO
more	OO
double	OO
bonds	OO
are	OO
called	OO
unsaturated	.O
now	,U
most	OO
unsaturated	OO
fats	OO
are	OO
good	OO
for	OO
you	,O
while	OO
saturated	OO
fats	OO
are	OO
bad	OO
for	OO
you	OO
in	OO
excess	.O
for	OU
saturated	OO
fats	,O
the	OO
story	OO
pretty	OO
much	OO
ends	OO
there	OO
but	OO
not	OO
for	OO
unsaturated	OO
fats	.O
the	OU
double	OO
bonds	OO
in	OO
these	OO
molecules	OO
have	OO
a	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
weird	OO
property;	OO
they're	OO
rigid	.O
so	,U
that	OO
means	OO
there	OO
are	OO
two	OO
ways	OO
to	OO
arrange	OO
every	OO
double	OO
bond	.O
the	OU
first	OO
is	OO
like	OO
this	,O
where	OO
both	OO
hydrogens	OO
are	OO
on	OO
same	OO
side	OO
and	OO
both	OO
carbons	OO
are	OO
on	OO
the	OO
same	OO
side	.O
the	OU
second	OO
way	OO
is	OO
like	OO
this	.O
now	OU
the	OO
hydrogens	OO
and	OO
carbons	OO
are	OO
on	OO
opposite	OO
sides	OO
of	OO
the	OO
double	OO
bond	.O
now	,U
even	OO
though	OO
both	OO
of	OO
these	OO
molecules	OO
are	OO
made	OO
up	OO
of	OO
exactly	OO
the	OO
same	OO
building	OO
blocks	,O
they	OO
are	OO
two	OO
completely	OO
different	OO
substances	,O
and	OO
they	OO
behave	OO
completely	OO
differently	OO
inside	OO
of	OO
us	.O
the	OU
configuration	OO
on	OO
the	OO
left	OO
is	OO
called	OO
cis	,U
which	OO
you've	OO
probably	OO
never	OO
heard	OO
of	.O
the	OU
one	OO
of	OO
the	OO
right	OO
is	OO
called	OO
trans	,U
and	OO
you	OO
probably	OO
have	OO
heard	OO
of	OO
trans	OO
fats	OO
before	.O
they	OU
don't	OO
go	OO
rancid	,O
they're	OO
more	OO
stable	OO
during	OO
deep	OO
frying	,O
and	OO
they	OO
can	OO
change	OO
the	OO
texture	OO
of	OO
foods	OO
in	OO
ways	OO
that	OO
other	OO
fats	OO
just	OO
can't	.O
they're	OU
also	OO
terrible	OO
for	OO
your	OO
health	,O
by	OO
far	OO
worse	OO
than	OO
saturated	OO
fat	,O
even	OO
though	OO
technically	OO
they're	OO
a	OO
type	OO
of	OO
unsaturated	OO
fat	.O
now	,U
i	OU
know	OO
that	OO
seems	OO
crazy	,O
but	OO
your	OO
body	OO
doesn't	OO
care	OO
what	OO
a	OO
molecule	OO
looks	OO
like	OO
on	OO
paper	.O
all	OU
that	OO
matters	OO
is	OO
the	OO
3	OO
d	OU
shape	OO
where	OO
the	OO
molecule	OO
fits	,O
where	OO
it	OO
doesn't	,O
and	OO
what	OO
pathways	OO
it	OO
interferes	OO
with	.O
so	,U
how	OO
do	OO
you	OO
know	OO
if	OO
a	OO
food	OO
has	OO
trans	OO
fat	OO
in	OO
it	?O
well	,U
the	OO
only	OO
sure	OO
way	OO
to	OO
know	OO
is	OO
if	OO
you	OO
see	OO
the	OO
words	,O
partially	OO
hydrogenated	OO
in	OO
the	OO
ingredients	OO
list	.O
don't	OU
let	OO
nutrition	OO
labels	OO
or	OO
advertising	OO
fool	OO
you	.O
the	OU
fda	OU
allows	OO
manufacturers	OO
to	OO
claim	OO
that	OO
their	OO
products	OO
contain	OO
0	OO
grams	OO
of	OO
trans	OO
fat	OO
even	OO
if	OO
they	OO
actually	OO
have	OO
up	OO
to	OO
half	OO
a	OO
gram	OO
per	OO
serving	.O
but	OU
there	OO
are	OO
no	OO
hard	OO
and	OO
fast	OO
rules	OO
about	OO
how	OO
small	OO
a	OO
serving	OO
can	OO
be	,O
and	,O
that	OO
means	,O
you'll	OO
have	OO
to	OO
rely	OO
on	OO
seeing	OO
those	OO
key	OO
words	,O
partially	OO
hydrogenated	,O
because	OO
that's	OO
how	OO
trans	OO
fats	OO
are	OO
made	,O
by	OO
partially	OO
hydrogenating	OO
unsaturated	OO
fats	.O
so	,U
let's	OO
go	OO
back	OO
to	OO
our	OO
olive	OO

from	OO
before	.O
olive	OU
oil	OO

100%	OO

pancake	OU

only	OO
11%	OO

but	OU
olive	OO
oil	OO
is	OO
mostly	OO

and	OO
it	OO
has	OO
no	OO
trans	OO
fat	OO
at	OO
all	.O
on	OU
the	OO

more	OO

half	OO
the	OO

in	OO

is	OO
either	OO

or	OO

and	,U
so	,O
even	OO
though	OO

10	OO

as	OO

it's	OO

now	,U

just	OO
one	OO
that	OO

that	OO
in	OO

and	OO
groups	OO
of	OO

appear	OO
with	OO

the	OO
language	OO

over	OU

three	OO
main	OO
theories	OO
about	OO

text	OO

emerged	.O
the	OU
first	OO
is	OO
that	OO
it's	OO
written	OO
in	OO
cypher	,O
a	OO
secret	OO
code	OO
deliberately	OO
designed	OO
to	OO
hide	OO
secret	OO
meaning	.O
the	OU
second	OO
is	OO
that	OO
the	OO
document	OO
is	OO
a	OO
hoax	OO
written	OO
in	OO
gibberish	OO
to	OO
make	OO
money	OO
off	OO
a	OO
gullible	OO

some	OU
speculate	OO
the	OO
author	OO
was	OO
a	OO
medieval	OO
con	OO
man	.O
others	,U
that	OO
it	OO
was	OO
voynich	OU
himself	.O
the	OU
third	OO
theory	OO
is	OO
that	OO
the	OO
manuscript	OO
is	OO
written	OO
in	OO
an	OO
actual	OO
language	,O
but	OO
in	OO
an	OO
unknown	OO
script	.O
perhaps	OU
medieval	OO
scholars	OO
were	OO
attempting	OO
to	OO
create	OO
an	OO
alphabet	OO
for	OO
a	OO
language	OO
that	OO
was	OO
spoken	OO
but	OO
not	OO
yet	OO
written	.O
in	OU
that	OO
case	,O
the	OO
voynich	OU
manuscript	OO
might	OO
be	OO
like	OO
the	OO
rongorongo	OO
script	OO
invented	OO
on	OO
easter	OU
island	,U
now	OO
unreadable	OO
after	OO
the	OO

that	OO

it	OO
collapsed	.O

no	OO
one	OO
can	OO
read	OO
the	OO

that	OO
hasn't	OO
stopped	OO
people	OO
from	OO

what	OO
it	OO
might	OO

those	OU
who	OO

the	OO

was	OO
an	OO
attempt	OO
to	OO
create	OO
a	OO

there	OO

by	OO

bce	.U
but	OU
have	OO
you	OO
ever	OO
wondered	OO
how	OO
tattooing	OO
really	OO
works	?O
you	OU
may	OO
know	OO
that	OO
we	OO
shed	OO
our	OO
skin	,O
losing	OO
about	OO
30	OO
40,000	OO
skin	OO

per	OO
hour	.O
that's	OU
about	OO
1,000,000	OO
per	OO
day	.O
so	,U
how	OO
come	OO
the	OO
tattoo	OO
doesn't	OO
gradually	OO
flake	OO
off	OO
along	OO
with	OO
them	?O
the	OU
simple	OO
answer	OO
is	OO
that	OO
tattooing	OO
involves	OO
getting	OO
pigment	OO
deeper	OO
into	OO
the	OO
skin	OO
than	OO
the	OO
outermost	OO
layer	OO
that	OO
gets	OO
shed	.O
throughout	OU
history	,O
different	OO
cultures	OO
have	OO
used	OO
various	OO
methods	OO
to	OO
accomplish	OO
this	.O
but	OU
the	OO
first	OO
modern	OO
tattooing	OO
machine	OO
was	OO
modeled	OO
after	OO
thomas	OU
edison's	OU
engraving	OO
machine	OO

machines	OO
used	OO

insert	OO
tiny	OO
needles	,O

with	OO
dye	,O
into	OO
the	OO
skin	OO
at	OO
a	OO
frequency	OO
of	OO
50	OO
to	OO
3,000	OO
times	OO
per	OO
minute	.O
the	OU
needles	OO
punch	OO
through	OO
the	OO
epidermis	,O
allowing	OO
ink	OO
to	OO
seep	OO
deep	OO
into	OO
the	OO
dermis	,O
which	OO
is	OO
composed	OO
of	OO
collagen	OO
fibers	,O
nerves	,O

blood	OO

and	OO
more	.O
every	OU
time	OO
a	OO
needle	OO
penetrates	,O
it	OO
causes	OO
a	OO
wound	OO
that	OO

the	OO

the	OO

process	,O
calling	OO

to	OO
the	OO
wound	OO
site	OO
to	OO
begin	OO
repairing	OO
the	OO

and	OU
it	OO
is	OO
this	OO
very	OO
process	OO
that	OO
makes	OO
tattoos	OO
permanent	.O
first	,U
specialized	OO

called	OO

the	OO

in	OO
an	OO

to	OO
clean	OO
up	OO
the	OO

mess	.O
as	OU
these	OO

travel	OO
through	OO
the	OO

some	OO
of	OO
them	OO
are	OO
carried	OO
back	OO
with	OO
a	OO

full	OO
of	OO

into	OO
the	OO

while	OO

remain	OO
in	OO
the	OO

with	OU
no	OO
way	OO
to	OO
dispose	OO
of	OO
the	OO
pigment	,O
the	OO

inside	OO
them	OO
remain	OO
visible	OO
through	OO
the	OO

some	OU
of	OO
the	OO

are	OO
also	OO
suspended	OO
in	OO
the	OO
gel	OO
like	OO

of	OO
the	OO

while	OO
others	OO
are	OO
engulfed	OO
by	OO
dermal	OO
cells	OO
called	OO

initially	,U
ink	OO
is	OO
deposited	OO
into	OO
the	OO

as	OO
well	,O
but	OO
as	OO
the	OO
skin	OO
heals	,O
the	OO
damaged	OO

are	OO
shed	OO
and	OO
replaced	OO
by	OO

with	OO
the	OO

peeling	OO
off	OO

a	OO

or	OO
crusting	OO

not	OO
typically	OO
seen	OO
with	OO
professional	OO

and	OO
complete	OO
epidermal	OO
regeneration	OO
requires	OO
2	OO
4	OO
weeks	,O
during	OO
which	OO
excess	OO
sun	OO
exposure	OO
and	OO
swimming	OO
should	OO
be	OO
avoided	OO
to	OO
prevent	OO
fading	.O
dermal	OU
cells	,O
however	,O
remain	OO
in	OO
place	OO
until	OO
they	OO
die	.O
when	OU
they	OO
do	,O
they	OO
are	OO
taken	OO
up	,O
ink	OO
and	OO
all	,O
by	OO
younger	OO

nearby	,O
so	OO
the	OO
ink	OO
stays	OO
where	OO
it	OO
is	.O
but	OU
with	OO
time	,O
tattoos	OO
do	OO
fade	OO
naturally	OO
as	OO
the	OO
body	OO
reacts	OO
to	OO
the	OO
alien	OO
pigment	OO

slowly	OO
breaking	OO
them	OO
down	OO
to	OO
be	OO
carried	OO
off	OO
by	OO
the	OO
immune	OO

ultraviolet	OU
radiation	OO
can	OO
also	OO
contribute	OO
to	OO
this	OO
pigment	OO
breakdown	,O
though	OO
it	OO
can	OO
be	OO
mitigated	OO
by	OO
the	OO
use	OO
of	OO
sunblock	.O
but	OU
since	OO
the	OO
dermal	OO
cells	OO
are	OO
relatively	OO
stable	,O
much	OO
of	OO
the	OO
ink	OO
will	OO
remain	OO
deep	OO
in	OO
the	OO
skin	OO
for	OO
a	OO
person's	OO
whole	OO
life	.O
but	OU
if	OO
tattoos	OO
are	OO
embedded	OO
in	OO
your	OO
skin	OO
for	OO
life	,O
is	OO
there	OO
any	OO
way	OO
to	OO
erase	OO
them	?O
technically	,U
yes	.O
today	,U
a	OO
laser	OO
is	OO
used	OO
to	OO
penetrate	OO
the	OO
epidermis	OO
and	OO
blast	OO
apart	OO
underlying	OO
pigment	OO
colors	OO
of	OO
various	OO
wavelengths	,O
black	OO
being	OO
the	OO
easiest	OO
to	OO
target	.O
the	OU
laser	OO
beam	OO
breaks	OO
the	OO

globules	OO
into	OO
smaller	OO

that	OO
can	OO
then	OO
be	OO
cleared	OO
away	OO
by	OO
the	OO

but	OU
some	OO
color	OO

are	OO
harder	OO
to	OO

and	OO
there	OO
could	OO
be	OO

for	OU
this	OO
reason	,O
removing	OO
a	OO
tattoo	OO
is	OO
still	OO
more	OO

but	OO
not	OO

so	OU
a	OO

your	OO

that	OO
science	OO

be	OO
pretty	OO

i	OU
want	OO
to	OO
start	OO
out	OO
with	OO
quoting	OO
helen	OU
keller	,U
that	OO
great	OO
woman	OO
that	OO
we	OO
all	OO
admire	.O
and	OU
she	OO
had	OO
a	OO
statement	OO
that	OO
is	OO
very	OO
profound	,O
and	OO
this	OO
statement	OO
is	OO
that	OO
science	OO
has	OO
been	OO
able	OO
to	OO
find	OO
cures	OO
for	OO
many	OO
evils	,O
but	OO
never	OO
the	OO
greatest	OO
evil	OO
of	OO
all	OO
in	OO
human	OO
beings	,O
and	OO
that	OO
evil	OO
is	OO
apathy	.O
so	,U
we	OO
know	OO
that	OO
apathy	OO
really	OO
costs	OO
us	OO
a	OO
lot	,O
especially	OO
in	OO
our	OO

and	OU
when	OO
we	OO

of	OO
why	OO

not	OO
get	OO
involved	,O
why	OO
they	OO
do	OO
not	OO
become	OO
activists	,O
it's	OO
often	OO
that	OO
people	OO
are	OO
so	OO
worn	OO
down	OO
with	OO
their	OO
own	OO
familial	OO
responsibilities	,O
and	OO
women	OO

you	OU

women	,O
they	OO

in	OO
their	OO

in	OO

so	OO
it's	OO
very	OO
hard	OO
for	OO

to	OO

that	OO
they	OO

that	OU

change	OO
the	OO

another	OU

that	OO

—	OO
we	OO

that	OO

everything	.O
that	OU
we	OO
are	OO
the	OO

it	OO
is	OO
so	OO
hard	OO
for	OO

we	OO

that	OO

that	OO

that	OO

when	OO

that	OO

to	OO
leave	OO
to	OO

this	OU

a	OO

that	OO

but	OO
they	OO
can	OO
be	OO

if	OU
we	OO

they're	OO
going	OO
to	OO

that	,O
when	OO

the	OU

that	OO
we	OO
have	OO
to	OO
do	OO
to	OO

that	OO
we	OO
can	OO
do	OO
the	OO

of	OO

work	OO
that	OO
we	OO
need	OO
to	OO
do	OO
to	OO
change	OO
this	OO

we	OO
have	OO
to	OO
have	OO
a	OO
different	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
an	OO
education	OO
for	OO
our	OO
young	OO
women	.O
unfortunately	,U
in	OO
our	OO
societies	OO
around	OO
the	OO
world	,O
women	OO
are	OO
taught	OO
to	OO
be	OO
victims	.O
women	OU

not	OO

that	OO
they	OO

going	OO
to	OO

to	OO

that	OO
they're	OO
going	OO
to	OO
have	OO
to	OO
support	OO
themselves	OO
and	OO
they	OO
have	OO
to	OO
protect	OO
themselves	.O
because	,U
you	OO
know	,O
when	OO
we	OO
actually	OO
look	OO
at	OO
the	OO
animal	OO
kingdom	,O
and	OO
we	OO
see	OO
who	OO
are	OO
the	OO
most	OO
ferocious	,O
the	OO
male	OO
or	OO
the	OO
female	?O
we	OU
know	OO
it's	OO
the	OO
female	,O
right	?O
so	OU
something	OO
went	OO
wrong	OO
with	OO
us	OO
at	OO
the	OO
top	OO
of	OO
that	OO
animal	OO
kingdom	OO
as	OO

so	OU
i	OU
want	OO
to	OO
give	OO
you	OO
an	OO
example	OO
of	OO
how	OO
i	OU
found	OO
my	OO

and	OU
i	OU
was	OO
very	OO
fortunate	OO
in	OO
that	,O
when	OO
i	OU
was	OO
25	OO

old	,O
i	OU
met	OO
a	OO
gentleman	OO
named	OO
fred	OU

sr.	,U
who	OO
organized	OO
a	OO
chapter	OO
of	OO
a	OO

called	OO
the	OO

in	OO
my	OO

of	OO

california	.U
this	OU
was	OO
a	OO
grassroots	OO
organization	,O
and	OO
i	OU
was	OO
recruited	OO
to	OO
be	OO
a	OO

so	,U
one	OO
day	,O
while	OO
we	OO
were	OO
sitting	OO
in	OO
the	OO
office	,O
a	OO
farm	OO
worker	OO
comes	OO
in	.O
and	OU
he's	OO

he	OO
can	OO

he	OO
has	OO
a	OO

and	OU
he	OO

he	OU

help	OO
him	OO
go	OO
down	OO
to	OO
the	OO

and	OO
make	OO
an	OO

so	,U
i	OU
volunteered	OO
to	OO
do	OO
that	.O

when	OO

to	OO

they	OO
would	OO
not	OO

me	OO

for	OO

i	OU
didn't	OO

what	OO
to	OO

i	OU
was	OO
at	OO

so	OU
i	OU
went	OO

told	OO
mr	.U

they	OU
won't	OO

and	OU
he	OO

you	OU
go	OO
right	OO
back	OO
down	OO
to	OO
that	OO
welfare	OO
office	,O
and	OO
you	OO
demand	OO
to	OO
see	OO
a	OO
supervisor	.O
and	OU
you	OO
demand	OO
that	OO
they	OO
let	OO
him	OO
make	OO
an	OO
application	.O
and	OU
i	OU
thought	,O
wow	,U
i	OU
can	OO
do	OO
that	?O
so	OU
i	OU
thought	OO
about	OO
it	,O
and	OO
i	OU
kind	OO
of	OO
overcame	OO
my	OO
anxieties	OO
and	OO
my	OO
fears	.O
i	OU
went	OO
down	OO
to	OO
the	OO
welfare	OO
office	OO
and	OO
i	OU
demanded	OO
to	OO
see	OO
the	OO
supervisor	.O
sure	OU
enough	,O
he	OO
came	OO
out	,O
and	OO
they	OO
had	OO
to	OO
let	OO
mr	.U
ruiz	OU
make	OO
an	OO
application	OO
for	OO
welfare	.O
and	OU
he	OO
got	OO
his	OO
disability	OO
for	OO
himself	OO
and	OO
his	OO
family	.O
but	OU
that	OO
taught	OO
me	OO
a	OO
lesson	.O
that	OU
taught	OO
me	OO
that	OO
i	OU
had	OO
a	OO
voice	.O
well	,U
mr	.U
ross	OU
also	OO
taught	OO
many	OO
of	OO
us	OO
many	OO
other	OO
things	,O
including	OO
cesar	OU
chavez	OU
and	OO
many	OO
other	OO
volunteers	.O
and	OU
he	OO
taught	OO
us	OO
not	OO
only	OO
that	OO
we	OO
can	OO
make	OO
demands	OO
of	OO
people	,O
especially	OO
our	OO
public	OO
officials	.O
and	OU
this	OO
is	OO
something	OO
we	OO
should	OO
always	OO
keep	OO
in	OO
mind:	OO
every	OO
public	OO
official	OO
—	OO
guess	OO
what	OO
—	OO
they	OO
work	OO
for	OO
us	.O
because	OU
we	OO
pay	OO
their	OO
salaries	OO
with	OO
out	OO
taxes	.O
and	OU
they	OO
are	OO
actually	OO
our	OO
servants	.O
some	OU
of	OO
them	OO
turn	OO
out	OO
to	OO
be	OO
leaders	,O
but	OO
not	OO
all	OO
of	OO
them	.O
once	OU
in	OO
a	OO
while	OO
we	OO
get	OO
a	OO
leader	OO
out	OO
of	OO
there	.O
the	OU
other	OO
thing	OO
that	OO
mr	.U
ross	OU
taught	OO
us	OO
is	OO
that	OO
voting	OO
is	OO
extremely	OO
important	.O
and	OU
not	OO
just	OO
voting	,O
but	OO
going	OO
out	OO
there	OO
and	OO
getting	OO
other	OO
people	OO
to	OO
vote	.O
going	OU
door	OO
to	OO
door	.O
phone	OU
banking	,O
talking	OO
to	OO
voters	,O
because	OO
many	OO
voters	OO
have	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
doubts	OO
and	OO
they	OO
don't	OO
know	OO
how	OO
to	OO
vote	.O
and	OU
unfortunately	,O
we	OO
know	OO
that	OO
in	OO
many	OO
countries	OO
people	OO
are	OO
not	OO
allowed	OO
to	OO
vote	OO
because	OO
we	OO
have	OO
voter	OO
suppression	OO
in	OO
other	OO
countries	,O
like	OO
we	OO
do	OO
here	OO
in	OO
the	OO
united	OU
states	OU
of	OO
america	.U
but	OU
the	OO
thing	OO
is	,O
if	OO
we	OO
can	OO
get	OO
out	OO
there	OO
as	OO
individuals	OO
and	OO
talk	OO
to	OO
people	,O
so	OO
we	OO
can	OO
remove	OO
their	OO
apathy	OO
and	OO
make	OO
sure	OO
that	OO
they	OO
can	OO
vote	.O
so	,U
i	OU
want	OO
to	OO
give	OO
you	OO
an	OO
example	OO
of	OO
a	OO
woman	OO
in	OO
our	OO
foundation	,O
the	OO
dolores	OU
huerta	OU
foundation	,U
and	OO
just	OO
to	OO
show	OO
you	OO
that	OO
sometimes	OO
people	OO
have	OO
power	,O
but	OO
they	OO
don't	OO
know	OO
it	.O
but	OU
once	OO
they	OO
find	OO
it	,O
they	OO
do	OO
miraculous	OO
things	.O
so	,U
leticia	OU
prado	OU
is	OO
an	OO
immigrant	OO
from	OO
mexico	,U
only	OO
has	OO
a	OO
sixth	OO
grade	OO
education	OO
and	OO
speaks	OO
very	OO
limited	OO
english	.U
but	OU
she	OO
was	OO
very	OO
concerned	OO
because	OO
the	OO
children	OO
at	OO
the	OO
middle	OO
school	OO
in	OO
their	OO
town	OO
called	OO
weedpatch	OU
—	OO
this	OO
is	OO
in	OO
california	,U
central	OU
valley	OU
—	OO
they	OO
couldn't	OO
go	OO
out	OO
and	OO
play	OO
in	OO
the	OO
schoolyard	,O
because	OO
the	OO
air	OO
quality	OO
is	OO
so	OO
bad	OO
in	OO
the	OO
southern	OO
part	OO
of	OO
kern	OU
county	,U
california	OU
in	OO
our	OO
united	OU
states	OU
of	OO
america	.U
so	OU
she	OO
and	OO
her	OO
husband	OO
went	OO
out	OO
there	,O
and	OO
they	OO
passed	OO
a	OO
bond	OO
issue	OO
to	OO
build	OO
a	OO
brand	OO
new	,O
state	OO
of	OO
the	OO
art	OO
gymnasium	OO
for	OO
the	OO
kids	OO
at	OO
their	OO
middle	OO
school	.O
that	OU
was	OO
a	OO
big	OO
success	.O
then	OU
she	OO
heard	OO
a	OO
rumor	OO
that	OO
the	OO
principal	OO
was	OO
going	OO
to	OO
end	OO
the	OO
breakfast	OO
program	OO
for	OO
the	OO
farm	OO
worker	OO
children	,O
because	OO
the	OO
principal	OO
thought	OO
it	OO
was	OO
just	OO
too	OO
much	OO
paperwork	.O
so	,U
leticia	OU
got	OO
herself	OO
elected	OO
to	OO
the	OO
school	OO
board	.O
and	OU
they	OO
kept	OO
the	OO
breakfast	OO
program	,O
and	OO
she	OO
got	OO
rid	OO
of	OO
the	OO
principal	.O
so	OU
there	OO
were	OO
other	OO
rumors	OO
about	OO
some	OO
corruption	OO
in	OO
the	OO
local	OO
water	OO
district	.O
so	,U
leticia	OU
got	OO
herself	OO
elected	OO
to	OO
the	OO
water	OO
district	.O
then	OU
she	OO
looked	OO
into	OO
all	OO
of	OO
the	OO
finances	OO
of	OO
the	OO
water	OO
district	OO
and	OO
found	OO
there	OO
was	OO
250,000	OO
dollars	OO
missing	OO
from	OO
their	OO
bank	OO
account	.O
so	,U
leticia	OU
called	OO
in	OO
the	OO
grand	OO
jury	,O
and	OO
several	OO
arrests	OO
have	OO
been	OO
made	.O
and	OU
this	OO
is	OO
just	OO
an	OO
example	OO
of	OO
a	OO
woman	OO
who	OO
never	OO
went	OO
to	OO
high	OO
school	,O
never	OO
went	OO
to	OO
college	,O
but	OO
she	OO
found	OO
her	OO
power	.O
and	OU
in	OO
addition	,O
she	OO
has	OO
recruited	OO
other	OO
people	OO
in	OO
the	OO
community	OO
to	OO
also	OO
run	OO
for	OO
public	OO
office	,O
and	OO
guess	OO
what	OO
—	OO
they've	OO
all	OO
gotten	OO
themselves	OO
elected	.O
so	,U
i	OU
take	OO
that	OO
leticia	OU
really	OO
embodies	OO
something	OO
that	OO
coretta	OU
scott	OU
king	OU
said	.O
and	OU
i	OU
want	OO
to	OO
share	OO
this	OO
with	OO
you	.O
coretta	OU
scott	OU
king	OU
said	,O
we	OU
will	OO
never	OO
have	OO
peace	OO
in	OO
the	OO
world	OO
until	OO
women	OO
take	OO
power	.O
now	,U
i	OU
have	OO
amended	OO
that	OO
statement	OO
to	OO
say	OO
that	OO
we	OO
will	OO
never	OO
have	OO
peace	OO
in	OO
the	OO
world	OO
until	OO
feminists	OO
take	OO
power	.O
because	OU
we	OO
know	OO
there	OO
is	OO
a	OO
difference	,O
right	?O
not	OU
only	OO
that	,O
but	OO
if	OO
we	OO
want	OO
to	OO
define	OO
what	OO
is	OO
a	OO
feminist	OO
—	OO
a	OO
person	OO
who	OO
stands	OO
up	OO
for	OO
reproductive	OO
rights	,O
for	OO
immigrants'	OO
rights	,O
for	OO
the	OO
environment	,O
for	OO
lgbt	OU
rights	OO
and	OO
also	OO
for	OO
labor	OO
unions	OO
and	OO
working	OO
people	.O
which	OU
also	OO
means	OO
that	OO
men	OO
can	OO
also	OO
be	OO
feminists	.O
so	OU
when	OO
we	OO
think	OO
of	OO
feminization	,O
we	OO
should	OO
also	OO
think	OO
of	OO
how	OO
can	OO
we	OO
feminize	OO
the	OO
policies	,O
and	OO
not	OO
only	OO
of	OO
our	OO
major	OO
countries	,O
the	OO
wealthy	OO
countries	OO
like	OO
the	OO
united	OU
states	,U
but	OO
all	OO
over	OO
the	OO
world	,O
our	OO
domestic	OO
and	OO
foreign	OO
policy	.O
and	OU
one	OO
of	OO
the	OO
things	OO
that	OO
we	OO
can	OO
do	OO
to	OO
stop	OO
wars	OO
and	OO
to	OO
have	OO
peace	OO
is	OO
to	OO
make	OO
sure	OO
that	OO
the	OO
wealthiest	OO
countries	OO
in	OO
the	OO
world	OO
also	OO
help	OO
the	OO
developing	OO
countries	.O
now	,U
we	OO
did	OO
this	OO
in	OO
the	OO
past	.O
after	OU
world	OU
war	OU
ii	,U
when	OO
japan	OU
and	OO
germany	OU
were	OO
devastated	OO
after	OO
the	OO
war	,O
united	OU
states	OU
of	OO
america	OU
gave	OO
many	OO
tax	OO
dollars	OO
to	OO
those	OO
two	OO
countries	,O
so	OO
that	OO
they	OO
can	OO
rebuild	OO
their	OO
economies	OO
and	OO
rebuild	OO
their	OO
corporations	.O
and	OU
we	OO
can	OO
do	OO
that	OO
again	.O
and	OU
if	OO
we	OO
can	OO
think	OO
about	OO
how	OO
we	OO
can	OO
help	OO
these	OO
other	OO
countries	.O
and	OU
i	OU
want	OO
to	OO
give	OO
an	OO
example	OO
of	OO
issues	OO
that	OO
we	OO
are	OO
facing	OO
in	OO
the	OO
united	OU
states	OU
of	OO
america	,U
for	OO
instance	.O
we	OU
know	OO
that	OO
right	OO
now	OO
we	OO
have	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
refugees	OO
from	OO
central	OU
america	OU
that	OO
are	OO
at	OO
the	OO
border	OO
of	OO
the	OO
united	OU
states	.U
why	OU
do	OO
people	OO
leave	OO
their	OO
homes	,O
their	OO
beautiful	OO
homes	OO
that	OO
we	OO
go	OO
to	OO
as	OO
tourists	?O
because	OU
they	OO
don't	OO
have	OO
opportunities	OO
there	.O
and	OU
then	OO
we	OO
think	,O
hm	,U
bananas	.O
how	OU
many	OO
jillions	OO
of	OO
bananas	OO
do	OO
we	OO
consume	OO
in	OO
the	OO
united	OU
states	OU
every	OO
single	OO
day	?O
and	OU
throughout	OO
the	OO
world	.O
now	,U
do	OO
the	OO
people	OO
in	OO
central	OU
america	OU
get	OO
the	OO
profits	OO
from	OO
the	OO
bananas	OO
that	OO
we	OO
consume	?O
no	,U
they	OO
don't	.O
the	OU
profits	OO
go	OO
to	OO
corporations	OO
from	OO
the	OO
united	OU
states	OU
of	OO
america	.U
and	OU
we	OO
think	OO
that	OO
this	OO
is	OO
wrong	.O
now	,U
if	OO
the	OO
people	OO
in	OO
central	OU
america	OU
were	OO
to	OO
be	OO
able	OO
to	OO
get	OO
some	OO
of	OO
that	OO
money	OO
that	OO
we	OO
pay	OO
for	OO
bananas	,O
then	OO
they	OO
wouldn't	OO
have	OO
to	OO
leave	OO
their	OO
homes	.O
they	OU
wouldn't	OO
have	OO
to	OO
come	OO
as	OO
asylum	OO
seekers	OO
to	OO
the	OO
borders	OO
of	OO
the	OO
united	OU
states	OU
of	OO
america	.U
and	OU
then	OO
maybe	,O
many	OO
children	OO
would	OO
not	OO
have	OO
to	OO
be	OO
separated	OO
from	OO
their	OO
parents	.O
now	,U
we	OO
know	OO
that	OO
there	OO
are	OO
countries	OO
in	OO
the	OO
world	OO
that	OO
actually	OO
have	OO
free	OO
education	OO
and	OO
have	OO
free	OO
health	OO
care	OO
for	OO
all	OO
of	OO
the	OO
people	OO
in	OO
their	OO
country	.O
and	OU
that	OO
country	OO
is	OO
cuba	.U
cuba	OU
has	OO
health	OO
care	OO
for	OO
every	OO
one	OO
of	OO
their	OO
citizens	,O
and	OO
they	OO
have	OO
a	OO
free	OO
college	OO
education	OO
for	OO
every	OO
one	OO
of	OO
their	OO
citizens	.O
they're	OU
11	OO
million	OO
citizens	.O
now	,U
we	OO
think	,O
if	OO
a	OO
poor	OO
country	OO
like	OO
cuba	OU
can	OO
have	OO
these	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
resources	,O
and	OO
we	OO
know	OO
that	OO
they're	OO
a	OO
poor	OO
country	,O
then	OO
why	OO
can't	OO
some	OO
of	OO
the	OO
other	OO
wealthier	OO
countries	,O
like	OO
the	OO
united	OU
states	OU
of	OO
america	,U
do	OO
the	OO
same	?O
i	OU
think	OO
that	OO
we	OO
can	OO
make	OO
that	OO
happen	.O
but	OU
we	OO
know	OO
it's	OO
not	OO
going	OO
to	OO
happen	OO
until	OO
we	,O
the	OO
people	OO
of	OO
the	OO
united	OU
states	OU
of	OO
america	,U
and	OO
people	OO
throughout	OO
the	OO
world	,O
start	OO
making	OO
sure	OO
that	OO
they	OO
get	OO
public	OO
officials	OO
elected	OO
to	OO
their	OO
governments	OO
that	OO
really	OO
care	OO
about	OO
the	OO
constituents	,O
they	OO
care	OO
about	OO
people	,O
they	OO
will	OO
commit	OO
to	OO
make	OO
sure	OO
that	OO
the	OO
resources	OO
that	OO
they	OO
have	OO
are	OO
going	OO
to	OO
be	OO
used	OO
for	OO
their	OO
citizens	,O
and	OO
not	OO
to	OO
be	OO
used	OO
for	OO
war	.O
so	,U
how	OO
do	OO
we	OO
make	OO
this	OO
happen	?O
we	OU
have	OO
to	OO
get	OO
rid	OO
of	OO
the	OO
apathy	,O
we	OO
have	OO
to	OO
get	OO
more	OO
people	OO
involved	.O
we	OU
know	OO
that	OO
if	OO
we	OO
can't	OO
have	OO
a	OO
democracy	OO
in	OO
the	OO
united	OU
states	,U
we	OO
can't	OO
have	OO
democracies	OO
throughout	OO
the	OO
world	,O
unless	OO
people	OO
participate	.O
so	OU
it	OO
is	OO
imperative	OO
that	OO
all	OO
of	OO
us	OO
get	OO
out	OO
there	OO
and	OO
we	OO
say	,O
get	OU
rid	OO
of	OO
the	OO
apathy	,O
get	OO
off	OO
of	OO
the	OO
sidewalk	,O
come	OO
and	OO
join	OO
the	OO
march	OO
for	OO
peace	OO
and	OO
justice	,O
let's	OO
make	OO
coretta	OU
scott's	OU
vision	OO
a	OO
reality	,O
to	OO
have	OO
peace	OO
in	OO
the	OO
world	.O
we	OU
recently	OO
had	OO
midterm	OO
elections	OO
in	OO
the	OO
united	OU
states	OU
of	OO
america	.U
and	OU
what	OO
did	OO
we	OO
see	?O
we	OU
saw	OO
that	OO
so	OO
many	OO
more	OO
women	,O
young	OO
people	,O
people	OO
of	OO
color	,O
lgbt	OU
folks	,O
were	OO
all	OO
elected	OO
to	OO
public	OO
office	.O
and	OU
we	OO
know	OO
this	OO
happened	OO
—	OO
why	?O
because	OU
so	OO
many	OO
women	OO
were	OO
on	OO
the	OO
march	.O
we	OU
had	OO
the	OO
women's	OU
march	OU
in	OO
the	OO
united	OU
states	.U
they	OU
had	OO
the	OO
women's	OU
marches	OU
all	OO
over	OO
the	OO
world	.O
and	OU
so	OO
we	OO
now	OO
see	OO
that	OO
we	OO
have	OO
this	OO
potential	.O
we	OU
have	OO
this	OO
potential	OO
to	OO
get	OO
rid	OO
of	OO
the	OO
apathy	.O
and	OU
if	OO
we	OO
get	OO
everyone	OO
involved	,O
get	OO
everyone	OO
committed	,O
then	,O
i	OU
think	,O
we	OO
can	OO
make	OO
coretta	OU
scott's	OU
vision	OO
come	OO
true	.O
so	,U
i	OU
want	OO
to	OO
just	OO
remind	OO
everybody	,O
throughout	OO
the	OO
world	,O
one	OO
of	OO
the	OO
things	OO
is	,O
we	OO
have	OO
power	,O
poor	OO
people	OO
have	OO
power	,O
every	OO
citizen	OO
has	OO
power	.O
but	OU
in	OO
order	OO
to	OO
achieve	OO
the	OO
peace	OO
that	OO
we	OO
all	OO
yearn	OO
for	,O
then	OO
we've	OO
all	OO
got	OO
to	OO
get	OO
involved	.O
so	,U
what	OO
do	OO
we	OO
say	?O
can	OU
we	OO
do	OO
it	?O
we	OU
say	,O
yes	,U
we	OO
can	.O
and	OU
in	OO
spanish	,U
we	OO
say	,O
sí	,U
se	OO
puede	.O
thank	OU
you	OO
very	OO
much	.O
myths	OU
and	OO
misconceptions	OO
about	OO
evolution	.O
let's	OU
talk	OO
about	OO
evolution	.O
you've	OU
probably	OO
heard	OO
that	OO
some	OO
people	OO
consider	OO
it	OO
controversial	,O
even	OO
though	OO
most	OO
scientists	OO
don't	.O
but	OU
even	OO
if	OO
you	OO
aren't	OO
one	OO
of	OO
those	OO
people	OO
and	OO
you	OO
think	OO
you	OO
have	OO
a	OO
pretty	OO
good	OO
understanding	OO
of	OO
evolution	,O
chances	OO
are	OO
you	OO
still	OO
believe	OO
some	OO
things	OO
about	OO
it	OO
that	OO
aren't	OO
entirely	OO
right	,O
things	OO
like	,O
evolution	OU
is	OO
organisms	OO
adapting	OO
to	OO
their	OO
environment	.O

almost	OU
60	OO

before	OO

that	OO

then	OO
passing	OO
those	OO

their	OO

for	OU
example	,O
he	OO
thought	OO
that	OO
because	OO

spent	OO
their	OO
lives	OO
stretching	OO
to	OO

their	OO

we	OO

that's	OO

how	OO

in	OU

don't	OO
evolve	OO
at	OO
all	.O
instead	,U
random	OO
genetic	OO
mutations	OO
cause	OO
some	OO

to	OO
be	OO

that	OO

the	OO

who	OO

so	OO

which	OO

us	OO
to	OO

of	OO

this	OU

it	OO

the	OO

creatures	,O
which	OO

the	OO

for	OU

secondly	,U

how	OO

the	OO
world	OO
if	OO
full	OO

that	OO
it	OO

to	OO

find	OO
a	OO

before	OO

at	OO

we	OO
can	OO
say	OO
that	OO
if	OO

it's	OO

right	?O

in	OO

number	OO
two:	OO
if	OO
you	OO

with	OO
a	OO
force	OO
below	OO
the	OO

eventually	,O
the	OO

will	OO
start	OO
to	OO
flow	.O
in	OU
this	OO
case	,O
time	,O
not	OO
force	,O
is	OO
the	OO
key	OO
to	OO
releasing	OO
ketchup	OO
from	OO
its	OO
glassy	OO
prison	.O
alright	,U
so	,O
why	OO
does	OO
ketchup	OO
act	OO
all	OO
weird	?O
well	,U
it's	OO
made	OO
from	OO
tomatoes	,O
pulverized	,O
smashed	,O
thrashed	,O
utterly	OO
destroyed	OO
tomatoes	.O
see	OU
these	OO
tiny	OO
particles	?O
this	OU
is	OO
what	OO
remains	OO
of	OO
tomatoes	OO
cells	OO
after	OO
they	OO
go	OO
through	OO
the	OO
ketchup	OO
treatment	.O
and	OU
the	OO
liquid	OO
around	OO
those	OO
particles	?O
that's	OU
mostly	OO
water	OO
and	OO
some	OO
vinegar	,O
sugar	,O
and	OO
spices	.O
when	OU
ketchup	OO
is	OO
just	OO
sitting	OO
around	,O
the	OO
tomato	OO
particles	OO
are	OO
evenly	OO
and	OO
randomly	OO
distributed	.O
now	,U
let's	OO
say	OO
you	OO
apply	OO
a	OO
weak	OO
force	OO
very	OO
quickly	.O
the	OU
particles	OO
bump	OO
into	OO
each	OO
other	,O
but	OO
can't	OO
get	OO
out	OO
of	OO
each	OO
other's	OO
way	,O
so	OO
the	OO
ketchup	OO
doesn't	OO
flow	.O
now	,U
let's	OO
say	OO
you	OO
apply	OO
a	OO
strong	OO
force	OO
very	OO
quickly	.O
that	OU
extra	OO
force	OO
is	OO
enough	OO
to	OO
squish	OO
the	OO
tomato	OO
particles	,O
so	OO
maybe	OO
instead	OO
of	OO
little	OO
spheres	,O
they	OO
get	OO
smushed	OO
into	OO
little	OO
ellipses	,O
and	OO
boom	.O
now	OU
you	OO
have	OO
enough	OO
space	OO
for	OO
one	OO
group	OO
of	OO
particles	OO
to	OO
get	OO
passed	OO
others	OO
and	OO
the	OO
ketchup	OO
flows	.O
now	OU
let's	OO
say	OO
you	OO
apply	OO
a	OO
very	OO
weak	OO
force	OO
but	OO
for	OO
a	OO
very	OO
long	OO
time	.O
turns	OU
out	,O
we're	OO
not	OO
exactly	OO
sure	OO
what	OO
happens	OO
in	OO
this	OO
scenario	.O
one	OU
possibility	OO
is	OO
that	OO
the	OO
tomato	OO
particles	OO
near	OO
the	OO
walls	OO
of	OO
the	OO
container	OO
slowly	OO
get	OO
bumped	OO
towards	OO
the	OO
middle	,O
leaving	OO
the	OO
soup	OO
they	OO
were	OO
dissolved	OO
in	,O
which	OO
remember	OO
is	OO
basically	OO
water	,O
near	OO
the	OO

that	OU
water	OO

a	OO
lubricant	OO
betwen	OO
the	OO
glass	OO
bottle	OO
and	OO
the	OO
center	OO
plug	OO
of	OO
ketchup	,O
and	OO
so	OO
the	OO
ketchup	OO
flows	.O
another	OU
possibility	OO
is	OO
that	OO
the	OO
particles	OO
slowly	OO
rearrange	OO
themselves	OO
into	OO
lots	OO
of	OO
small	OO
groups	,O
which	OO
then	OO
flow	OO

how	OO

and	OO
its	OO
merry	OO
friends	OO
work	.O
ketchup	OU
basically	OO
gets	OO
thinner	OO
the	OO
harder	OO
you	OO
push	,O
but	OO
other	OO
substances	,O
like	OO
oobleck	OO
or	OO
some	OO
natural	OO
peanut	OO
butters	,O
actually	OO
get	OO
thicker	OO
the	OO
harder	OO
you	OO

can	OO
climb	OO
up	OO

to	OO

out	OO

them	OO
started	.O
from	OU
a	OO
physics	OO

though	,O
ketchup	OO
is	OO
one	OO
of	OO
the	OO
more	OO
complicated	OO
mixtures	OO
out	OO
there	.O

as	OO
if	OO
that	OO

the	OO

the	OO

which	OO
is	OO
also	OO
found	OO
in	OO
many	OO
fruit	OO

can	OO
mean	OO
that	OO
two	OO
different	OO
ketchups	OO
can	OO
behave	OO
completely	OO
differently	.O
but	OU
most	OO
will	OO
show	OO
two	OO
telltale	OO
properties:	OO
sudden	OO

at	OO
a	OO

after	OO
a	OO
small	OO
force	OO

applied	OO
for	OO
a	OO

that	OO

you	OO
could	OO
get	OO

out	OO
of	OO
the	OO

in	OO
two	OO
ways:	OO
either	OO

it	OO
a	OO

you	OO
could	OO
hit	OO
the	OO

hard	.O
what	OU
the	OO
real	OO

do	OO

keep	OO

how	OO

my	OU
interest	OO
in	OO

came	OO
about	OO
when	OO
i	OU
was	OO
searching	OO
for	OO
an	OO
architecture	OO
of	OO
the	OO
borderlands	.O
and	OU
i	OU
was	OO
working	OO
on	OO
several	OO
projects	OO
along	OO
the	OO
us	OU
mexico	OU
border	,O
designing	OO
buildings	OO
made	OO
out	OO
of	OO
mud	OO
taken	OO
right	OO
from	OO
the	OO
ground	.O
and	OU
i	OU
also	OO
work	OO
on	OO
projects	OO
that	OO
you	OO
might	OO
say	OO
immigrated	OO
to	OO
this	OO
landscape	.O
prada	OU
marfa	,U
a	OO
land	OO
art	OO
sculpture	OO
that	OO
crosses	OO
the	OO
border	OO
between	OO
art	OO
and	OO
architecture	,O
and	OO
it	OO
demonstrated	OO
to	OO
me	OO
that	OO
architecture	OO
could	OO
communicate	OO
ideas	OO
that	OO
are	OO
much	OO
more	OO
politically	OO
and	OO
culturally	OO
complex	,O
that	OO
architecture	OO
could	OO
be	OO
satirical	OO
and	OO
serious	OO
at	OO
the	OO
same	OO
time	OO
and	OO
it	OO
could	OO
speak	OO
to	OO
the	OO
disparities	OO
between	OO
wealth	OO
and	OO
poverty	OO
and	OO
what's	OO
local	OO
and	OO
what's	OO
foreign	.O
and	OU
so	OO
in	OO
my	OO
search	OO
for	OO
an	OO
architecture	OO
of	OO
the	OO
borderlands	,O
i	OU
began	OO
to	OO
wonder	,O
is	OO
the	OO
wall	OO
architecture	?O
i	OU
began	OO
to	OO
document	OO
my	OO
thoughts	OO
and	OO
visits	OO
to	OO
the	OO
wall	OO
by	OO
creating	OO
a	OO
series	OO
of	OO
souvenirs	OO
to	OO
remind	OO
us	OO
of	OO
the	OO
time	OO
when	OO
we	OO
built	OO
a	OO
wall	OO
and	OO
what	OO
a	OO
crazy	OO
idea	OO
that	OO
was	.O
i	OU
created	OO
border	OO
games	,O
postcards	,O
snow	OO
globes	OO
with	OO
little	OO
architectural	OO
models	OO
inside	OO
of	OO
them	,O
and	OO
maps	OO
that	OO
told	OO
the	OO
story	OO
of	OO
resilience	OO
at	OO
the	OO
wall	OO
and	OO
sought	OO
for	OO
ways	OO
that	OO
design	OO
could	OO
bring	OO
to	OO
light	OO
the	OO
problems	OO
that	OO
the	OO
border	OO
wall	OO
was	OO
creating	.O
so	,U
is	OO
the	OO
wall	OO
architecture	?O
well	,U
it	OO
certainly	OO
is	OO
a	OO
design	OO
structure	,O
and	OO
it's	OO
designed	OO
at	OO
a	OO
research	OO
facility	OO
called	OO
fencelab	,U
where	OO
they	OO
would	OO
load	OO
vehicles	OO
with	OO
10,000	OO
pounds	OO
and	OO
ram	OO
them	OO
into	OO
the	OO
wall	OO
at	OO
40	OO
miles	OO
an	OO
hour	OO
to	OO
test	OO
the	OO
wall's	OO
impermeability	.O
but	OU
there	OO
was	OO
also	OO
counter	OO
research	OO
going	OO
on	OO
on	OO
the	OO
other	OO
side	,O
the	OO
design	OO
of	OO
portable	OO
drawbridges	OO
that	OO
you	OO
could	OO
bring	OO
right	OO
up	OO
to	OO
the	OO
wall	OO
and	OO
allow	OO
vehicles	OO
to	OO
drive	OO
right	OO
over	.O
and	OU
like	OO
with	OO
all	OO
research	OO
projects	,O
there	OO
are	OO
successes	OO
and	OO
there	OO
are	OO
failures	.O
but	OU
it's	OO
these	OO
medieval	OO
reactions	OO
to	OO
the	OO
wall	OO
—	OO
drawbridges	,O
for	OO
example	OO
—	OO
that	OO
are	OO
because	OO
the	OO
wall	OO
itself	OO
is	OO
an	OO
arcane	,O
medieval	OO
form	OO
of	OO
architecture	.O
it's	OU
an	OO
overly	OO
simplistic	OO
response	OO
to	OO
a	OO
complex	OO
set	OO
of	OO
issues	.O
and	OU
a	OO
number	OO
of	OO
medieval	OO
technologies	OO
have	OO
sprung	OO
up	OO
along	OO
the	OO
wall:	OO
catapults	OO
that	OO
launch	OO
bales	OO
of	OO
marijuana	OO
over	OO
the	OO
wall	OO
or	OO
cannons	OO
that	OO
shoot	OO
packets	OO
of	OO
cocaine	OO
and	OO
heroin	OO
over	OO
the	OO
wall	.O
now	OU
during	OO
medieval	OO
times	,O
diseased	,O
dead	OO
bodies	OO
were	OO
sometimes	OO
catapulted	OO
over	OO
walls	OO
as	OO
an	OO
early	OO
form	OO
of	OO
biological	OO
warfare	,O
and	OO
it's	OO
speculated	OO
that	OO
today	,O
humans	OO
are	OO
being	OO
propelled	OO
over	OO
the	OO
wall	OO
as	OO
a	OO
form	OO
of	OO
immigration	.O
a	OU
ridiculous	OO
idea	.O
but	OU
the	OO
only	OO
person	OO
ever	OO
known	OO
to	OO

to	OO
have	OO
launched	OO
over	OO
the	OO

from	OO
mexico	OU
to	OO
the	OO
united	OU
states	OU
was	OO
in	OO
fact	OO
a	OO
us	OU
citizen	,O
who	OO
was	OO
given	OO
permission	OO
to	OO
human	OO
cannonball	OO
over	OO
the	OO
wall	,O
200	OO
feet	,O
so	OO
long	OO
as	OO
he	OO
carried	OO
his	OO

and	OO
he	OO
landed	OO
safely	OO
in	OO
a	OO
net	OO
on	OO
the	OO
other	OO
side	.O
and	OU
my	OO
thoughts	OO
are	OO
inspired	OO
by	OO
a	OO
quote	OO
by	OO
the	OO
architect	OO
hassan	OU
fathy	,U
who	OO
said	,O
architects	OU
do	OO
not	OO
design	OO
walls	,O
but	OO
the	OO
spaces	OO
between	OO
them	.O
so	OU
while	OO
i	OU
do	OO
not	OO
think	OO
that	OO
architects	OO
should	OO
be	OO
designing	OO
walls	,O
i	OU
do	OO
think	OO
it's	OO
important	OO
and	OO
urgent	OO
that	OO
they	OO
should	OO
be	OO
paying	OO
attention	OO
to	OO
those	OO
spaces	OO
in	OO
between	.O
they	OU
should	OO
be	OO
designing	OO
for	OO
the	OO
places	OO
and	OO
the	OO
people	,O
the	OO
landscapes	OO
that	OO
the	OO
wall	OO
endangers	.O
now	,U
people	OO
are	OO
already	OO
rising	OO
to	OO
this	OO
occasion	,O
and	OO
while	OO
the	OO
purpose	OO
of	OO
the	OO
wall	OO
is	OO
to	OO
keep	OO
people	OO
apart	OO
and	OO
away	,O
it's	OO
actually	OO
bringing	OO
people	OO
together	OO
in	OO
some	OO
really	OO
remarkable	OO
ways	,O
holding	OO
social	OO
events	OO
like	OO
binational	OO
yoga	OO
classes	OO
along	OO
the	OO
border	,O
to	OO
bring	OO
people	OO
together	OO
across	OO
the	OO
divide	.O
i	OU
call	OO
this	OO
the	OO
monument	OO
pose	.O
and	OU
have	OO
you	OO
ever	OO
heard	OO
of	OO
wall	OO
y	OO
ball	?O
it's	OU
a	OO
borderland	OO
version	OO
of	OO
volleyball	,O
and	OO
it's	OO
been	OO
played	OO
since	OO
1979	OO
along	OO
the	OO
us	OU
mexico	OU
border	OO
to	OO
celebrate	OO
binational	OO
heritage	.O
and	OU
it	OO
raises	OO
some	OO
interesting	OO
questions	,O
right	?O
is	OU
such	OO
a	OO
game	OO
even	OO
legal	?O
does	OU
hitting	OO
a	OO
ball	OO
back	OO
and	OO
forth	OO
over	OO
the	OO
wall	OO
constitute	OO
illegal	OO
trade	?O
the	OU
beauty	OO
of	OO
volleyball	OO
is	OO
that	OO
it	OO
transforms	OO
the	OO
wall	OO
into	OO
nothing	OO
more	OO
than	OO
a	OO
line	OO
in	OO
the	OO
sand	OO
negotiated	OO
by	OO
the	OO
minds	OO
and	OO
bodies	OO
and	OO
spirits	OO
of	OO
players	OO
on	OO
both	OO
sides	.O
and	OU
i	OU
think	OO
it's	OO
exactly	OO
these	OO
kinds	OO
of	OO
two	OO
sided	OO
negotiations	OO
that	OO
are	OO
needed	OO
to	OO
bring	OO
down	OO
walls	OO
that	OO
divide	.O
now	,U
throwing	OO
the	OO
ball	OO
over	OO
the	OO
wall	OO
is	OO
one	OO
thing	,O
but	OO
throwing	OO
rocks	OO
over	OO
the	OO
wall	OO
has	OO
caused	OO
damage	OO
to	OO
border	OU
patrol	OU
vehicles	OO
and	OO
have	OO
injured	OO
border	OU
patrol	OU
agents	,O
and	OO
the	OO
response	OO
from	OO
the	OO
us	OU
side	OO
has	OO
been	OO
drastic	.O
border	OU
patrol	OU
agents	OO
have	OO
fired	OO
through	OO
the	OO
wall	,O
killing	OO
people	OO
throwing	OO
rocks	OO
on	OO
the	OO
mexican	OU
side	.O
and	OU
another	OO
response	OO
by	OO
border	OU
patrol	OU
agents	OO
is	OO
to	OO
erect	OO
baseball	OO
backstops	OO
to	OO
protect	OO
themselves	OO
and	OO
their	OO
vehicles	.O
and	OU
these	OO
backstops	OO
became	OO
a	OO
permanent	OO
feature	OO
in	OO
the	OO
construction	OO
of	OO
new	OO
walls	.O
and	OU
i	OU
began	OO
to	OO
wonder	OO
if	,O
like	OO
volleyball	,O
maybe	OO
baseball	OO
should	OO
be	OO
a	OO
permanent	OO
feature	OO
at	OO
the	OO
border	,O
and	OO
walls	OO
could	OO
start	OO
opening	OO
up	,O
allowing	OO
communities	OO
to	OO
come	OO
across	OO
and	OO
play	,O
and	OO
if	OO
they	OO
hit	OO
a	OO
home	OO
run	,O
maybe	OO
a	OO
border	OU
patrol	OU
agent	OO
would	OO
pick	OO
up	OO
the	OO
ball	OO
and	OO
throw	OO
it	OO
back	OO
over	OO
to	OO
the	OO
other	OO
side	.O
a	OU
border	OU
patrol	OU
agent	OO
buys	OO
a	OO
raspado	,O
a	OO
frozen	OO
treat	,O
from	OO
a	OO
vendor	OO
just	OO
a	OO
couple	OO
feet	OO
away	,O
food	OO
and	OO
money	OO
is	OO
exchanged	OO
through	OO
the	OO
wall	,O
an	OO
entirely	OO
normal	OO
event	OO
made	OO
illegal	OO
by	OO
that	OO
line	OO
drawn	OO
on	OO
a	OO
map	OO
and	OO
a	OO
couple	OO
millimeters	OO
of	OO
steel	.O
and	OU
this	OO
scene	OO
reminded	OO
me	OO
of	OO
a	OO
saying:	OO
if	OU
you	OO
have	OO
more	OO
than	OO
you	OO
need	,O
you	OO
should	OO
build	OO
longer	OO
tables	OO
and	OO
not	OO
higher	OO
walls	.O
so	OU
i	OU
created	OO
this	OO
souvenir	OO
to	OO
remember	OO
the	OO
moment	OO
that	OO
we	OO
could	OO
share	OO
food	OO
and	OO
conversation	OO
across	OO
the	OO
divide	.O
a	OU
swing	OO
allows	OO
one	OO
to	OO
enter	OO
and	OO
swing	OO
over	OO
to	OO
the	OO
other	OO
side	OO
until	OO
gravity	OO
deports	OO
them	OO
back	OO
to	OO
their	OO
own	OO
country	.O
the	OU
border	OO
and	OO
the	OO
border	OO
wall	OO
is	OO
thought	OO
of	OO
as	OO
a	OO
sort	OO
of	OO
political	OO
theater	OO
today	,O
so	OO
perhaps	OO
we	OO
should	OO
invite	OO
audiences	OO
to	OO
that	OO
theater	,O
to	OO
a	OO
binational	OO
theater	OO
where	OO
people	OO
can	OO
come	OO
together	OO
with	OO
performers	,O
musicians	.O
maybe	OU
the	OO
wall	OO
is	OO
nothing	OO
more	OO
than	OO
an	OO
enormous	OO
instrument	,O
the	OO
world's	OO
largest	OO
xylophone	,O
and	OO
we	OO
could	OO
play	OO
down	OO
this	OO
wall	OO
with	OO
weapons	OO
of	OO
mass	OO
percussion	.O
when	OU
i	OU
envisioned	OO
this	OO
binational	OO
library	,O
i	OU
wanted	OO
to	OO
imagine	OO
a	OO
space	OO
where	OO
one	OO
could	OO
share	OO
books	OO
and	OO
information	OO
and	OO
knowledge	OO
across	OO
a	OO
divide	,O
where	OO
the	OO
wall	OO
was	OO
nothing	OO
more	OO
than	OO
a	OO
bookshelf	.O
and	OU
perhaps	OO
the	OO
best	OO
way	OO
to	OO
illustrate	OO
the	OO
mutual	OO
relationship	OO
that	OO
we	OO
have	OO
with	OO
mexico	OU
and	OO
the	OO
united	OU
states	OU
is	OO
by	OO
imagining	OO
a	OO
teeter	OO
totter	,O
where	OO
the	OO
actions	OO
on	OO
one	OO
side	OO
had	OO
a	OO
direct	OO
consequence	OO
on	OO
what	OO
happens	OO
on	OO
the	OO
other	OO
side	,O
because	OO
you	OO
see	,O
the	OO
border	OO
itself	OO
is	OO
both	OO
a	OO
symbolic	OO
and	OO
literal	OO
fulcrum	OO
for	OO
us	OU
mexico	OU
relations	,O
and	OO
building	OO
walls	OO
between	OO
neighbors	OO
severs	OO
those	OO
relationships	.O
you	OU
probably	OO
remember	OO
this	OO
quote	,O
good	OU
fences	OO
make	OO
good	OO
neighbors	.O
it's	OU
often	OO
thought	OO
of	OO
as	OO
the	OO
moral	OO
of	OO
robert	OU
frost's	OU
poem	OO
mending	OU
wall	.U
but	OU
the	OO
poem	OO
is	OO
really	OO
about	OO
questioning	OO
the	OO
need	OO
for	OO
building	OO
walls	OO
at	OO
all	.O
it's	OU
really	OO
a	OO
poem	OO
about	OO
mending	OO
human	OO
relationships	.O
my	OU
favorite	OO
line	OO
is	OO
the	OO
first	OO
one:	OO
something	OU
there	OO
is	OO
that	OO
doesn't	OO
love	OO
a	OO
wall	.O
because	OU
if	OO
there's	OO
one	OO
thing	OO
that's	OO
clear	OO
to	OO
me	OO
—	OO
there	OO
are	OO
not	OO
two	OO
sides	OO
defined	OO
by	OO
a	OO
wall	.O
this	OU
is	OO
one	OO
landscape	,O
divided	.O
on	OU
one	OO

it	OO
might	OO
look	OO

this	.O
a	OU
man	OO
is	OO
mowing	OO
his	OO

while	OO
the	OO

is	OO
looming	OO
in	OO

and	OU
on	OO
the	OO

it	OO

this	.O
the	OU
wall	OO
is	OO
the	OO

of	OO

but	OU
the	OO
reality	OO
is	OO
that	OO
the	OO

is	OO
cutting	OO

it	OU

a	OO

you	OO

that	OO
even	OO
though	OO

to	OO

to	OO

from	OO

here’s	OU
the	OO
key	OO
insight:	OO
if	OU
you	OO
start	OO
a	OO
fuse	OO
on	OO
one	OO
side	OO
and	OO
it	OO
burns	OO
for	OO
30	OO
seconds	,O
there’ll	OO
still	OO
be	OO
30	OO
seconds	OO
of	OO

left	.O
if	OU
you	OO
had	OO
started	OO
it	OO
from	OO
the	OO

it	OO
would’ve	OO
reached	OO
the	OO
exact	OO
same	OO
spot	OO
in	OO
thirty	OO
seconds	.O
that	OU
means	OO
that	OO
if	OO
you	OO
lit	OO
it	OO
from	OO
both	OO
ends	OO
simultaneously	,O
it	OO
would	OO
burn	OO
out	OO
in	OO
precisely	OO
30	OO
seconds	.O
but	OU
how	OO
will	OO
you	OO
time	OO
the	OO
last	OO
fifteen	?O
that’ll	OU
have	OO
to	OO
come	OO
from	OO
the	OO
second	OO
fuse	.O
if	OU
it	OO
were	OO
a	OO
30	OO
second	OO
fuse	,O
you’d	OO
be	OO
able	OO
to	OO
use	OO
that	OO
same	OO
trick	OO
again	OO
to	OO
double	OO
the	OO
burning	OO
speed	OO
and	OO
make	OO
it	OO
last	OO
exactly	OO
15	OO
seconds	.O
and	,U
you	OO
realize	,O
you	OO
can	OO
shorten	OO
the	OO

by	OO

it	OO

reservations	,O
a	OO
penalty	OO
of	OO
death	?O
my	OU
answer	OO
was	OO
an	OO
astounding	OO
yes	,O
and	OO
i	OU
was	OO
selected	OO
as	OO
juror	OU
number	OU
2	.O
the	OU
trial	OO
started	.O
from	OU
the	OO
evidence	OO
being	OO
presented	OO
and	OO
from	OO
the	OO
pictures	OO
of	OO
the	OO
victim	,O
my	OO
first	OO
response	OO
was	,O
yes	,U
this	OO
man	OO
is	OO
a	OO
monster	,O
and	OO
he	OO
deserves	OO
the	OO
death	OO
penalty	.O
for	OU
days	,O
i	OU
sat	OO
and	OO
looked	OO
at	OO
his	OO
hands	,O
the	OO
ones	OO
that	OO
yielded	OO
the	OO
knife	,O
and	OO
against	OO
his	OO
pasty	OO
white	OO
skin	,O
his	OO
eyes	.O
well	,U
he	OO
spent	OO
endless	OO
days	OO
in	OO
his	OO
cell	,O
no	OO
sunlight	,O
so	OO
his	OO
eyes	OO
were	OO
as	OO
black	OO
as	OO
his	OO
hair	OO
and	OO
his	OO
mustache	.O
he	OU
was	OO
very	OO
intimidating	,O
and	OO
there	OO
was	OO
absolutely	OO
no	OO
doubt	OO
in	OO
his	OO
guilt	.O
but	OU
regardless	OO
of	OO
his	OO
guilt	,O
as	OO
the	OO
days	OO
passed	,O
i	OU
began	OO
to	OO
see	OO
this	OO
monster	OO
as	OO
a	OO
human	OO
being	.O
something	OU
inside	OO
of	OO
me	OO
was	OO
changing	OO
that	OO
i	OU
just	OO
didn't	OO
understand	.O
i	OU
was	OO
beginning	OO
to	OO
question	OO
myself	OO
as	OO
to	OO
whether	OO
or	OO
not	OO
i	OU
wanted	OO
to	OO
give	OO
this	OO
man	OO
the	OO
death	OO
penalty	.O
jury	OU
deliberations	OO
began	,O
and	OO
the	OO
judge	OO
gave	OO
us	OO
jury	OO
instructions	OO
and	OO
it	OO
was	OO
to	OO
be	OO
used	OO
as	OO
a	OO
tool	OO
in	OO
how	OO
to	OO
reach	OO
a	OO
verdict	.O
well	,U
using	OO
this	OO
tool	OO
only	OO
led	OO
to	OO
one	OO
decision	,O
and	OO
that	OO
was	OO
the	OO
death	OO
penalty	.O
i	OU
felt	OO
backed	OO
into	OO
a	OO
corner	.O
my	OU
head	OO
and	OO
my	OO
heart	OO
were	OO
in	OO
conflict	OO
with	OO
each	OO
other	,O
and	OO
the	OO
thought	OO
of	OO
the	OO
death	OO
penalty	OO
made	OO
me	OO
sick	.O
however	,U
following	OO
the	OO
judge's	OO
instructions	,O
being	OO
a	OO
law	OO
abiding	OO
person	,O
i	OU
gave	OO
up	.O
i	OU
gave	OO
up	OO
and	OO
voted	OO
along	OO
with	OO
the	OO
other	OO
11	OO
jurors	.O
and	OU
there	OO
it	OO
was:	OO
our	OO
broken	OO
judicial	OO
system	OO
at	OO
work	.O
so	OU
here	OO
i	OU
am	OO
in	OO
my	OO
car	,O
and	OO
i'm	OU
wondering:	OO
how	OU
is	OO
my	OO
life	OO
ever	OO
going	OO
to	OO
be	OO
the	OO
same	?O
my	OU
life	OO
was	OO
kids	,O
work	,O
church	,O
ball	OO
games	OO
—	OO
just	OO
your	OO
average	,O
normal	,O
everyday	OO
life	.O
now	OU
everything	OO
felt	OO
trivial	.O
i	OU
was	OO
going	OO
down	OO
this	OO
rabbit	OO
hole	.O
the	OU
anger	,O
the	OO
anxiety	,O
the	OO
guilt	,O
the	OO
depression	.O
it	OO
just	OO
clung	OO
to	OO
me	.O
i	OU
knew	OO
that	OO
my	OO
life	OO
had	OO
to	OO
resume	,O
so	OO
i	OU
sought	OO
counseling	.O
the	OU
counselor	OO
diagnosed	OO
me	OO
with	OO
ptsd	OU
and	OO
told	OO
me	OO
that	OO
the	OO
best	OO
way	OO
to	OO
overcome	OO
the	OO
ptsd	OU
was	OO
to	OO
talk	OO
about	OO
the	OO
trauma	.O
however	,U
if	OO
i	OU
talked	OO
or	OO
tried	OO
to	OO
talk	OO
about	OO
the	OO
trauma	OO
outside	OO
her	OO
office	,O
i	OU
was	OO
shut	OO
down	.O
no	OU
one	OO
wanted	OO
to	OO
hear	OO
about	OO
it	.O
he	OU
was	OO
just	OO
a	OO
murderer	.O
get	OU
over	OO
it	.O
it	OU
was	OO
then	OO
that	OO
i	OU
decided	OO
to	OO
become	OO
a	OO
silent	OO
survivor	.O
twelve	OU
years	OO
later	,O
2006	,O
i	OU
learned	OO
that	OO
bobby	OU
wilcher	OU
had	OO
dropped	OO
all	OO
of	OO
his	OO
appeals	,O
and	OO
his	OO
execution	OO
date	OO
was	OO
approaching	.O
that	OU
was	OO
like	OO
a	OO
punch	OO
in	OO
the	OO
stomach	.O
all	OU
of	OO
those	OO
buried	OO
feelings	OO
just	OO
started	OO
coming	OO
back	.O
to	OU
try	OO
and	OO
find	OO
peace	,O
i	OU
called	OO
bobby's	OU
attorney	,O
and	OO
i	OU
said	,O
can	OU
i	OU
see	OO
bobby	OU
before	OO
he's	OO
executed	?O
driving	OU
to	OO
the	OO
penitentiary	OO
on	OO
the	OO
day	OO
of	OO
his	OO
execution	,O
in	OO
my	OO
mind	,O
bobby	OU
was	OO
going	OO
to	OO
be	OO
manic	.O
but	,U
surprisingly	,O
he	OO
was	OO
very	OO
calm	.O
and	OU
for	OO
two	OO
hours	,O
he	OO
and	OO
i	OU
sat	OO
there	OO
and	OO
talked	OO
about	OO
life	,O
and	OO
i	OU
got	OO
to	OO
ask	OO
him	OO
to	OO
forgive	OO
me	OO
for	OO
my	OO
hand	OO
in	OO
his	OO
death	.O
his	OU
words	OO
to	OO
me	OO
were:	OO
you	OU
don't	OO
have	OO
to	OO
apologize	.O
you	OU
didn't	OO
put	OO
me	OO
here	.O
i	OU
did	OO
this	OO
myself	.O
but	OU
if	OO
it'll	OO
make	OO
you	OO
feel	OO
better	,O
i	OU
forgive	OO
you	.O
on	OU
my	OO
way	OO
home	,O
i	OU
stopped	OO
by	OO
a	OO
restaurant	OO
and	OO
bought	OO
a	OO
margarita	.O
i	OU
don't	OO
think	OO
i	OU
could	OO
get	OO
one	OO
big	OO
enough	OO
—	OO
to	OO
try	OO
and	OO
calm	OO
down	.O
my	OU
phone	OO
rang	.O
it	OU
was	OO
bobby's	OU
attorney	.O
within	OU
two	OO
minutes	OO
of	OO
his	OO
execution	,O
they	OO
had	OO
given	OO
him	OO
a	OO
stay	.O
this	OU
stay	OO
gave	OO
me	OO
time	OO
to	OO
reach	OO
out	OO
to	OO
bobby	.U
and	OU
as	OO
crazy	OO
as	OO
it	OO
may	OO
sound	,O
we	OO
became	OO
friends	.O
three	OU
months	OO
later	,O
he	OO
was	OO
executed	OO
by	OO
the	OO
state	OU
of	OO
mississippi	.U
i'm	OU
here	OO
to	OO
tell	OO
you	OO
my	OO
story	,O
because	OO
it	OO
was	OO
precisely	OO
22	OO
years	OO
later	OO
that	OO
i	OU
even	OO
wanted	OO
to	OO
open	OO
up	OO
enough	OO
to	OO
talk	OO
about	OO
it	,O
when	OO
a	OO
friend	OO
encouraged	OO
me	.O
hey	,U
perhaps	OO
you	OO
need	OO
to	OO
talk	OO
to	OO
the	OO
other	OO
jurors	.O
you've	OU
been	OO
through	OO
the	OO
same	OO
experience	.O
uncertain	OU
of	OO
what	OO
i	OU
was	OO
after	,O
i	OU
did	OO
need	OO
to	OO
talk	OO
to	OO
them	.O
so	OU
i	OU
set	OO
out	OO
on	OO
my	OO
quest	,O
and	OO
i	OU
actually	OO
found	OO
most	OO
of	OO
them	.O
the	OU
first	OO
juror	OO
i	OU
met	OO
thought	OO
that	OO
bobby	OU
got	OO
what	OO
he	OO
deserved	.O
another	OU
juror	OO
—	OO
well	,O
they	OO
just	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
regretted	OO
that	OO
it	OO
took	OO
so	OO
long	OO
to	OO
carry	OO
the	OO
sentence	OO
out	.O
then	OU
one	OO
juror	,O
and	OO
i	OU
don't	OO
know	OO
what	OO
was	OO
wrong	OO
with	OO
him	,O
but	OO
he	OO
didn't	OO
remember	OO
anything	OO
about	OO
the	OO
trial	.O
well	,U
i'm	OU
thinking	OO
in	OO
my	OO
mind	,O
jeez	,U
is	OO
this	OO
the	OO
response	OO
i'm	OU
gonna	OO
get	OO
from	OO
everybody	OO
else	?O
well	,U
thank	OO
god	OU
for	OO
allen	.U
allen	OU
was	OO
a	OO
gentle	OO
soul	.O
and	OU
when	OO
i	OU
talked	OO
to	OO
him	,O
he	OO
was	OO
genuinely	OO
upset	OO
about	OO
our	OO
decision	.O
and	OU
he	OO
told	OO
me	OO
about	OO
the	OO
day	OO
that	OO
the	OO
devastation	OO
really	OO
set	OO
in	OO
on	OO
him	OO
and	OO
hit	OO
him	.O
he	OU
was	OO
listening	OO
to	OO
the	OO
radio	,O
and	OO
the	OO
radio	OO
had	OO
a	OO
list	OO
of	OO
names	OO
of	OO
men	OO
to	OO
be	OO
executed	OO
at	OO
parchman	OU
penitentiary	.U
he	OU
heard	OO
bobby's	OU
name	,O
and	OO
he	OO
then	OO
truly	OO
realized	OO
what	OO
he	OO
had	OO
done	.O
and	OU
he	OO
said	,O
you	OU
know	,O
i	OU
had	OO
a	OO
responsibility	OO
in	OO
that	OO
man's	OO
death	.O
now	OU
here	OO
it	OO
is	,O
20	OO
something	OO
years	OO
later	,O
and	OO
allen	OU
is	OO
still	OO
dealing	OO
with	OO
that	OO
issue	.O
and	OU
he's	OO
never	OO
told	OO
anyone	OO
about	OO
it	,O
not	OO
even	OO
his	OO
wife	.O
he	OU
also	OO
told	OO
me	OO
that	OO
if	OO
the	OO
state	OU
of	OO
mississippi	OU
wanted	OO
to	OO
keep	OO
the	OO
death	OO
penalty	,O
then	OO
hey	,O
they	OO
needed	OO
to	OO
provide	OO
counseling	OO
for	OO
the	OO
jurors	.O
then	OU
the	OO
next	OO
juror	OO
i	OU
met	OO
was	OO
jane	.U
jane	OU
is	OO
now	OO
totally	OO
against	OO
the	OO
death	OO
penalty	,O
and	OU
there	OO
was	OO
bill	.U
bill	OU
said	OO
he	OO
had	OO
this	OO
crushing	OO
depression	OO
for	OO
weeks	,O
and	OO
when	OO
he	OO
went	OO
back	OO
to	OO
work	,O
his	OO
colleagues	OO
would	OO
say	OO
things	OO
to	OO
him	OO
like	,O
hey	,U
did	OO
you	OO
fry	OO
him	?O
to	OU
them	,O
it	OO
was	OO
just	OO
a	OO
joke	.O
then	OU
there	OO
was	OO
jon	.U
jon	OU
said	OO
his	OO
decision	OO
weighed	OO
on	OO
him	,O
and	OO
it	OO
burdened	OO
him	OO
daily	.O
the	OU
final	OO
juror	OO
that	OO
i	OU
spoke	OO
to	OO
was	OO
ken	.U
ken	OU
was	OO
the	OO
foreman	OO
of	OO
the	OO
jury	.O
when	OU
we	OO
sat	OO
down	OO
to	OO
talk	,O
it	OO
was	OO
apparent	OO
that	OO
he	OO
was	OO
deeply	OO
saddened	OO
by	OO
what	OO
we	OO
were	OO
required	OO
to	OO
do	.O
he	OU
relived	OO
the	OO
day	OO
that	OO
he	OO
left	OO
the	OO
courthouse	OO
and	OO
he	OO
drove	OO
home	OO
and	OO
he	OO
went	OO
to	OO
put	OO
his	OO
key	OO
in	OO
his	OO
door	OO
and	OO
unlock	OO
it	,O
and	OO
he	OO
said	OO
he	OO
literally	OO
broke	OO
down	.O
he	OU
said	OO
he	OO
knew	OO
that	OO
bobby	OU
was	OO
guilty	,O
but	OO
the	OO
decision	OO
he	OO
made	,O
he	OO
did	OO
not	OO
know	OO
if	OO
it	OO
was	OO
the	OO
right	OO
decision	.O
and	OU
he	OO
said	OO
that	OO
he	OO
played	OO
it	OO
over	OO
and	OO
over	OO
in	OO
his	OO
head	.O
did	OU
we	OO
do	OO
the	OO
right	OO
thing	?O
did	OU
we	OO
do	OO
the	OO
right	OO
thing	?O
did	OU
we	OO
do	OO
the	OO
right	OO
thing	?O
all	OU
those	OO
years	,O
and	OO
i	OU
finally	OO
realized	OO
that	OO
i	OU
was	OO
not	OO
the	OO
only	OO
disillusioned	OO
juror	.O
and	OU
we	OO
talked	OO
about	OO
sharing	OO
our	OO
experience	OO
with	OO
potential	OO
jurors	OO
to	OO
give	OO
them	OO
some	OO
insight	OO
into	OO
what	OO
to	OO
expect	,O
and	OO
to	OO
tell	OO
them	OO
do	OO
not	OO
be	OO
complacent;	OO
to	OO
know	OO
what	OO
you	OO
believe;	OO
to	OO
know	OO
where	OO
you	OO
stand	OO
and	OO
be	OO
prepared	,O
because	OO
you	OO
don't	OO
want	OO
to	OO
walk	OO
in	OO
one	OO
morning	OO
as	OO
a	OO
juror	OO
and	OO
leave	OO
at	OO
the	OO
end	OO
of	OO
the	OO
trial	OO
feeling	OO
like	OO
a	OO
murderer	.O
now	,U
through	OO
this	OO
storm	OO
in	OO
my	OO
life	,O
i	OU
did	OO
find	OO
some	OO
inspiration	,O
and	OO
it	OO
came	OO
in	OO
the	OO
form	OO
of	OO
my	OO
granddaughters	.O
my	OU
14	OO
year	OO
old	OO
granddaughter	,O
maddie	,U
was	OO
writing	OO
an	OO
essay	OO
on	OO
the	OO
death	OO
penalty	OO
for	OO
school	,O
and	OO
she	OO
was	OO
asking	OO
me	OO
questions	.O
well	,U
it	OO
dawned	OO
on	OO
me	OO
that	OO
this	OO
child	OO
was	OO
being	OO
raised	OO
in	OO
the	OO
same	OO
eye	OO
for	OO
an	OO
eye	OO
culture	OO
as	OO
i	OU
was	,O
or	OO
had	OO
been	.O
and	OU
so	OO
i	OU
explained	OO
my	OO
experience	OO
to	OO
her	OO
this	OO
way:	OO
that	OO
i	OU
had	OO
sentenced	OO
someone	OO
to	OO
death	OO
as	OO
i	OU
served	OO
on	OO
a	OO
jury	.O
and	OU
i	OU
asked	OO
her	,O
did	OU
that	OO
make	OO
me	OO
a	OO
murderer	?O
she	OU
couldn't	OO
answer	.O
i	OU
knew	OO
then	OO
that	OO
this	OO
topic	OO
needed	OO
to	OO
be	OO
open	OO
for	OO
discussion	.O
and	OU
guess	OO
what	OO
happened	?O
i	OU
got	OO
invited	OO
to	OO
speak	,O
just	OO
recently	,O
in	OO
an	OO
abolitionist	OO
community	.O
while	OU
i	OU
was	OO
there	,O
i	OU
got	OO
a	OO
t	OU
shirt	.O
it	OU
says	,O
stop	OU
executions	.U
well	,U
when	OO
i	OU
get	OO
home	,O
my	OO
16	OO
year	OO
old	OO
granddaughter	OO
was	OO
there	,O
anna	,U
and	OO
she	OO
says	,O
can	OU
i	OU
have	OO
that	OO
shirt	?O
well	,U
i	OU
looked	OO
at	OO
her	OO
dad	OO
—	OO
her	OO
dad	OO
is	OO
my	OO
son	OO
—	OO
and	OO
i	OU
knew	OO
that	OO
he	OO
is	OO
still	OO
dealing	OO
with	OO
this	OO
death	OO
penalty	OO
issue	.O
so	OU
i	OU
turned	OO
around	OO
and	OO
i	OU
looked	OO
at	OO
her	,O
and	OO
i	OU
said	,O
are	OU
you	OO
gonna	OO
wear	OO
this	?O
so	OU
she	OO
turned	OO
and	OO
she	OO
looked	OO
at	OO
her	OO
dad	,O
and	OO
she	OO
said	,O
dad	,U
i	OU
know	OO
how	OO
you	OO
feel	,O
but	OO
i	OU
don't	OO
believe	OO
in	OO
the	OO
death	OO
penalty	.O
my	OU
son	OO
looked	OO
at	OO
me	,O
shook	OO
his	OO
head	,O
and	OO
said	,O
thanks	,U
mom	.U
and	OU
i	OU
knew	OO
it	OO
wasn't	OO
a	OO
nice	OO
thanks	,U
mom	.U
so	OU
i	OU
learned	OO
that	OO
life	OO
had	OO
taught	OO
me	OO
some	OO
lessons	.O
it	OU
taught	OO
me	,O
if	OO
i	OU
had	OO
not	OO
served	OO
on	OO
that	OO
jury	,O
that	OO
i	OU
would	OO
still	OO
be	OO
of	OO
the	OO
same	OO
mindset	.O
it	OU
also	OO
gave	OO
me	OO
confidence	OO
to	OO
be	OO
able	OO
to	OO
see	OO
through	OO
the	OO
eyes	OO
of	OO
my	OO
granddaughters	,O
that	OO
this	OO
younger	OO
generation	,O
they're	OO
capable	OO
and	OO
they're	OO
willing	OO
to	OO
tackle	OO
these	OO
difficult	OO
social	OO
issues	.O
and	OU
because	OO
of	OO
my	OO
experience	,O
my	OO
granddaughters	,O
they're	OO
now	OO
more	OO
equipped	OO
to	OO
stand	OO
on	OO
their	OO
own	OO
and	OO
to	OO
think	OO
for	OO
themselves	OO
than	OO
to	OO
rely	OO
on	OO
cultural	OO
beliefs	.O
so:	OU
being	OO
from	OO
a	OO
conservative	,O
christian	OU
family	OO
from	OO
a	OO
very	OO
conservative	OO
state	OO
in	OO
the	OO
united	OU
states	,U
i	OU
am	OO
here	OO
to	OO
tell	OO
you	OO
that	OO
the	OO
death	OO
penalty	OO
has	OO
new	OO
opponents	.O
thank	OU
you	.O
computers	OU
used	OO
to	OO
be	OO
as	OO
big	OO
as	OO
a	OO
room	.O
but	OU
now	OO
they	OO
fit	OO
in	OO
your	OO
pocket	,O
on	OO
your	OO
wrist	OO
and	OO
can	OO

it	OO

just	OO

the	OU

why	OO
the	OO

is	OO
due	OO

the	OU

after	OO

we	OO
can	OO
now	OO
achieve	OO

down	OO

10	OO

you	OU
can	OO
fit	OO
more	OO

a	OO

in	OO
a	OO
single	OO

of	OO
silicon	.O
and	OU
to	OO
put	OO
this	OO
into	OO
perspective:	OO
a	OO
human	OO
hair	OO
is	OO
100	OO
microns	OO
across	.O
a	OU
red	OO
blood	OO
cell	,O
which	OO

and	OO
you	OO
can	OO
place	OO
12	OO
across	OO
the	OO

of	OO
a	OO
human	OO
hair	.O
but	OU
a	OO
transistor	,O
in	OO

is	OO
much	OO
smaller	,O
at	OO
a	OO
tiny	OO
fraction	OO
of	OO
a	OO

you	OU
could	OO
place	OO
more	OO

260	OO

across	OO
a	OO

or	OO
more	OO
than	OO
3,000	OO
across	OO
the	OO

of	OO
a	OO
human	OO
hair	.O
it	OU
really	OO
is	OO
incredible	OO
nanotechnology	OO
in	OO
your	OO

right	OO
now	.O
and	OU
besides	OO
the	OO
obvious	OO
benefit	OO
of	OO
being	OO
able	OO
to	OO
place	OO
more	,O
smaller	OO
transistors	OO
on	OO
a	OO
chip	,O
smaller	OO
transistors	OO
are	OO
faster	OO
switches	,O
and	OO
smaller	OO
transistors	OO
are	OO
also	OO
more	OO
efficient	OO

so	OU
this	OO
combination	OO
has	OO
given	OO

lower	OO
cost	,O
higher	OO

and	OO
higher	OO

electronics	OO
that	OO
we	OO
all	OO

to	OU

these	OO

the	OO

built	OO
up	OO

on	OO
a	OO

and	OU
in	OO
an	OO
oversimplified	OO
sense	,O
every	OO

of	OO
the	OO
circuit	OO
is	OO
projected	OO
onto	OO
the	OO
surface	OO
of	OO
the	OO
silicon	OO
wafer	OO
and	OO
recorded	OO
in	OO
a	OO
light	OO

material	OO
and	OO
then	OO
etched	OO
through	OO
the	OO
light	OO
sensitive	OO
material	OO
to	OO
leave	OO
the	OO
pattern	OO
in	OO
the	OO
underlying	OO

and	OU
this	OO

has	OO
been	OO
dramatically	OO
improved	OO
over	OO
the	OO
years	OO
to	OO
give	OO
the	OO
electronics	OO
performance	OO
we	OO
have	OO
today	.O
but	OU
as	OO
the	OO

features	OO
get	OO
smaller	OO
and	OO
smaller	,O
we're	OO
really	OO
approaching	OO
the	OO
physical	OO
limitations	OO
of	OO
this	OO
manufacturing	OO
technique	.O
the	OU
latest	OO
systems	OO
for	OO
doing	OO
this	OO
patterning	OO
have	OO
become	OO
so	OO
complex	OO
that	OO
they	OO
reportedly	OO
cost	OO
more	OO
than	OO
100	OO
million	OO
dollars	OO
each	.O
and	OU
semiconductor	OO
factories	OO
contain	OO
dozens	OO
of	OO
these	OO
machines	.O
so	OU
people	OO
are	OO
seriously	OO
questioning:	OO
is	OU
this	OO
approach	OO
long	OO
term	OO
viable	?O
but	OU
we	OO
believe	OO
we	OO
can	OO
do	OO
this	OO
chip	OO
manufacturing	OO
in	OO
a	OO
totally	OO
different	OO
and	OO
much	OO
more	OO
cost	OO
effective	OO
way	OO
using	OO
molecular	OO
engineering	OO
and	OO
mimicking	OO
nature	OO
down	OO
at	OO
the	OO
nanoscale	OO
dimensions	OO
of	OO
our	OO
transistors	.O
as	OU
i	OU
said	,O
the	OO
conventional	OO
manufacturing	OO
takes	OO
every	OO
tiny	OO
feature	OO
of	OO
the	OO
circuit	OO
and	OO
projects	OO
it	OO
onto	OO
the	OO
silicon	.O
but	OU
if	OO
you	OO
look	OO
at	OO
the	OO
structure	OO
of	OO
an	OO
integrated	OO
circuit	,O
the	OO
transistor	OO
arrays	,O
many	OO
of	OO
the	OO
features	OO
are	OO
repeated	OO
millions	OO
of	OO
times	.O
it's	OU
a	OO
highly	OO
periodic	OO
structure	.O
so	OU
we	OO
want	OO
to	OO
take	OO
advantage	OO
of	OO
this	OO
periodicity	OO
in	OO
our	OO
alternative	OO
manufacturing	OO
technique	.O
we	OU
want	OO
to	OO
use	OO
self	OO
assembling	OO
materials	OO
to	OO
naturally	OO
form	OO
the	OO
periodic	OO
structures	OO
that	OO
we	OO
need	OO
for	OO
our	OO
transistors	.O
we	OU
do	OO
this	OO
with	OO
the	OO
materials	,O
then	OO
the	OO
materials	OO
do	OO
the	OO
hard	OO
work	OO
of	OO
the	OO
fine	OO
patterning	,O
rather	OO
than	OO
pushing	OO
the	OO
projection	OO
technology	OO
to	OO
its	OO
limits	OO
and	OO
beyond	.O
self	OU
assembly	OO
is	OO
seen	OO
in	OO
nature	OO
in	OO
many	OO
different	OO
places	,O
from	OO
lipid	OO
membranes	OO
to	OO
cell	OO
structures	,O
so	OO
we	OO
do	OO
know	OO
it	OO
can	OO
be	OO
a	OO
robust	OO
solution	.O
if	OU
it's	OO
good	OO
enough	OO
for	OO
nature	,O
it	OO
should	OO
be	OO
good	OO
enough	OO
for	OO
us	.O
so	OU
we	OO
want	OO
to	OO
take	OO
this	OO
naturally	OO
occurring	,O
robust	OO
self	OO
assembly	OO
and	OO
use	OO
it	OO
for	OO
the	OO
manufacturing	OO
of	OO
our	OO
semiconductor	OO
technology	.O
one	OU
type	OO
of	OO
self	OO
assemble	OO
material	OO
—	OO
it's	OO
called	OO
a	OO
block	OO
co	OO
polymer	OO
—	OO
consists	OO
of	OO
two	OO
polymer	OO
chains	OO
just	OO
a	OO
few	OO
tens	OO
of	OO
nanometers	OO
in	OO
length	.O
but	OU
these	OO
chains	OO
hate	OO
each	OO
other	.O
they	OU
repel	OO
each	OO

very	OO
much	OO
like	OO
oil	OO
and	OO
water	OO
or	OO
my	OO
teenage	OO
son	OO
and	OO
daughter	.O
but	OU
we	OO
cruelly	OO
bond	OO
them	OO
together	,O
creating	OO
an	OO
inbuilt	OO
frustration	OO
in	OO
the	OO
system	,O
as	OO
they	OO
try	OO
to	OO
separate	OO
from	OO
each	OO
other	.O
and	OU
in	OO
the	OO
bulk	OO
material	,O
there	OO
are	OO
billions	OO
of	OO
these	,O
and	OO
the	OO
similar	OO

together	,O
and	OO
the	OO
opposing	OO
components	OO
try	OO
to	OO
separate	OO
from	OO
each	OO
other	OO
at	OO
the	OO
same	OO
time	.O
and	OU
this	OO
has	OO
a	OO
built	OO
in	OO
frustration	,O
a	OO
tension	OO
in	OO
the	OO
system	.O
so	OU
it	OO
moves	OO
around	,O
it	OO
squirms	OO
until	OO
a	OO
shape	OO
is	OO
formed	.O
and	OU
the	OO
natural	OO
self	OO
assembled	OO
shape	OO
that	OO
is	OO
formed	OO
is	OO
nanoscale	,O
it's	OO
regular	,O
it's	OO
periodic	,O
and	OO
it's	OO
long	OO
range	,O
which	OO
is	OO
exactly	OO
what	OO
we	OO
need	OO
for	OO
our	OO
transistor	OO
arrays	.O
so	OU
we	OO
can	OO
use	OO
molecular	OO
engineering	OO
to	OO
design	OO
different	OO
shapes	OO
of	OO
different	OO
sizes	OO
and	OO
of	OO
different	OO
periodicities	.O
so	OU
for	OO
example	,O
if	OO
we	OO
take	OO
a	OO
symmetrical	OO
molecule	,O
where	OO
the	OO
two	OO
polymer	OO
chains	OO
are	OO
similar	OO
length	,O
the	OO
natural	OO
self	OO
assembled	OO
structure	OO
that	OO
is	OO
formed	OO
is	OO
a	OO
long	,O
meandering	OO
line	,O
very	OO
much	OO
like	OO
a	OO
fingerprint	.O
and	OU
the	OO
width	OO
of	OO
the	OO
fingerprint	OO
lines	OO
and	OO
the	OO
distance	OO
between	OO
them	OO
is	OO
determined	OO
by	OO
the	OO
lengths	OO
of	OO
our	OO
polymer	OO
chains	OO
but	OO
also	OO
the	OO
level	OO
of	OO
built	OO
in	OO
frustration	OO
in	OO
the	OO
system	.O
and	OU
we	OO
can	OO
even	OO
create	OO
more	OO
elaborate	OO
structures	OO
if	OO
we	OO
use	OO
unsymmetrical	OO
molecules	,O
where	OO
one	OO
polymer	OO
chain	OO
is	OO
significantly	OO
shorter	OO
than	OO
the	OO
other	.O
and	OU
the	OO
self	OO
assembled	OO
structure	OO
that	OO
forms	OO
in	OO
this	OO
case	OO
is	OO
with	OO
the	OO
shorter	OO
chains	OO
forming	OO
a	OO
tight	OO
ball	OO
in	OO
the	OO
middle	,O
and	OO
it's	OO
surrounded	OO
by	OO
the	OO
longer	,O
opposing	OO
polymer	OO
chains	,O
forming	OO
a	OO
natural	OO
cylinder	.O
and	OU
the	OO
size	OO
of	OO
this	OO
cylinder	OO
and	OO
the	OO
distance	OO
between	OO
the	OO
cylinders	,O
the	OO
periodicity	,O
is	OO
again	OO
determined	OO
by	OO
how	OO
long	OO
we	OO
make	OO
the	OO
polymer	OO
chains	OO
and	OO
the	OO
level	OO
of	OO
built	OO
in	OO
frustration	.O
so	OU
in	OO
other	OO
words	,O
we're	OO
using	OO
molecular	OO
engineering	OO
to	OO
self	OO
assemble	OO
nanoscale	OO
structures	OO
that	OO
can	OO
be	OO
lines	OO
or	OO
cylinders	OO
the	OO
size	OO
and	OO
periodicity	OO
of	OO
our	OO
design	.O
we're	OU
using	OO
chemistry	,O
chemical	OO
engineering	,O
to	OO
manufacture	OO
the	OO
nanoscale	OO
features	OO
that	OO
we	OO
need	OO
for	OO
our	OO
transistors	.O
but	OU
the	OO
ability	OO
to	OO
self	OO
assemble	OO
these	OO
structures	OO
only	OO
takes	OO
us	OO
half	OO
of	OO
the	OO
way	,O
because	OO
we	OO
still	OO
need	OO
to	OO
position	OO
these	OO
structures	OO
where	OO
we	OO
want	OO
the	OO
transistors	OO
in	OO
the	OO
integrated	OO
circuit	.O
but	OU
we	OO
can	OO
do	OO
this	OO
relatively	OO
easily	OO
using	OO
wide	OO
guide	OO
structures	OO
that	OO
pin	OO
down	OO
the	OO
self	OO
assembled	OO
structures	,O
anchoring	OO
them	OO
in	OO
place	OO
and	OO
forcing	OO
the	OO
rest	OO
of	OO
the	OO
self	OO
assembled	OO
structures	OO
to	OO
lie	OO
parallel	,O
aligned	OO
with	OO
our	OO
guide	OO
structure	.O
for	OU
example	,O
if	OO
we	OO
want	OO
to	OO
make	OO
a	OO
fine	,O
40	OO
nanometer	OO
line	,O
which	OO
is	OO
very	OO
difficult	OO
to	OO
manufacture	OO
with	OO
conventional	OO
projection	OO
technology	,O
we	OO
can	OO
manufacture	OO
a	OO
120	OO
nanometer	OO
guide	OO
structure	OO
with	OO
normal	OO
projection	OO
technology	,O
and	OO
this	OO
structure	OO
will	OO
align	OO
three	OO
of	OO
the	OO
40	OO
nanometer	OO
lines	OO
in	OO
between	.O
so	OU
the	OO
materials	OO
are	OO
doing	OO
the	OO
most	OO
difficult	OO
fine	OO
patterning	.O
and	OU
we	OO
call	OO
this	OO
whole	OO
approach	OO
directed	OO
self	OO
assembly	.O
the	OU
challenge	OO
with	OO
directed	OO
self	OO
assembly	OO
is	OO
that	OO
the	OO
whole	OO
system	OO
needs	OO
to	OO
align	OO
almost	OO
perfectly	,O
because	OO
any	OO
tiny	OO
defect	OO
in	OO
the	OO
structure	OO
could	OO
cause	OO
a	OO
transistor	OO
failure	.O
and	OU
because	OO
there	OO
are	OO
billions	OO
of	OO
transistors	OO
in	OO
our	OO
circuit	,O
we	OO
need	OO
an	OO
almost	OO
molecularly	OO
perfect	OO
system	.O
but	OU
we're	OO
going	OO
to	OO
extraordinary	OO
measures	OO
to	OO
achieve	OO
this	,O
from	OO
the	OO
cleanliness	OO
of	OO
our	OO
chemistry	OO
to	OO
the	OO
careful	OO
processing	OO
of	OO
these	OO
materials	OO
in	OO
the	OO
semiconductor	OO
factory	OO
to	OO
remove	OO
even	OO
the	OO
smallest	OO
nanoscopic	OO
defects	.O
so	OU
directed	OO
self	OO
assembly	OO
is	OO
an	OO
exciting	OO
new	OO
disruptive	OO
technology	,O
but	OO
it	OO
is	OO
still	OO
in	OO
the	OO
development	OO
stage	.O
but	OU
we're	OO
growing	OO
in	OO
confidence	OO
that	OO
we	OO
could	,O
in	OO

introduce	OO
it	OO
to	OO
the	OO

as	OO
a	OO
revolutionary	OO
new	OO

in	OO
just	OO

if	OO
we	OO

whole	OO
week	OO
off	OO
to	OO
allow	OO
the	OO
military	OO
to	OO
count	OO
it	.O
i	OU
come	OO
from	OO
togo	,U
by	OO
the	OO
way	.O
it	OU
is	OO
a	OO
beautiful	OO
country	OO
located	OO
in	OO
west	OU
africa	.U
there	OU
are	OO
some	OO
cool	,O
interesting	OO
facts	OO
about	OO
my	OO
country	.O
togo	OU
has	OO
been	OO
ruled	OO
by	OO
the	OO
same	OO
family	OO
for	OO
51	OO
years	,O
making	OO
us	OO
the	OO
oldest	OO
autocracy	OO
in	OO
africa	.U
that's	OU
a	OO
record	.O
we	OU
have	OO
a	OO
second	OO
coolest	OO
record:	OO
we	OO
have	OO
been	OO
ranked	OO
three	OO
times	OO
as	OO
the	OO
unhappiest	OO
country	OO
on	OO
earth	.O
you	OU
are	OO
all	OO
invited	.O
so	OU
just	OO
to	OO
let	OO
you	OO
know	,O
it's	OO
not	OO
very	OO
cool	OO
to	OO
live	OO
under	OO
an	OO
autocracy	.O
but	OU
the	OO
interesting	OO
thing	OO
is	OO
that	OO
i	OU
have	OO
met	,O
throughout	OO
the	OO
course	OO
of	OO
my	OO
activism	,O
so	OO
many	OO
people	OO
from	OO
different	OO
countries	,O
and	OO
when	OO
i	OU
tell	OO
them	OO
about	OO
togo	,U
their	OO
reaction	OO
is	OO
always	,O
how	OU
can	OO
you	OO
guys	OO
allow	OO
the	OO
same	OO
people	OO
to	OO
terrorize	OO
you	OO
for	OO
51	OO
years	?O
you	OU
know	,O
like	,O
you	OO
togolese	,U
you	OO
must	OO
be	OO
very	OO
patient	.O
that's	OU
their	OO
diplomatic	OO
way	OO
of	OO
saying	OO
stupid	.O
and	OU
when	OO
you	OO
live	OO
in	OO
a	OO
free	OO
country	,O
there's	OO
this	OO
tendency	OO
of	OO
assuming	OO
that	OO
those	OO
who	OO
are	OO
oppressed	OO
tolerate	OO
their	OO
oppression	OO
or	OO
are	OO
comfortable	OO
with	OO
it	,O
and	OO
democracy	OO
is	OO
projected	OO
as	OO
a	OO
progressive	OO
form	OO
of	OO
governance	OO
in	OO
such	OO
a	OO
way	OO
that	OO
those	OO
people	OO
who	OO
don't	OO
live	OO
under	OO
democratic	OO
countries	OO
are	OO
seen	OO
as	OO
people	OO
who	OO
are	OO
not	OO
intellectually	OO
or	OO
maybe	OO
morally	OO
as	OO
advanced	OO
as	OO
others	.O
but	OU
it's	OO
not	OO
the	OO
case	.O
the	OU
reason	OO
why	OO
people	OO
have	OO
that	OO
perception	OO
has	OO
to	OO
do	OO
with	OO
the	OO
way	OO
stories	OO
are	OO
covered	OO
about	OO
dictatorships	.O
in	OU
the	OO
course	OO
of	OO
my	OO
activism	,O
i	OU
have	OO
had	OO
to	OO
interview	OO
with	OO
so	OO
many	OO
news	OO
outlets	OO
out	OO
there	,O
and	OO
usually	OO
it	OO
would	OO
always	OO
start	OO
with	,O
what	OU
got	OO
you	OO
started	?O
what	OU
inspired	OO
you	?O
and	OU
i	OU
reply	,O
i	OU
wasn't	OO
inspired	.O
i	OU
was	OO
triggered	.O
and	OU
it	OO
goes	OO
on	.O
well	,U
what	OO
triggered	OO
you	?O
and	OU
i	OU
go	OO
on	OO
about	OO
how	OO
my	OO
father	OO
was	OO
arrested	OO
when	OO
i	OU
was	OO
13	,O
and	OO
tortured	,O
all	OO
the	OO
history	.O
i	OU
don't	OO
want	OO
to	OO
get	OO
into	OO
details	OO
now	,O
because	OO
you'll	OO
start	OO
sleeping	.O
but	OU
the	OO
thing	OO
is	,O
at	OO
the	OO
end	OO
of	OO
the	OO
day	,O
what	OO
interests	OO
them	OO
the	OO
most	OO
is:	OO
how	OU
was	OO
he	OO
tortured	?O
for	OU
how	OO
many	OO
days	?O
how	OU
many	OO
people	OO
died	?O
they	OU
are	OO
interested	OO
in	OO
the	OO
abuse	,O
in	OO
the	OO
killing	,O
because	OO
they	OO
believe	OO
that	OO
will	OO
gain	OO
attention	OO
and	OO
sympathy	.O
but	OU
in	OO
reality	,O
it	OO
serves	OO
the	OO
purpose	OO
of	OO
the	OO
dictator	.O
it	OU
helps	OO
them	OO
advertise	OO
their	OO
cruelty	.O
in	OU
2011	,O
i	OU
cofounded	OO
a	OO
movement	OO
i	OU
call	OO
faure	OU
must	OU
go	,U
because	OO
faure	OU
is	OO
the	OO
first	OO
name	OO
of	OO
our	OO
president	.O
togo	OU
is	OO
a	OO
french	OU
speaking	OO
country	,O
by	OO
the	OO
way	,O
but	OO
i	OU
chose	OO
english	OU
because	OO
i	OU
had	OO
my	OO
issues	OO
with	OO
france	OU
as	OO
well	.O
but	OU
then	OO
—	OO
but	OU
then	,O
when	OO
i	OU
started	OO
faure	OU
must	OU
go	,U
i	OU
made	OO
a	OO
video	,O
and	OO
i	OU
came	OO
on	OO
camera	,O
and	OO
i	OU
said	,O
well	,U
faure	OU
gnassingbé	,U
i	OU
give	OO
you	OO
60	OO
days	OO
to	OO
resign	OO
as	OO
president	,O
because	OO
if	OO
you	OO
don't	,O
we	OO
the	OO
youth	OO
in	OO
togo	OU
will	OO
organize	OO
and	OO
we	OO
will	OO
bring	OO
you	OO
down	,O
because	OO
you	OO
have	OO
killed	OO
over	OO
500	OO
of	OO
our	OO
countrymen	OO
to	OO
seize	OO
power	OO
when	OO
your	OO
father	OO

we	OU

not	OO
chosen	OO
you	.O
you	OU
are	OO
an	OO
imposter	,O
and	OO
we	OO
will	OO
remove	OO
you	.O
but	OU
i	OU
was	OO
the	OO
only	OO
known	OO
face	OO
of	OO
the	OO
movement	.O
why	?U
because	OU
i	OU
was	OO
the	OO
only	OO
stupid	OO
one	.O
and	OU
the	OO
backlashes	OO
followed	.O
my	OU
family	OO
started	OO
receiving	OO
threats	.O
my	OU
siblings	OO
called	OO
me	OO
one	OO
morning	.O
they	OU
said	,O
you	OU
know	OO
what	?O
when	OU
they	OO
come	OO
here	OO
to	OO
kill	OO
you	,O
we	OO
don't	OO
want	OO
to	OO
die	OO
with	OO
you	,O
so	OO
move	OO
out	.O
so	OU
yes	,O
i	OU
moved	OO
out	.O
and	OU
i'm	OU
so	OO
angry	OO
at	OO
them	,O
so	OO
i	OU
haven't	OO
talked	OO
to	OO
them	OO
in	OO
five	OO
years	.O
anyway	,U
moving	OO
forward	.O
for	OU
the	OO
past	OO
nine	OO
years	,O
i	OU
have	OO
been	OO
working	OO
with	OO
countries	OO
to	OO
raise	OO
awareness	OO
of	OO
togo	,U
to	OO
help	OO
the	OO
people	OO
of	OO
togo	OU
overcome	OO
their	OO
fear	OO
so	OO
they	,O
too	,O
can	OO
come	OO
and	OO
say	OO
they	OO
want	OO
change	.O
i	OU
have	OO
received	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
persecution	OO
that	OO
i	OU
cannot	OO
disclose	,O
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
threats	,O
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
abuse	,O
psychologically	.O
but	OU
i	OU
don't	OO
like	OO
talking	OO
about	OO
them	,O
because	OO
i	OU
know	OO
that	OO
my	OO
job	OO
as	OO
an	OO
activist	OO
is	OO
to	OO
mobilize	,O
is	OO
to	OO
organize	,O
is	OO
to	OO
help	OO
every	OO
single	OO
togolese	OU
citizen	OO
understand	OO
that	,O
as	OO
citizens	,O
we	OO
hold	OO
the	OO
power	,O
we	OO
are	OO
the	OO
boss	OO
and	OO
we	OO
decide	.O
and	OU
the	OO
punishment	OO
that	OO
the	OO
dictators	OO
are	OO
using	OO
to	OO
intimidate	OO
them	OO
must	OO
not	OO
prevent	OO
us	OO
from	OO
getting	OO
what	OO
we	OO
want	.O
that	OU
is	OO
why	OO
i	OU
said	OO
it	OO
is	OO
very	OO
important	OO
to	OO
cover	OO
the	OO
stories	OO
of	OO
activists	OO
in	OO
the	OO
way	OO
that	OO
it	OO
helps	OO
mobilize	OO
people	,O
not	OO
in	OO
the	OO
way	OO
that	OO
it	OO
helps	OO
deter	OO
their	OO
action	OO
and	OO
force	OO
even	OO
more	OO
their	OO
subjugation	OO
to	OO
the	OO
oppressive	OO
system	.O
during	OU
these	OO
years	OO
that	OO
i've	OU
been	OO
an	OO
activist	,O
there	OO
are	OO
days	OO
that	OO
i	OU
felt	OO
like	OO
quitting	OO
because	OO
i	OU
couldn't	OO
take	OO
it	.O
well	OU
then	,O
what	OO
kept	OO
me	OO
going	?O
the	OU
one	OO
thing	OO
that	OO
kept	OO
me	OO
going:	OO
i	OU
remember	OO
the	OO
story	OO
of	OO
my	OO
grandfather	,O
and	OO
how	OO
he	OO
used	OO
to	OO
walk	OO
465	OO
miles	OO
from	OO
his	OO
village	OO
to	OO
the	OO
city	,O
just	OO
to	OO
protest	OO
for	OO
independence	.O
then	OU
i	OU
remember	OO
the	OO
sacrifice	OO
of	OO
my	OO
father	,O
who	OO
was	OO
tortured	OO
so	OO
many	OO
times	OO
for	OO
daring	OO
to	OO
protest	OO
against	OO
the	OO
regime	.O
back	OU
in	OO
the	OO
'70s	,O
they	OO
would	OO
write	OO
pamphlets	OO
to	OO
raise	OO
awareness	OO
on	OO
the	OO
dictatorship	,O
and	OO
because	OO
they	OO
couldn't	OO
afford	OO
to	OO
make	OO
copies	,O
they	OO
would	OO
reproduce	OO
the	OO
same	OO
pamphlet	OO
500	OO
times	OO
each	OO
and	OO
distribute	OO
them	.O
it	OU
got	OO
to	OO
a	OO
point	OO
where	OO
the	OO
military	OO
knew	OO
their	OO
handwriting	,O
so	OO
as	OO
soon	OO
as	OO
they	OO
stumbled	OO
upon	OO
one	,O
they'd	OO
go	OO
and	OO
get	OO
them	.O
but	OU
i	OU
look	OO
at	OO
that	OO
and	OO
i'm	OU
like	,O
you	OO
know	,O
today	OO
you	OO
have	OO
a	OO
blog	.O
i	OU
don't	OO
have	OO
to	OO
copy	OO
the	OO
same	OO
thing	OO
500	OO
times	.O
i	OU
blog	OO
and	OO
thousands	OO
of	OO
people	OO
read	OO
it	.O
by	OU
the	OO
way	,O
in	OO
togo	,U
they	OO
like	OO
calling	OO
me	OO
the	OO
whatsapp	OU
girl	,O
because	OO
i	OU
am	OO
always	OO
on	OO
whatsapp	OU
attacking	OO
the	OO
government	.O
so	OU
it's	OO
much	OO
easier	.O
when	OU
i'm	OU
angry	OO
at	OO
the	OO
government	,O
i	OU
just	OO
make	OO
an	OO
angry	OO
note	,O
and	OO
i	OU
send	OO
it	OO
out	OO
and	OO
thousands	OO
of	OO
people	OO
share	OO
it	.O
i'm	OU
rarely	OO
this	OO
composed	.O
i'm	OU
always	OO
angry	,O
by	OO
the	OO
way	.O
so	OU
i	OU
was	OO
talking	OO
about	OO
the	OO
necessity	OO
to	OO
showcase	OO
our	OO
stories	,O
because	OO
when	OO
i	OU
think	OO
about	OO
the	OO
sacrifices	OO
that	OO
were	OO
made	OO
for	OO
us	,O
it	OO
helped	OO
me	OO
keep	OO
going	.O
one	OU
of	OO
the	OO
very	OO
first	OO
actions	OO
of	OO
our	OO
faure	OU
must	OU
go	OU
movement	OO
was	OO
to	OO
come	OO
up	OO
with	OO
a	OO
petition	,O
asking	OO
citizens	OO
to	OO
sign	OO
so	OO
that	OO
we	OO
can	OO
demand	OO
new	OO
elections	,O
as	OO
the	OO
constitution	OO
allows	.O
people	OU
were	OO
scared	OO
to	OO
put	OO
their	OO
names	OO
because	,O
they	OO
said	,O
they	OO
don't	OO
want	OO
to	OO
get	OO
in	OO
trouble	.O
even	OU
in	OO
the	OO
diaspora	,O
people	OO
were	OO
scared	.O
they	OU
were	OO
like	,O
we	OU
have	OO
family	OO
at	OO
home	.O
but	OU
there	OO
was	OO
this	OO
woman	OO
who	OO
was	OO
in	OO
her	OO
60s	.O
when	OU
she	OO
heard	OO
about	OO
it	,O
she	OO
took	OO
the	OO
petition	,O
and	OO
she	OO
went	OO
home	,O
and	OO
by	OO
herself	OO
she	OO
collected	OO
over	OO
1,000	.O
that	OU
inspired	OO
me	OO
so	OO
much	,O
and	OO
i	OU
was	OO
like	,O
if	OO
a	OO
60	OO
year	OO
old	OO
that	OO
has	OO
nothing	OO
more	OO
to	OO
gain	OO
in	OO
this	OO
regime	OO
can	OO
do	OO
this	OO
for	OO
us	,O
the	OO
young	OO
ones	,O
then	OO
why	OO
should	OO
i	OU
quit	?O
it	OU
is	OO
the	OO
stories	OO
of	OO
resistance	,O
the	OO
stories	OO
of	OO
defiance	,O
the	OO
stories	OO
of	OO
resilience	,O
that	OO
inspire	OO
people	OO
to	OO
get	OO
involved	,O
not	OO
the	OO
stories	OO
of	OO
abuse	OO
and	OO
killings	OO
and	OO
hurt	,O
because	OO
as	OO
humans	,O
it's	OO
only	OO
natural	OO
for	OO
us	OO
to	OO
be	OO
scared	.O
i	OU
would	OO
like	OO
to	OO
share	OO
with	OO
you	OO
a	OO
few	OO
characteristics	OO
of	OO
dictatorships	OO
so	OO
that	OO
you	OO
can	OO
assess	OO
your	OO
own	OO
country	OO
and	OO
see	OO
if	OO
you	OO
are	OO
also	OO
at	OO
risk	OO
of	OO
joining	OO
us	.O
number	OU
one	OO
thing	OO
to	OO
look	OO
at:	OO
concentration	OO
of	OO
power	.O
is	OU
the	OO
power	OO
in	OO
your	OO
country	OO
concentrated	OO
in	OO
the	OO
hands	OO
of	OO
a	OO
few	,O
an	OO
elite	?O
it	OU
can	OO
be	OO
a	OO
political	OO
elite	,O
ideological	OO
elite	.O
and	OU
you	OO
have	OO
a	OO
strongman	,O
because	OO
we	OO
always	OO
have	OO
one	OO
guy	OO
who	OO
is	OO
presented	OO
as	OO
the	OO
messiah	OO
who	OO
will	OO
save	OO
us	OO
from	OO
the	OO
world	.O
the	OU
second	OO
point	OO
is	OO
propaganda	.O
dictators	OU
feed	OO
on	OO
propaganda	.O
they	OU
like	OO
giving	OO
the	OO
impression	OO
that	OO
they	OO
are	OO
the	OO
saviors	,O
and	OO
without	OO
them	,O
the	OO
country	OO
will	OO
fall	OO
apart	.O
and	OU
they	OO
are	OO
always	OO
fighting	OO
some	OO
foreign	OO
forces	,O
you	OO
know	?O
the	OU
christians	,U
the	OO
jewish	,U
the	OO
muslims	,U
the	OO
voodoo	OO
priests	OO
are	OO
coming	OO
for	OO
you	.O
the	OU
communists	,U
when	OO
they	OO
get	OO
here	,O
we'll	OO
all	OO
be	OO
broke	.O
these	OU
kinds	OO
of	OO
things	.O
and	OU
our	OO
president	,O
in	OO
particular	,O
he	OO
fights	OO
pirates	.O
i	OU
am	OO
very	OO
serious	.O
last	OU
year	,O
he	OO
bought	OO
a	OO
boat	OO
that's	OO
13	OO
million	OO
dollars	OO
to	OO
fight	OO
pirates	,O
and	OO
60	OO
percent	OO
of	OO
our	OO
people	OO
are	OO
starving	.O
so	OU
they	OO
are	OO
always	OO
protecting	OO
us	OO
from	OO
some	OO
foreign	OO
forces	.O
and	OU
this	OO
leads	OO
to	OO
point	OO
three:	OO
militarization	.O
dictators	OU
survive	OO
by	OO
instigating	OO
fear	,O
and	OO
they	OO
use	OO
the	OO
military	OO
to	OO
suppress	OO
dissident	OO
voices	,O
even	OO
though	OO
they	OO
try	OO
to	OO
give	OO
the	OO
impression	OO
that	OO
the	OO
military	OO
is	OO
to	OO
protect	OO
the	OO
nation	.O
and	OU
they	OO
suppress	OO
institutions	OO
and	OO
destroy	OO
them	OO
so	OO
that	OO
they	OO
don't	OO
have	OO
to	OO
be	OO
held	OO
accountable	.O
so	OU
do	OO
you	OO
have	OO
a	OO
heavily	OO
militarized	OO
country	?O
and	OU
this	OO
leads	OO
to	OO
point	OO
four	,O
what	OO
i	OU
call	OO
human	OO
cruelty	.O
you	OU
know	OO
when	OO
we	OO
talk	OO
about	OO
animals	,O
we	OO
say	OO
animal	OO
cruelty	OO
when	OO
animals	OO
are	OO
abused	,O
because	OO
there's	OO
no	OO
charter	OO
acknowledged	OO
by	OO
the	OO
un	OU
saying	OO
animal	OO
rights	OO
charter	.O
point	OU
one:	OO
all	OO
animals	OO
are	OO
created	OO
equal	.O
so	OU
you	OO
don't	OO
have	OO
that	.O
so	OU
whenever	OO
animals	OO
are	OO
abused	,O
we	OO
say	OO
animal	OO
cruelty	.O
but	OU
when	OO
it	OO
comes	OO
to	OO
humans	,O
we	OO
say	OO
human	OO
rights	OO
abuses	,O
because	OO
we	OO
assume	OO
that	OO
all	OO
humans	OO
have	OO
rights	.O
but	OU
some	OO
of	OO
us	OO
are	OO
actually	OO
still	OO
fighting	OO
for	OO
our	OO
right	OO
to	OO
have	OO
rights	.O
so	OU
in	OO
that	OO
condition	,O
i	OU
don't	OO
talk	OO
about	OO
human	OO
rights	OO
abuse	OO
or	OO
violation	.O
when	OU
you	OO
live	OO
in	OO
a	OO
country	OO
and	OO
you	OO
have	OO
an	OO
issue	OO
with	OO
the	OO
president	OO
and	OO
the	OO
worst	OO
thing	OO
that	OO
can	OO

we	OU

that	OO

the	OO

the	OU

that's	OO
the	OO
final	OO
thing	OO
that	OO
i	OU
want	OO
to	OO
share	OO
about	OO
autocracies	,O
so	OO
that	OO
you	OO
look	OO
at	OO
your	OO
country	OO
and	OO
see	OO
if	OO
there	OO
are	OO
risks	OO
there	.O
it	OU
is	OO
important	OO
that	OO
you	OO
acknowledge	OO
the	OO
gains	OO
of	OO

that	OO
you	OO

today	,O
because	OO
some	OO

you	OO

it	.O
so	OU

take	OO
this	OO
for	OO

but	OU
then	OO
at	OO
the	OO

you	OO

the	OU

when	OU

it's	OO

the	OO

that	OO

a	OO

an	OO

on	OO
flies	OO

some	OU
small	OO
animals	,O
like	OO
worms	OO

are	OO
also	OO
limited	OO
by	OO
the	OO
mechanics	OO
of	OO
their	OO
cell	OO

they're	OU

made	OO
up	OO
of	OO

that	OO

when	OO

so	OO
their	OO

and	OU
size	OO
is	OO
a	OO
powerful	OO
evolutionary	OO
driver	OO
in	OO
animals	.O
smaller	OU
creatures	OO
are	OO
more	OO
prone	OO
to	OO

a	OU
mouse	,O
for	OO

can	OO
hardly	OO
expect	OO
to	OO
survive	OO
more	OO
than	OO
a	OO
year	OO
in	OO
the	OO

so	,U
it	OO
has	OO
evolved	OO
to	OO
grow	OO

more	OO
rapidly	,O

against	OO

larger	OU
animals	,O
by	OO

are	OO
better	OO
at	OO

off	OO

so	OO
they	OO
have	OO
the	OO
luxury	OO
of	OO

to	OO

but	OO
in	OO
each	OO
case	,O
these	OO
animals	OO
have	OO
other	OO
adaptations	OO
that	OO
allow	OO
them	OO
to	OO
escape	OO

but	OU
there	OO
are	OO
still	OO
cases	OO
where	OO

with	OO
similar	OO

age	OO
at	OO
completely	OO

in	OU
these	OO
cases	,O
genetic	OO
differences	,O
like	OO
how	OO

respond	OO
to	OO

account	OO
for	OO
the	OO

so	OU
it's	OO
the	OO

of	OO
all	OO
these	OO

playing	OO
out	OO
to	OO

now	,O

you	?O
anyhow	,U
let's	OO
take	OO
one	OO
of	OO
the	OO
most	OO
common	OO
sources:	OO
bug	OO
bites	.O
when	OU
a	OO
mosquito	OO
bites	OO
you	,O
it	OO
releases	OO
a	OO
compound	OO
into	OO
your	OO
body	OO
called	OO
an	OO
anticoagulant	OO
that	OO
prevents	OO
your	OO
blood	OO
from	OO
clotting	.O
that	OU
compound	,O
which	OO
we're	OO
mildly	OO
allergic	OO
to	,O
triggers	OO
the	OO
release	OO
of	OO
histamine	,O
a	OO
chemical	OO
that	OO
makes	OO
our	OO
capillaries	OO
swell	.O
this	OU
enables	OO
increased	OO
blood	OO
flow	,O
which	OO
helpfully	OO
accelerates	OO
the	OO
body's	OO
immune	OO
response	OO
to	OO
this	OO
perceived	OO
threat	.O
that	OU
explains	OO
the	OO
swelling	,O
and	OO
it's	OO
the	OO
same	OO
reason	OO
pollen	OO
can	OO
make	OO
your	OO
eyes	OO
puff	OO
up	.O
histamine	OU
also	OO
activates	OO
the	OO
nerves	OO
involved	OO
in	OO
itching	,O
which	OO
is	OO
why	OO
bug	OO
bites	OO
make	OO
you	OO
scratch	.O
but	OU
the	OO
itchy	OO
sensation	OO
itself	OO
isn't	OO
yet	OO
fully	OO
understood	.O
in	OU
fact	,O
much	OO
of	OO
what	OO
we	OO
do	OO
know	OO
comes	OO
from	OO
studying	OO
the	OO
mechanics	OO
of	OO
itching	OO
in	OO
mice	.O
researchers	OU
have	OO
discovered	OO
that	OO
itch	OO
signals	OO
in	OO
their	OO
skin	OO
are	OO
transmitted	OO
via	OO
a	OO
subclass	OO
of	OO
the	OO
nerves	OO
that	OO
are	OO
associated	OO
with	OO
pain	.O
these	OU
dedicated	OO
nerves	OO
produce	OO
a	OO
molecule	OO
called	OO
natriuretic	OO
polypetide	OO
b	,U
which	OO
triggers	OO
a	OO
signal	OO
that's	OO
carried	OO
up	OO
the	OO
spinal	OO
cord	OO
to	OO
the	OO
brain	,O
where	OO
it	OO
creates	OO
the	OO
feeling	OO
of	OO
an	OO
itch	.O
when	OU
we	OO
scratch	,O
the	OO
action	OO
of	OO
our	OO
fingernails	OO
on	OO
the	OO
skin	OO
causes	OO
a	OO
low	OO
level	OO
pain	OO
signal	OO
that	OO
overrides	OO
the	OO
itching	OO
sensation	.O
it's	OU
almost	OO
like	OO
a	OO
distraction	,O
which	OO
creates	OO
the	OO
sensation	OO
of	OO
relief	.O
but	OU
is	OO
there	OO
actually	OO
an	OO
evolutionary	OO
purpose	OO
to	OO
the	OO
itch	,O
or	OO
is	OO
it	OO
simply	OO
there	OO
to	OO
annoy	OO
us	?O
the	OU
leading	OO
theory	OO
is	OO
that	OO
our	OO
skin	OO
has	OO
evolved	OO
to	OO
be	OO
acutely	OO
aware	OO
of	OO
touch	OO
so	OO
that	OO
we're	OO
equipped	OO
to	OO
deal	OO
with	OO
risks	OO
from	OO
the	OO
outside	OO
world	.O
think	OU
about	OO
it	.O
our	OU
automatic	OO
scratching	OO
response	OO
would	OO
dislodge	OO
anything	OO
harmful	OO
that's	OO
potentially	OO
lurking	OO
on	OO
our	OO
skin	,O
like	OO
a	OO
harmful	OO
sting	,O
a	OO
biting	OO
insect	,O
or	OO
the	OO
tendrils	OO
of	OO
a	OO
poisonous	OO
plant	.O
this	OU
might	OO
explain	OO
why	OO
we	OO
don't	OO
feel	OO
itching	OO
inside	OO
our	OO
bodies	,O
like	OO
in	OO
our	OO

which	OO
is	OO

from	OO

that	OO

in	OU
some	OO
people	,O

in	OO
the	OO

for	OO

one	OU

scurrying	OO
over	OO

them	OO

incessantly	.O
another	OU
phenomenon	OO

itching	OO
can	OO
occur	OO
in	OO

it	OO
confuses	OO
the	OO

we	OU

so	,U
we	OO
do	OO
a	OO

a	OO

for	OO

why	OO

if	OU

we	OO

either	OO

as	OO

depending	OO
on	OO
the	OO

that	OO

one	OU
of	OO
the	OO
weirdest	OO
things	OO
about	OO

is	OO
that	OO
we	OO
can't	OO
exactly	OO

where	OO
they	OO
are	.O
it's	OU
not	OO
that	OO
we	OO
don't	OO
have	OO
the	OO
equipment	,O
it's	OO
that	OO
this	OO
uncertainty	OO
is	OO
part	OO
of	OO
our	OO
model	OO
of	OO
the	OO
electron	.O
so	,U
we	OO
can't	OO
pinpoint	OO
them	,O
fine	.O
but	OU
we	OO
can	OO
say	OO
there's	OO
a	OO
certain	OO
probability	OO
of	OO
finding	OO
an	OO
electron	OO
in	OO
a	OO
given	OO
space	OO
around	OO
the	OO
nucleus	.O
and	OU
that	OO
means	OO
that	OO
we	OO
can	OO
ask	OO
the	OO
following	OO
question:	OO
if	OU
we	OO
drew	OO
a	OO
shape	OO
around	OO
the	OO
nucleus	OO
such	OO
that	OO
we	OO
would	OO
be	OO
95%	OO
sure	OO
of	OO
finding	OO
a	OO
given	OO
electron	OO
within	OO
that	OO
shape	,O
what	OO
would	OO
it	OO
look	OO
like	?O
here	OU
are	OO
a	OO
few	OO
of	OO
these	OO
shapes	.O
chemists	OU
call	OO
them	OO
orbitals	,O
and	OO
what	OO
each	OO
one	OO
looks	OO
like	OO
depends	OO
on	,O
among	OO
other	OO
things	,O
how	OO
much	OO
energy	OO
it	OO
has	.O
the	OU
more	OO
energy	OO
an	OO
orbital	OO
has	,O
the	OO
farther	OO
most	OO
of	OO
its	OO
density	OO
is	OO
from	OO
the	OO
nucleus	.O
by	OU
they	OO
way	,O
why	OO
did	OO
we	OO
pick	OO
95%	OO
and	OO
not	OO
100%	?O
well	,U
that's	OO
another	OO
quirk	OO
of	OO
our	OO
model	OO
of	OO
the	OO
electron	.O
past	OU
a	OO
certain	OO
distance	OO
from	OO
the	OO
nucleus	,O
the	OO
probability	OO
of	OO
finding	OO
an	OO
electron	OO
starts	OO
to	OO
decrease	OO
more	OO
or	OO
less	OO
exponentially	,O
which	OO
means	OO
that	OO
while	OO
it	OO
will	OO
approach	OO
zero	,O
it'll	OO
never	OO
actually	OO
hit	OO
zero	.O
so	,U
in	OO
every	OO
atom	,O
there	OO
is	OO
some	OO
small	,O
but	OO
non	OO
zero	,O
probability	OO
that	OO
for	OO
a	OO
very	,O
very	OO
short	OO
period	OO
of	OO
time	,O
one	OO
of	OO
its	OO
electrons	OO
is	OO
at	OO
the	OO
other	OO
end	OO
of	OO
the	OO
known	OO
universe	.O
but	OU
mostly	OO
electrons	OO
stay	OO
close	OO
to	OO
their	OO

as	OO
clouds	OO

with	OO

how	OU

things:	OO

a	OO

amongst	OO

such	OO

as	OO
the	OO

a	OO
four	OO

or	OO
potentially	OO
misleading	OO
statements	OO
like	,O

have	OO
a	OO

the	OO

heart	OO

it	OO
to	OO
the	OO

and	OO
then	OO
back	OO
to	OO
the	OO
first	OO
pump	.O
that's	OU
an	OO
important	OO
difference	OO
because	OO
it	OO
marks	OO
two	OO
completely	OO
different	OO

this	OU
confusion	OO
makes	OO
many	OO

wary	OO
of	OO
the	OO

in	OO

thinking	OO
it	OO
signals	OO
an	OO

subject	OO
full	OO
of	OO

names	OO
and	OO
diagrams	.O
only	OU
those	OO
who	OO
end	OO
up	OO
studying	OO
medicine	OO
compeltely	OO
understand	OO
how	OO
it	OO
all	OO
actually	OO
works	.O
that's	OU
when	OO
its	OO
functions	OO
become	OO
apparent	OO
as	OO
medics	OO
get	OO
to	OO
observe	OO
the	OO
motion	OO
of	OO
the	OO
heart's	OO
valves	.O
so	,U
let's	OO
imagine	OO
you're	OO
a	OO
medic	OO
for	OO
a	OO
day	.O
what	OU
you'll	OO
need	OO
to	OO
get	OO
started	OO
is	OO
a	OO
whole	OO
fresh	OO
heart	,O
like	OO
one	OO
from	OO
a	OO
sheep	OO
or	OO
pig	.O
immerse	OU
this	OO
heart	OO
in	OO
water	OO
and	OO
you'll	OO
see	OO
that	OO
it	OO
doesn't	OO
pump	OO
when	OO
squeezed	OO
by	OO
hand	.O
that's	OU
because	OO
water	OO
doesn't	OO
enter	OO
the	OO
heart	OO
cleanly	OO
enough	OO
for	OO
the	OO
pumping	OO
mechanism	OO
to	OO
work	.O
we	OU
can	OO
solve	OO
this	OO
problem	OO
in	OO
an	OO
extraordinarly	OO
simple	OO
way	.O
simply	OU
identify	OO
the	OO
two	OO
atria	OO
and	OO
cut	OO
them	OO
off	,O
trimming	OO
them	OO
down	OO
to	OO
the	OO
tops	OO
of	OO
the	OO
ventricles	.O
this	OU
makes	OO
the	OO
heart	OO
look	OO
less	OO
complicated	OO
because	OO
the	OO
atria	OO
have	OO
several	OO
incoming	OO
veins	OO
attached	.O
so	OU
without	OO
them	OO
there	,O
the	OO
only	OO
vessels	OO
remaining	OO
are	OO
the	OO
two	OO
major	OO
heart	OO
arteries:	OO
the	OO
aorta	OO
and	OO
pulmonary	OO
artery	,O
which	OO
rise	OO
like	OO
white	OO
columns	OO
from	OO
between	OO
the	OO
ventricles	.O
it	OU
looks	OO
—	OO
and	OO
really	OO
is	OO
—	OO
very	OO
simple	.O
if	OU
you	OO
run	OO
water	OO
into	OO
the	OO
right	OO
ventricle	OO
from	OO
a	OO
tap	OO
	,O
you'll	OO
see	OO
that	OO
the	OO
ventricular	OO
valve	OO
tries	OO
to	OO
close	OO
against	OO
the	OO
incoming	OO
stream	.O
and	OU
then	OO
ventricle	OO
inflates	OO
with	OO
water	.O
squeeze	OU
the	OO
ventricle	OO
and	OO
a	OO
stream	OO
of	OO
water	OO
squirts	OO
out	OO
of	OO
the	OO
pulmonary	OO
artery	.O
the	OU
ventricular	OO
valves	,O
called	OO
the	OO
tricuspid	OO
in	OO
the	OO
right	OO
ventricle	OO
and	OO
the	OO
mitral	OO
in	OO
the	OO
left	,O
can	OO
be	OO
seen	OO
through	OO
the	OO
clear	OO
water	OO
opening	OO
and	OO
closing	OO
like	OO
parachutes	OO
as	OO
the	OO
ventricle	OO
is	OO
rhythmically	OO
squeezed	.O
this	OU
flow	OO
of	OO
water	OO
mimics	OO
the	OO
flow	OO
of	OO
blood	OO
in	OO
life	.O
the	OU
valves	OO
are	OO
completely	OO
efficient	.O
you'll	OU
notice	OO
they	OO
don't	OO
leak	OO
at	OO
all	OO
when	OO
the	OO
ventricles	OO
are	OO
squeezed	.O
over	OU
time	,O
they	OO
also	OO
close	OO
against	OO
each	OO
other	OO
with	OO
very	OO
little	OO
wear	OO
and	OO
tear	,O
which	OO
explains	OO
how	OO
this	OO
mechanism	OO
continues	OO
to	OO
work	OO
seamlessly	OO
for	OO
more	OO
than	OO
2	OO
billion	OO
beats	OO
a	OO
heart	OO
gives	OO
in	OO
its	OO
lifetime	.O
now	,U
anyone	OO
studying	OO
the	OO
heart	OO
can	OO
hold	OO
one	OO
in	OO
their	OO
hands	,O
make	OO
it	OO
pump	OO
for	OO
real	OO
and	OO
watch	OO
the	OO
action	OO
unfold	.O
so	OU
place	OO
your	OO
hand	OO
above	OO
your	OO

and	OO
feel	OO
its	OO
rhymic	OO
beat	.O
understanding	OU
how	OO
this	OO
dependable	OO
inner	OO
pump	OO
works	OO
gives	OO
new	OO
resonance	OO
to	OO
the	OO
feeling	OO
you	OO
get	OO
when	OO
you	OO
run	OO
a	OO
race	,O

too	OO
much	OO
caffeine	OO
or	OO
catch	OO
the	OO

of	OO
the	OO
one	OO
you	OO
love	.O
light:	OU
it's	OO
the	OO
fastest	OO
thing	OO
in	OO
the	OO
universe	,O
but	OO
we	OO
can	OO
still	OO
measure	OO
its	OO
speed	OO
if	OO
we	OO
slow	OO
down	OO
the	OO
animation	,O
we	OO
can	OO
analyze	OO
light's	OO
motion	OO
using	OO
a	OO
space	OO
time	OO
diagram	,O
which	OO
takes	OO
a	OO
flipbook	OO
of	OO
animation	OO
panels	,O
and	OO
turns	OO
them	OO
on	OO
their	OO
side	.O
in	OU
this	OO
lesson	,O
we'll	OO
add	OO
the	OO
single	OO
experimental	OO
fact	OO
that	OO
whenever	OO
anyone	OO
measures	OO
just	OO
how	OO
fast	OO
light	OO
moves	,O
they	OO
get	OO
the	OO
same	OO
answer:	OO
299,792,458	OO
meters	OO
every	OO
second	,O
which	OO
means	OO
that	OO
when	OO
we	OO
draw	OO
light	OO
on	OO
our	OO
space	OO
time	OO
diagram	,O
it's	OO
world	OO
line	OO
always	OO
has	OO
to	OO
appear	OO
at	OO
the	OO
same	OO
angle	.O
but	OU
we	OO
saw	OO
previously	OO
that	OO
speed	,O
or	OO
equivalently	OO
world	OO
line	OO
angles	,O
change	OO
when	OO
we	OO
look	OO
at	OO
things	OO
from	OO
other	OO
people's	OO
perspective	.O
to	OU
explore	OO
this	OO
contradiction	,O
let's	OO
see	OO
what	OO
happens	OO
if	OO
i	OU
start	OO
moving	OO
while	OO
i	OU
stand	OO
still	OO
and	OO
shine	OO
the	OO
laser	OO
at	OO
tom	.U
first	,U
we'll	OO
need	OO
to	OO
construct	OO
the	OO
space	OO
time	OO
diagram	.O
yes	,U
that	OO
means	OO
taking	OO
all	OO
of	OO
the	OO
different	OO
panels	OO
showing	OO
the	OO
different	OO
moments	OO
in	OO
time	OO
and	OO
stacking	OO
them	OO
up	.O
from	OU
the	OO
side	,O
we	OO
see	OO
the	OO
world	OO
line	OO
of	OO
the	OO
laser	OO
light	OO
at	OO
its	OO
correct	OO
fixed	OO
angle	,O
just	OO
as	OO
before	.O
so	OU
far	,O
so	OO
good	.O
but	OU
that	OO
space	OO
time	OO
diagram	OO
represents	OO
andrew's	OU
perspective	.O
what	OU
does	OO
it	OO
look	OO
like	OO
to	OO
me	?O
in	OU
the	OO
last	OO
lesson	,O
we	OO
showed	OO
how	OO
to	OO
get	OO
tom's	OU
perspective	OO
moving	OO
all	OO
the	OO
panels	OO
along	OO
a	OO
bit	OO
until	OO
his	OO
world	OO
line	OO
is	OO
completely	OO
vertical	.O
but	OU
look	OO
carefully	OO
at	OO
the	OO
light	OO
world	OO
line	.O
the	OU
rearrangement	OO
of	OO
the	OO
panels	OO
means	OO
it's	OO
now	OO
tilted	OO
over	OO
too	OO
far	.O
i'd	OU
measure	OO
light	OO
traveling	OO
faster	OO
than	OO
andrew	OU
would	.O
but	OU
every	OO
experiment	OO
we've	OO
ever	OO
done	,O
and	OO
we've	OO
tried	OO
very	OO
hard	,O
says	OO
that	OO
everyone	OO
measures	OO
light	OO
to	OO
have	OO
a	OO
fixed	OO
speed	.O
so	OU
let's	OO
start	OO
again	.O
in	OU
the	OO
1900s	,O
a	OO
clever	OO
chap	OO
named	OO
albert	OU
einstein	OU
worked	OO
out	OO
how	OO
to	OO
see	OO
things	OO
properly	,O
from	OO
tom's	OU
point	OO
of	OO
view	,O
while	OO
still	OO
getting	OO
the	OO
speed	OO
of	OO
light	OO
right	.O
first	,U
we	OO
need	OO
to	OO
glue	OO
together	OO
the	OO
separate	OO
panels	OO
into	OO
one	OO
solid	OO
block	.O
this	OU
gives	OO
us	OO
our	OO
space	OO
time	,O
turning	OO
space	OO
and	OO
time	OO
into	OO
one	OO
smooth	,O
continuous	OO
material	.O
and	OU
now	,O
here	OO
is	OO
the	OO
trick	.O
what	OU
you	OO
do	OO
is	OO
stretch	OO
your	OO
block	OO
of	OO
space	OO
time	OO
along	OO
the	OO
light	OO
world	OO
line	,O
then	OO
squash	OO
it	OO
by	OO
the	OO
same	OO
amount	,O
but	OO
at	OO
right	OO
angles	OO
to	OO
the	OO
light	OO
world	OO
line	,O
and	OO
abracadabra	.O
tom's	OU
world	OO
line	OO
has	OO
gone	OO
vertical	,O
so	OO
this	OO
does	OO
represent	OO
the	OO
world	OO
from	OO
his	OO
point	OO
of	OO
view	,O
but	OO
most	OO
importantly	,O
the	OO
light	OO
world	OO
line	OO
has	OO
never	OO
changed	OO
its	OO
angle	,O
and	OO
so	OO
light	OO
will	OO
be	OO
measured	OO
by	OO
tom	OU
going	OO
at	OO
the	OO
correct	OO
speed	.O
this	OU
superb	OO
trick	OO
is	OO
known	OO
as	OO
a	OO
lorentz	OU
transformation	.O
yeah	,U
more	OO
than	OO
a	OO
trick	.O
slice	OU
up	OO
the	OO
space	OO
time	OO
into	OO
new	OO
panels	OO
and	OO
you	OO
have	OO
the	OO
physically	OO
correct	OO
animation	.O
i'm	OU
stationary	OO
in	OO
the	OO
car	,O
everything	OO
else	OO
is	OO
coming	OO
past	OO
me	OO
and	OO
the	OO
speed	OO
of	OO
light	OO
works	OO
out	OO
to	OO
be	OO
that	OO
same	OO
fixed	OO
value	OO
that	OO
we	OO
know	OO
everyone	OO
measures	.O
on	OU
the	OO
other	OO
hand	,O
something	OO
strange	OO
has	OO
happened	.O
the	OU
fence	OO
posts	OO
aren't	OO

a	OO

anymore	,O
and	OO
my	OO

will	OO
be	OO
worried	OO
that	OO
i	OU
look	OO
a	OO

thin	.O
but	OU
that's	OO
not	OO
fair	.O
why	OU
don't	OO
i	OU
get	OO
to	OO

i	OU
thought	OO
physics	OO
was	OO
supposed	OO
to	OO
be	OO
the	OO
same	OO
for	OO
everyone	.O
yes	,U
no	,O
it	OO
is	,O
and	OO
you	OO
do	.O
all	OU
that	OO
stretching	OO
and	OO
squashing	OO
of	OO
space	OO
time	OO
has	OO
just	OO
muddled	OO
together	OO
what	OO
we	OO
used	OO
to	OO
think	OO
of	OO
separately	OO
as	OO
space	OO
and	OO
time	.O
this	OU
particular	OO
squashing	OO

okay	,U
but	OO
i	OU
still	OO
don't	OO
look	OO
thin	.O
no	,U
yes	,O
you	OO
do	.O
now	OU
that	OO
we	OO
know	OO
better	OO
about	OO

we	OO
should	OO

what	OO
the	OO

to	OU
you	,O

you	,O

uh	,U
well	,O
at	OO

it's	OO

and	OU

with	OO
the	OO

starting	OO
over	OO

60	OO
years	.O
why	OU
60	OO
and	OO
not	OO
twelve	?O
well	,U
the	OO
traditional	OO

is	OO
made	OO
up	OO
of	OO
two	OO

systems	.O
the	OU
animals	OO
of	OO
the	OO

are	OO
associated	OO
with	OO
what's	OO
called	OO
the	OO
twelve	OU
earthly	OU
branches	,U
or	OO
shí'èrzhī	.O
another	OU
system	,O
the	OO
ten	OU
heavenly	OU
stems	,U
or	OO
tiāngān	,O
is	OO
linked	OO
with	OO
the	OO
five	OO
classical	OO
elements	OO
of	OO
metal	,O
xīn	,O
wood	,O
mù	,O
water	,O
shuǐ	,O
fire	,O
huǒ	,O
and	OO
earth	,O
tǔ	.O
each	OU
element	OO
is	OO
assigned	OO
yīn	OO
or	OO
yáng	,O
creating	OO
a	OO
ten	OO
year	OO
cycle	.O
when	OU
the	OO
twelve	OO
animals	OO
of	OO
the	OO
earthly	OU
branches	OU
are	OO
matched	OO
with	OO
the	OO
five	OO
elements	OO
plus	OO
the	OO
yīn	OO
or	OO
the	OO
yáng	OO
of	OO
the	OO

it	OO
creates	OO
60	OO
years	OO
of	OO
different	OO
combinations	,O
known	OO
as	OO
a	OO
sexagenary	OO
cycle	,O
or	OO
gānzhī	.O
so	OU
someone	OO
born	OO
in	OO
1980	OO
would	OO
have	OO
the	OO
sign	OO
of	OO
yáng	OO
metal	OO
monkey	,O
while	OO
someone	OO
born	OO
in	OO
2007	OO
would	OO
be	OO
yīn	OO
fire	OO
pig	.O
in	OU
fact	,O
you	OO
can	OO
also	OO
have	OO
an	OO
inner	OO
animal	OO
based	OO
on	OO
your	OO
birth	OO
month	,O
a	OO
true	OO
animal	OO
based	OO
on	OO
your	OO
birth	OO
date	,O
and	OO
a	OO
secret	OO
animal	OO
based	OO
on	OO
your	OO
birth	OO
hour	.O
it	OU
was	OO
the	OO
great	OO
race	OO
that	OO
supposedly	OO
determined	OO
which	OO
animals	OO
were	OO
enshrined	OO
in	OO
the	OO
chinese	OU
zodiac	,O
but	OO
as	OO
the	OO
system	OO
spread	OO
through	OO
asia	,U
other	OO
cultures	OO
made	OO
changes	OO
to	OO
reflect	OO
their	OO
communities	.O
so	OU
if	OO
you	OO
consult	OO
the	OO
vietnamese	OU
zodiac	,O
you	OO
may	OO
discover	OO
that	OO
you're	OO
a	OO
cat	,O
not	OO
a	OO
rabbit	,O
and	OO
if	OO
you're	OO
in	OO
thailand	,U
a	OO
mythical	OO
snake	OO
called	OO
a	OO
naga	OU
replaces	OO
the	OO

so	OU
whether	OO

you	OO
place	OO
stock	OO
in	OO
what	OO
the	OO

says	OO
about	OO
you	OO

it	OO

it	OO
the	OO

you've	OU
just	OO
saved	OO

of	OO
the	OO

ever	OO
again	.O
now	,U
looking	OO
only	OO
at	OO
the	OO
books	OO
on	OO
the	OO

you	OO
can	OO
again	OO
pick	OO
a	OO
random	OO
partition	OO
book	OO
and	OO
separate	OO
those	OO
books	OO
that	OO
come	OO
before	OO
it	OO
from	OO
those	OO
that	OO

after	OO
it	.O
you	OU
can	OO
keep	OO

sub	OO
partitions	OO
like	OO
this	OO
until	OO
you	OO
have	OO
a	OO
bunch	OO
of	OO
small	OO
sub	OO

each	OO
of	OO
which	OO
you'd	OO
sort	OO
quickly	OO
using	OO
another	OO

insertion	OU
sort	.U
each	OU
round	OO
of	OO

about	OO
1,280	OO

if	OU
your	OO

pretty	OO
balanced	,O
dividing	OO
the	OO

into	OO
128	OO
sub	OO

of	OO
ten	OO
would	OO
take	OO
about	OO
seven	OO

or	OO
8,960	OO

these	OO

would	OO

22	OO

all	OU
in	OO
all	,O
this	OO

the	OO

there's	OO

the	OU

you	OO

you	OO

and	OO
tell	OO
the	OO

you	OO

which	OO

how	?O

answer	OU

answer	OU
in:	OO
1	OO
the	OU
key	OO
is	OO
realizing	OO
that	OO
the	OO
number	OO
of	OO
times	OO
a	OO
locker	OO
is	OO
touched	OO
is	OO
the	OO
same	OO
as	OO
the	OO
number	OO
of	OO
factors	OO
in	OO
the	OO
locker	OO
number	.O
for	OU
example	,O
in	OO
locker	OO
#6	,O
person	OU
1	OO
will	OO
open	OO
it	,O
person	OU
2	OO
will	OO
close	OO
it	,O
person	OU
3	OO
will	OO
open	OO
it	,O
and	OO
person	OU
6	OO
will	OO
close	OO
it	.O
the	OU
numbers	OO
1	,O
2	,O
3	,O
and	OO
6	OO
are	OO
the	OO
factors	OO
of	OO
6	.O
so	OU
when	OO
a	OO
locker	OO
has	OO
an	OO
even	OO
number	OO
of	OO
factors	OO
it	OO
will	OO
remain	OO
closed	,O
and	OO
when	OO
it	OO
has	OO
an	OO
odd	OO
number	OO
of	OO
factors	,O
it	OO
will	OO
remain	OO
open	.O
most	OU
of	OO
the	OO
lockers	OO
have	OO
an	OO
even	OO
number	OO
of	OO
factors	,O
which	OO
makes	OO
sense	OO
because	OO
factors	OO
naturally	OO
pair	OO
up	.O
in	OU
fact	,O
the	OO
only	OO
lockers	OO
that	OO
have	OO
an	OO
odd	OO
number	OO
of	OO
factors	OO
are	OO
perfect	OO
squares	OO
because	OO
those	OO
have	OO
one	OO
factor	OO
that	OO
when	OO
multiplied	OO
by	OO
itself	OO
equals	OO
the	OO
number	.O
for	OU
locker	OU
9	,O
1	OO
will	OO
open	OO
it	,O
3	OO
will	OO
close	,O
and	OO
9	OO
will	OO
open	OO
it	.O
3	OO
x	OO
3	OO
=	OO
9	,O
but	OO
the	OO
3	OO
can	OO
only	OO
be	OO
counted	OO
once	.O
therefore	,U
every	OO
locker	OO
that	OO
is	OO
a	OO
perfect	OO
square	OO
will	OO
remain	OO
open	.O
you	OU
know	OO
that	OO
these	OO
ten	OO
lockers	OO
are	OO
the	OO
solution	,O
so	OO
you	OO
open	OO
them	OO
immediately	OO
and	OO
read	OO
the	OO
words	OO
inside:	OO
the	OU
code	OO
is	OO
the	OO
first	OO
five	OO
lockers	OO
touched	OO
only	OO
twice	.O
you	OU
realize	OO
that	OO
the	OO
only	OO
lockers	OO
touched	OO
twice	OO
have	OO
to	OO
be	OO
prime	OO
numbers	OO
since	OO
each	OO
only	OO
has	OO
two	OO
factors:	OO
1	OO
and	OO
itself	.O
so	OU
the	OO

is	OO

the	OU

there	OO
is	OO
something	OO
about	OO

that	OO
i	OU
find	OO
really	OO
a	OO
little	OO

disturbing	,O
and	OO
i	OU
don't	OO
know	OO
whether	OO
that	OO
is	OO
just	OO
because	OO
i	OU

an	OO

whether	OO
it's	OO
because	OO

question	OO
everything	.O

it	OO
strikes	OO
me	OO
that	OO
a	OO

of	OO

what	OO

it	OO

to	OO

we	OO

the	OO
real	OO

the	OO

for	OO
it	.O
one	OU
of	OO
these	OO

quite	OO
recently	,O
in	OO
the	OO
summer	OO

when	OO
we	OO
opened	OO
up	OO
a	OO
brand	OO
new	OO
war	OO
memorial	OO
right	OO
in	OO
the	OO
middle	OO
of	OO
central	OO
london	.U
it	OU

a	OO
memorial	OO
to	OO
the	OO

the	OO
men	OO

flew	OO
the	OO

so	OO
on	.O
this	OU
is	OO
what	OO
it	OO
looks	OO
like	.O
as	OU
you	OO
can	OO
see	,O
it's	OO
not	OO
exactly	OO
a	OO
shy	OO
and	OO
retiring	OO
piece	OO
of	OO
architecture	,O
it's	OO
actually	OO
quite	OO
huge	.O
it's	OU
by	OO
far	OO
the	OO
largest	OO
war	OO
memorial	OO
that	OO
we	OO
have	OO
in	OO
london	,U
and	OO
i	OU
can	OO
tell	OO
you	OO
there	OO
are	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
war	OO
memorials	OO
in	OO
london	.U
as	OU
you	OO
walk	OO
into	OO
this	OO
thing	,O
there	OO
is	OO
an	OO
inscription	OO
which	OO
tells	OO
you	OO
that	OO
it's	OO
dedicated	OO
to	OO
the	OO
55,000	OO
men	OO
of	OO
bomber	OU

who	OO
lost	OO
their	OO
lives	OO
during	OO

ii	.U
now	,U
when	OO
this	OO
first	OO
opened	,O
in	OO
the	OO
summer	OO
of	OO
2012	,O
i	OU
went	OO
along	OO
to	OO
have	OO
a	OO
look	,O
see	OO
what	OO
i	OU
thought	OO
of	OO
it	,O
have	OO
a	OO
walk	OO
around	.O
there	OU
is	OO
something	OO
really	OO
quite	OO
moving	OO
about	OO
it	OO
actually	.O
you	OU
step	OO
in	OO
through	OO
these	OO
great	OO
big	OO
pillars	,O
and	,O
up	OO
on	OO
the	OO
wall	,O
you	OO
can	OO
see	OO
carved	OO
into	OO
the	OO
stone	,O
there	OO
is	OO
a	OO
quotation	OO
from	OO
winston	OU
churchill	OU
saying	OO
exactly	OO
how	OO
much	OO
we	OO
owe	OO
to	OO
these	OO
men	OO
who	OO
lost	OO
their	OO
lives	.O
parts	OU
of	OO
the	OO
memorial	OO
are	OO
built	OO
out	OO
of	OO
an	OO
actual	OO
world	OU
war	OU
ii	OU
aircraft	OO
that	OO
was	OO
shot	OO
down	OO
during	OO
the	OO
war	.O
so	OU
they	OO
put	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
thought	OO
into	OO
this	.O
it's	OU
actually	OO
really	OO
quite	OO
inspiring	.O
so	OU
as	OO
i	OU
was	OO
walking	OO
around	OO
this	OO
monument	,O
i	OU
couldn't	OO
help	OO
but	OO
feel	OO
this	OO
real	OO
surge	OO
of	OO
pride	.O
i	OU
felt	OO
proud	OO
of	OO
these	OO
men	OO
who	OO
had	OO
given	OO
their	OO
lives	OO
for	OO
something	OO
that	OO
i	OU
hold	OO
dear	.O
i	OU
felt	OO
proud	OO
of	OO
my	OO
country	,O
i	OU
felt	OO
proud	OO
of	OO
the	OO
british	OU
way	OO
of	OO
life	OO
which	OO
had	OO
produced	OO
heroes	OO
like	OO
this	.O
and	OU
yet	,O
there	OO
was	OO
this	OO
little	OO
voice	OO
in	OO
the	OO
back	OO
of	OO
my	OO
head	OO
which	OO
just	OO
wouldn't	OO
go	OO
away	OO
because	OO
i	OU
know	OO
that	OO
55,000	OO
men	OO
of	OO
bomber	OU
command	OU
died	OO
during	OO
world	OU
war	OU
ii	,U
but	OO
i	OU
also	OO
know	OO
that	OO
500,000	OO
germans	OU
died	OO
beneath	OO
the	OO
bombs	OO
that	OO
these	OO
men	OO
dropped	.O
a	OU
lot	OO
of	OO
those	OO
germans	OU
were	OO
nazis	,U
and	OO
i	OU
dare	OO
say	OO
that	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
them	OO
probably	OO
deserved	OO
it	.O
but	OU
the	OO
vast	OO
majority	OO
of	OO
these	OO
people	OO
were	OO
just	OO
ordinary	OO
men	,O
women	OO
and	OO
children	,O
just	OO
like	OO
you	OO
and	OO
me	.O
are	OU
any	OO
of	OO
these	OO
people	OO
at	OO
all	OO
mentioned	OO
on	OO
this	OO
memorial	?O
of	OU
course	OO
they	OO
are	OO
not	.O
if	OU
you	OO
would	OO
suggest	OO
such	OO
a	OO
thing	OO
in	OO
the	OO
summer	OO
of	OO
2012	,O
you	OO
probably	OO
would	OO
have	OO
been	OO
lynched	.O
the	OU
germans	OU
were	OO
our	OO
enemies	OO
during	OO
the	OO
second	OU
world	OU
war	.U
you	OU
can't	OO
mention	OO
the	OO
germans	OU
on	OO
a	OO
british	OU
national	OO
monument	.O
and	OU
yet	OO
not	OO
to	OO
mention	OO
them	,O
to	OO
pretend	OO
that	OO
somehow	OO
this	OO
didn't	OO
happen	,O
or	OO
even	OO
worse	,O
that	OO
somehow	OO
it	OO
doesn't	OO
matter	,O
that	OO
too	OO
makes	OO
me	OO
feel	OO
a	OO
little	OO
bit	OO
uncomfortable	.O
okay	,U
the	OO
germans	OU
are	OO
a	OO
difficult	OO
problem	,O
so	OO
let's	OO
just	OO
put	OO
them	OO
to	OO
one	OO
side	OO
for	OO
a	OO
minute	,O
and	OO
let's	OO
think	OO
instead	OO
about	OO
the	OO
other	OO
nationalities	.O
and	OU
here	OO
is	OO
where	OO
the	OO
story	OO
starts	OO
getting	OO
interesting	.O
because	OU
if	OO
there	OO
is	OO
one	OO
thing	OO
that	OO
we	OO
brits	OU
always	OO
forget	OO
about	OO
the	OO
bomber	OO
war	,O
it's	OO
the	OO
fact	OO
that	OO
we	OO
didn't	OO
only	OO
bomb	OO
germany	.U
more	OU
than	OO
a	OO
third	OO
of	OO
british	OU
and	OO
american	OU
bombs	OO
dropped	OO
on	OO
europe	OU
during	OO
the	OO
war	OO
were	OO
dropped	OO
not	OO
on	OO
germany	OU
but	OO
on	OO
those	OO
countries	OO
we	OO
were	OO
supposed	OO
to	OO
be	OO
liberating	.O
as	OU
a	OO
consequence	,O
50,000	OO
french	OU
civilians	OO
were	OO

by	OO
our	OO

10,000	OO

on	OO
this	OO

they're	OO

and	OU
it	OO
was	OO
while	OO
i	OU
was	OO
thinking	OO
about	OO
that	OO
particular	OO

that	OO
it	OO
finally	OO
dawned	OO
on	OO
me	OO
actually	OO
something	OO
i	OU
probably	OO
should	OO
have	OO
realized	OO
right	OO
from	OO
the	OO
start	OO
which	OO
is	OO
that	OO
memorials	OO
like	OO
this	OO
aren't	OO
designed	OO
to	OO

the	OO
whole	OO
story;	OO
they	OO
are	OO
only	OO
designed	OO
to	OO
tell	OO
those	OO
parts	OO
of	OO
the	OO
story	OO
that	OO
make	OO
british	OU
people	OO
feel	OO
good	OO
about	OO
themselves	.O
that's	OU
all	OO
very	OO
well	OO

good	,O
but	OO
it	OO
does	OO
come	OO
at	OO
a	OO
cost	.O
and	OU
i	OU
couldn't	OO
help	OO
thinking	OO
when	OO
i	OU
was	OO
walking	OO
around	OO
this	OO
thing:	OO
this	OU
was	OO
the	OO
summer	OO
of	OO

this	OO

the	OO
summer	OO
when	OO
the	OO

was	OO
coming	OO
to	OO
london	.U

at	OO
exactly	OO
the	OO
moment	OO
when	OO
the	OO

was	OO
arriving	OO
in	OO
our	OO
city	,O
the	OO

that	OO
we	OO

that	OO
we	OO
will	OO
remember	OO
our	OO
wartime	OO
dead	,O

we	OO
won't	OO
remember	OO
yours	.O
it's	OU

the	OO
exact	OO
opposite	OO
of	OO
the	OO
olympic	OU
spirit	.O
it's	OU
not	OO
only	OO
the	OO
british	OU
who	OO
do	OO
this	,O
of	OO

it's	OO
not	.O
every	OU

does	OO
it	,O
the	OO
americans	,U
for	OO

the	OU
americans	OU

the	OO

that	OO

about	OO
the	OO
french	OU
or	OO
the	OO
koreans	OU
or	OO
the	OO

the	OO

we	OU
all	OO

this	.O
we	OU

we	OU

that	OO

what	OO
we	OO
don't	OO

to	OO
remember	OO
is	OO
those	OO

areas	.O
and	OU
it's	OO
that	OO
which	OO
i	OU
find	OO
most	OO
uncomfortable	OO
about	OO
this	,O
because	,O
as	OO
far	OO
as	OO
i	OU
am	OO
concerned	,O
it's	OO
the	OO
grey	OO
areas	OO
that	OO
make	OO
history	OO
interesting	.O
in	OU
a	OO
sense	,O
all	OO
good	OO
history	OO
is	OO
about	OO
the	OO
grey	OO
areas	.O
but	OU
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
people	OO
don't	OO
seem	OO
to	OO
have	OO
time	OO
for	OO
complicated	OO
stories	.O
they	OU
don't	OO
have	OO
time	OO
for	OO
difficult	OO
and	OO
uncomfortable	OO
emotions	.O
in	OU
fact	,O
i'm	OU
quickly	OO
coming	OO
to	OO
the	OO
conclusion	OO
that	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
people	OO
don't	OO
really	OO
have	OO
time	OO
for	OO
history	OO
at	OO
all	.O
what	OU
they	OO
really	OO
want	OO
is	OO
a	OO
myth	.O
now	,U
you	OO
might	OO
ask	OO
yourselves:	OO
what	OU
does	OO
any	OO
of	OO
this	OO
matter	?O
i	OU
mean	,O
we	OO
all	OO
like	OO
a	OO
good	OO
story	,O
don't	OO
we	?O
if	OU
that	OO
story	OO
makes	OO
us	OO
feel	OO
good	OO
about	OO
ourselves	,O
then	OO
so	OO
much	OO
the	OO
better	.O
it's	OU
all	OO
in	OO
the	OO
past	OO
anyway	,O
so	OO
what	OO
does	OO
it	OO
matter	?O
but	OU
that's	OO
just	OO
the	OO
problem	,O
isn't	OO
it	?O
because	OU
it's	OO
not	OO
all	OO
in	OO
the	OO
past	.O
and	OU
there	OO
is	OO
a	OO
dark	OO
side	OO
to	OO
all	OO
of	OO
these	OO
stories	OO
and	OO
myths	OO
that	OO
can	OO
be	OO
really	OO
damaging	.O
when	OU
the	OO
former	OO
yugoslavia	OU
tore	OO
itself	OO
apart	OO
in	OO
the	OO

the	OO

thing	OO
that	OO

that	OO

the	OO

what	OO

this	OO

at	OO
all	.O
they	OU
are	OO
about	OO
a	OO

a	OO
modern	OO
situation	.O
the	OU
only	OO
reason	OO
to	OO

is	OO
to	OO
provoke	OO
an	OO

if	OU

one	OO

that	OO
i	OU
want	OO
you	OO
to	OO
take	OO
away	OO
with	OO
you	OO
today	,O
it	OO
is	OO
this:	OO
whenever	OU
you	OO

a	OO

a	OO
diplomat	,O
mention	OO
the	OO

i	OU
want	OO

because	OU
when	OO

this	OU

you	OO

an	OO

that	OO
has	OO
never	OO
before	OO
existed	OO
in	OO
all	OO
of	OO

how	OU
can	OO
this	OO
be	?O
the	OU
answer	OO
lies	OO
in	OO
how	OO
many	OO

arrangements	OO
of	OO
52	OO

or	OO
any	OO

are	OO
possible	.O
now	,U
52	OO
may	OO
not	OO
seem	OO
like	OO
such	OO
a	OO
high	OO
number	,O
but	OO
let's	OO
start	OO
with	OO
an	OO
even	OO
smaller	OO
one	.O
say	OU
we	OO
have	OO
four	OO
people	OO
trying	OO
to	OO
sit	OO
in	OO
four	OO
numbered	OO
chairs	.O
how	OU
many	OO
ways	OO
can	OO
they	OO
be	OO
seated	?O
to	OU
start	OO
off	,O
any	OO
of	OO
the	OO
four	OO
people	OO
can	OO
sit	OO
in	OO
the	OO
first	OO
chair	.O
one	OU
this	OO
choice	OO
is	OO
made	,O
only	OO
three	OO
people	OO
remain	OO
standing	.O
after	OU
the	OO
second	OO
person	OO
sits	OO
down	,O
only	OO
two	OO
people	OO
are	OO
left	OO
as	OO
candidates	OO
for	OO
the	OO
third	OO
chair	.O
and	OU
after	OO
the	OO
third	OO
person	OO
has	OO
sat	OO
down	,O
the	OO
last	OO
person	OO
standing	OO
has	OO
no	OO
choice	OO
but	OO
to	OO
sit	OO
in	OO
the	OO
fourth	OO
chair	.O
if	OU
we	OO
manually	OO
write	OO
out	OO
all	OO
the	OO
possible	OO
arrangements	,O
or	OO
permutations	,O
it	OO
turns	OO
out	OO
that	OO
there	OO
are	OO
24	OO
ways	OO
that	OO
four	OO
people	OO
can	OO
be	OO
seated	OO
into	OO
four	OO
chairs	,O
but	OO
when	OO
dealing	OO
with	OO
larger	OO
numbers	,O
this	OO
can	OO
take	OO
quite	OO
a	OO
while	.O
so	OU
let's	OO
see	OO
if	OO
there's	OO
a	OO
quicker	OO
way	.O
going	OU
from	OO
the	OO
beginning	OO
again	,O
you	OO
can	OO
see	OO
that	OO
each	OO
of	OO
the	OO
four	OO
initial	OO
choices	OO
for	OO
the	OO
first	OO
chair	OO
leads	OO
to	OO
three	OO
more	OO
possible	OO
choices	OO
for	OO
the	OO
second	OO
chair	,O
and	OO
each	OO
of	OO
those	OO
choices	OO
leads	OO
to	OO
two	OO
more	OO
for	OO
the	OO
third	OO
chair	.O
so	OU
instead	OO
of	OO
counting	OO
each	OO
final	OO
scenario	OO
individually	,O
we	OO
can	OO
multiply	OO
the	OO
number	OO
of	OO
choices	OO
for	OO
each	OO
chair:	OO
four	OO
times	OO
three	OO
times	OO
two	OO
times	OO
one	OO
to	OO
achieve	OO
the	OO
same	OO
result	OO
of	OO
24	.O
an	OU
interesting	OO
pattern	OO
emerges	.O
we	OU
start	OO
with	OO
the	OO
number	OO
of	OO
objects	OO
we're	OO
arranging	,O
four	OO
in	OO
this	OO
case	,O
and	OO
multiply	OO
it	OO
by	OO
consecutively	OO
smaller	OO
integers	OO
until	OO
we	OO
reach	OO
one	.O
this	OU
is	OO
an	OO
exciting	OO
discovery	.O
so	OU
exciting	OO
that	OO
mathematicians	OO
have	OO
chosen	OO
to	OO
symbolize	OO
this	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
calculation	,O
known	OO
as	OO
a	OO
factorial	,O
with	OO
an	OO
exclamation	OO
mark	.O
as	OU
a	OO
general	OO
rule	,O
the	OO
factorial	OO
of	OO
any	OO
positive	OO
integer	OO
is	OO
calculated	OO
as	OO
the	OO
product	OO
of	OO
that	OO
same	OO
integer	OO
and	OO
all	OO
smaller	OO
integers	OO
down	OO
to	OO
one	.O
in	OU
our	OO
simple	OO
example	,O
the	OO
number	OO
of	OO
ways	OO
four	OO
people	OO
can	OO
be	OO
arranged	OO
into	OO
chairs	OO
is	OO
written	OO
as	OO
four	OO
factorial	,O
which	OO
equals	OO
24	.O
so	OU
let's	OO
go	OO
back	OO
to	OO
our	OO
deck	.O
just	OU
as	OO
there	OO
were	OO
four	OO
factorial	OO
ways	OO
of	OO
arranging	OO
four	OO
people	,O
there	OO
are	OO
52	OO
factorial	OO
ways	OO
of	OO
arranging	OO
52	OO
cards	.O
fortunately	,U
we	OO
don't	OO
have	OO
to	OO
calculate	OO
this	OO
by	OO
hand	.O
just	OU
enter	OO
the	OO
function	OO
into	OO
a	OO
calculator	,O
and	OO
it	OO
will	OO
show	OO
you	OO
that	OO
the	OO
number	OO
of	OO
possible	OO
arrangements	OO
is	OO
8.07	OO
x	OO
10^67	,O
or	OO
roughly	OO
eight	OO
followed	OO
by	OO
67	OO
zeros	.O
just	OU
how	OO
big	OO
is	OO
this	OO
number	?O
well	,U
if	OO
a	OO
new	OO
permutation	OO
of	OO
52	OO
cards	OO
were	OO
written	OO
out	OO
every	OO
second	OO
starting	OO
13.8	OO
billion	OO
years	OO
ago	,O
when	OO
the	OO
big	OU

is	OO
thought	OO
to	OO
have	OO
occurred	,O
the	OO

still	OO
be	OO
continuing	OO
today	OO
and	OO
for	OO
millions	OO
of	OO
years	OO
to	OO
come	.O
in	OU
fact	,O
there	OO
are	OO
more	OO
possible	OO
ways	OO
to	OO
arrange	OO
this	OO
simple	OO
deck	OO
of	OO
cards	OO
than	OO
there	OO

so	OU
the	OO
next	OO
time	OO
it's	OO
your	OO
turn	OO
to	OO

take	OO
a	OO
moment	OO
to	OO

that	OO

never	OO
before	OO

again	.O
we	OU
usually	OO
think	OO
of	OO
rhythm	OO
as	OO
an	OO
element	OO
of	OO
music	,O
but	OO
it's	OO
actually	OO
found	OO
everywhere	OO
in	OO
the	OO
world	OO
around	OO
us	,O
from	OO
the	OO
ocean	OO
tides	OO
to	OO
our	OO
own	OO
heartbeats	,O
rhythm	OO
is	OO
essentially	OO
an	OO
event	OO
repeating	OO
regularly	OO
over	OO
time	.O
even	OU
the	OO
ticking	OO
of	OO
a	OO
clock	OO
itself	OO
is	OO
a	OO
sort	OO
of	OO
rhythm	.O
but	OU
for	OO
musical	OO
rhythm	,O
a	OO
steady	OO
string	OO
of	OO
repeating	OO
single	OO
beats	OO
is	OO
not	OO
enough	.O
for	OU
that	,O
we	OO
need	OO
at	OO
least	OO
one	OO
opposing	OO
beat	OO
with	OO
a	OO
different	OO
sound	,O
which	OO
can	OO
be	OO
the	OO
unstressed	OO

the	OO

there	OU
are	OO
several	OO

whether	OO

the	OU

a	OO

there's	OU
just	OO

problem;	OO
the	OO

the	OO

them	OO
to	OO
their	OO
doom	OO
through	OO

remembering	OU
the	OO
green	OO

you	OO
realize	OO
two	OO
of	OO
the	OO
students	OO
have	OO
been	OO
cursed	.O
at	OU
any	OO
time	,O
one	OO
or	OO
both	OO
of	OO
them	OO

they	OO

you	OU

for	OO
sure	OO
that	OO
the	OO

you	,O
but	OO
you	OO
don't	OO
know	OO
which	OO
students	OO
can't	OO
be	OO

because	OO
the	OO

the	OU
first	OO
thing	OO
to	OO

that	OO
since	OO
you	OO

you	OO
aren't	OO
possessed	,O
you	OO
can	OO
explore	OO
one	OO
of	OO
the	OO

this	OU

eight	OO
students	OO
for	OO
the	OO
remaining	OO
three	OO
paths	.O
sending	OU
groups	OO
of	OO
four	OO
down	OO
just	OO
two	OO
of	OO
the	OO
paths	OO
won't	OO
work	OO
because	OO
if	OO

two	OO
versus	OO
two	,O
you'd	OO
have	OO
to	OO
guess	OO
who	OO
to	OO
trust	.O
but	OU
splitting	OO
them	OO
into	OO
one	OO
pair	OO
and	OO
two	OO
trios	OO
would	OO
work	OO
every	OO
time	,O
and	OO
here's	OO
why	.O
the	OU
possessed	OO
students	OO
might	OO
lie	,O
or	OO
they	OO
might	OO
not	,O
but	OO
you	OO
know	OO
there	OO
are	OO
only	OO
two	OO
of	OO
them	,O
while	OO
the	OO
other	OO
six	OO
will	OO
always	OO

the	OO

when	OU
each	OO

returns	OO
to	OO
the	OO
hall	,O
all	OO
of	OO
its	OO
members	OO
will	OO
either	OO
give	OO
the	OO

report	OO
or	OO
argue	OO
about	OO
whether	OO
they	OO
found	OO
the	OO
exit	.O
if	OU
a	OO
trio	OO
returns	OO
in	OO
total	OO
agreement	,O
then	OO
you	OO
know	OO
none	OO
of	OO
them	OO
are	OO
lying	.O
with	OU
the	OO
pair	,O
you	OO
can't	OO
be	OO
sure	OO
either	OO
way	,O
but	OO
all	OO
you	OO
need	OO
is	OO
reliable	OO
evidence	OO
about	OO
three	OO
of	OO
the	OO
four	OO
paths	.O
the	OU
fourth	OO
you	OO
can	OO
figure	OO
out	OO
using	OO
the	OO
process	OO
of	OO
elimination	.O
of	OU
course	,O
none	OO
of	OO
this	OO
matters	OO
if	OO
you're	OO
lucky	OO
enough	OO
to	OO
find	OO
the	OO
exit	OO
yourself	,O
but	OO
otherwise	,O
putting	OO
everything	OO
together	OO
leaves	OO
you	OO
with	OO
three	OO
possibilities	.O
if	OU
each	OO

gives	OO
a	OO
consistent	OO
answer	,O
either	OO

only	OO
one	OO

you	OO

safely	OO
trust	OO
the	OO

in	OO
both	OO

since	OO
at	OO

two	OO
people	OO

will	OO

the	OU

you	OO

of	OO

you're	OU
all	OO
safe	OO

from	OO
the	OO

after	OU
that	OO
ordeal	,O
you	OO
tell	OO
your	OO

they	OO
all	OO
deserve	OO
a	OO
vacation	,O
and	OO
you	OO
just	OO
happen	OO
to	OO

another	OO
expedition	OO
coming	OO
up	.O
well	,U
i	OU
don't	OO
know	OO
about	OO
you	OO
guys	,O
but	OO
for	OO
me	,O
the	OO
part	OO
that	OO
i	OU
enjoyed	OO
the	OO
most	OO
about	OO
going	OO
to	OO
school	OO
is	OO
when	OO
they	OO
took	OO
us	OO
out	OO
on	OO
excursions	OO
or	OO
we	OO
went	OO
camping	.O
i	OU
think	OO
i	OU
liked	OO
it	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
because	OO
in	OO
that	OO
moment	OO
you	OO
felt	OO
free	,O
you	OO
could	OO
see	OO
your	OO
friends	OO
with	OO
the	OO
light	OO
of	OO
day	,O
you	OO
could	OO
watch	OO
the	OO
teacher	OO
interact	OO
with	OO
the	OO
real	OO
world	.O
but	OU
i	OU
think	OO
that	OO
the	OO
most	OO
important	OO
was	OO
that	OO
when	OO
we	OO
went	OO
on	OO
excursion	OO
learning	OO
and	OO
living	OO
were	OO
part	OO
of	OO
the	OO
same	OO
thing	.O
i	OU
work	OO
as	OO
a	OO
director	OO
and	OO
screenwriter	OO
and	OO
in	OO
2009	OO
we	OO
had	OO
a	OO
problem	.O
we	OU
had	OO
to	OO
ideate	OO
a	OO
tv	OU
show	OO
for	OO
kids	OO
that	OO
would	OO
tell	OO
the	OO
children	OO
about	OO
the	OO
may	OU
revolution	OU
and	OO
the	OO
problem	OO
was	OO
that	OO
nothing	OO
came	OO
to	OO
us	.O
to	OU
make	OO
things	OO
worse	,O
with	OO
sebastian	OU
mignona	OU
and	OO
nicolas	OU
dardano	,U
we	OO
have	OO
had	OO
the	OO
wonderful	OO
idea	OO
of	OO
offering	OO
to	OO
the	OO
ministry	OU
of	OO
education's	OU
tv	OU
channel	OO
to	OO
make	OO
an	OO
animated	OO
program;	OO
when	OO
none	OO
of	OO
us	OO
had	OO
the	OO
slightest	OO
idea	OO
on	OO
how	OO
to	OO
create	OO
a	OO
cartoon	OO
film	.O
if	OU
you	OO
asked	OO
me	OO
when	OO
i	OU
was	OO
a	OO
boy	OO
what	OO
i	OU
wanted	OO
to	OO
do	OO
when	OO
i	OU
grew	OO
older	,O
i	OU
would	OO
answer:	OO
i	OU
want	OO
to	OO
work	OO
making	OO
cartoons	.O
but	OU
it	OO
seems	OO
that	OO
with	OO
time	OO
i	OU
began	OO
noticing	OO
that	OO
animations	OO
were	OO
done	OO
in	OO
the	OO
united	OU
states	.U
so	OU
if	OO
i	OU
wanted	OO
that	OO
work	,O
i	OU
would	OO
have	OO
to	OO
be	OO
far	OO
from	OO
my	OO
parents	,O
and	OO
i	OU
likely	OO
gave	OO
up	.O
but	OU
now	,O
i	OU
had	OO
the	OO
chance	OO
to	OO
write	OO
and	OO
direct	OO
a	OO
cartoon	.O
so	,U
a	OO
bit	OO
to	OO
reconnect	OO
myself	OO
with	OO
what	OO
i	OU
liked	OO
so	OO
much	OO
from	OO
the	OO
school	,O
and	OO
also	,O
i	OU
think	,O
to	OO
see	OO
if	OO
an	OO
idea	OO
would	OO
occur	OO
to	OO
me	,O
i	OU
went	OO
alone	OO
on	OO
an	OO
excursion	OO
to	OO
the	OO
buenos	OU

cabildo	.U
i	OU
arrive	OO
at	OO
the	OO

i	OU
go	OO
up	OO
to	OO
the	OO

and	OO
i	OU
find	OO
this	OO

the	OU

and	OO
so	OO
i	OU
get	OO
closer	,O
read	OO
the	OO

i	OU
look	OO
at	OO

there	OO
i	OU
had	OO
the	OO

this	OU
is	OO
a	OO

there's	OU
no	OO

—	OO
there's	OU
no	OO

you	OO

you	OO

five	OO

they	OO

what	OO
is	OO
the	OO

could	OU
we	OO

it	OU

that	OO

you	OO
lift	OO
a	OO

when	OO
they	OO
want	OO
to	OO
sell	OO
you	OO
something	OO
you	OO
do	OO

there	,U
i	OU
noticed	OO
that	OO
i	OU
passed	OO
through	OO

without	OO
understanding	OO

why	OO
san	OU

they	OO
must	OO
have	OO

it	OO
to	OO

every	OO
august	OU
17th	.O
but	OU
it	OO
didn't	OO
hit	OO
me	,O
i	OU
didn't	OO
get	OO
it	,O
or	OO
it	OO
did	OO
not	OO
stick	.O
when	OU
i	OU
returned	OO
from	OO
the	OO
cabildo	,U
i	OU
started	OO
thinking:	OO
so	,U
what	OO
stuck	OO
with	OO
me	OO
from	OO
school	?O
and	OU
then	OO
comes	OO
the	OO
image	OO
of	OO
my	OO

you	OU
may	OO
as	OO

a	OO

from	OO

well	,U
claudio	OU
simari	OU
was	OO
mine	.O
he	OU
was	OO
my	OO
teacher	OO
from	OO
4th	OO
grade	.O
and	OU
i	OU
was	OO
reminded	OO
of	OO
him	OO
because	OO
he	OO
was	OO
able	OO
to	OO
overcome	OO
the	OO
barrier	OO
that	OO
i	OU
had	OO
placed	.O
and	OU
i	OU
remembered	OO
two	OO
moments	OO
where	OO
claudio	OU
did	OO
it	.O
and	OU
maybe	OO
in	OO
that	OO
there	OO
was	OO
an	OO
idea	OO
to	OO
create	OO
this	OO
cartoon	.O
one	OU
morning	OO
claudio	OU
arrived	OO
and	OO
he	OO
put	OO
on	OO
a	OO
piece	OO
of	OO
music	.O
claudio	OU
chose	OO
a	OO
song	OO
by	OO
terea	OU
parodi	OU
that	OO
was	OO
called	OO
hurry	OU
up	OO
jose	,U
and	OO
he	OO
wanted	OO
to	OO
explain	OO
to	OO
us	OO
the	OO
drama	OO
of	OO
the	OO
floods	OO
in	OO
formosa	.U
for	OU
those	OO
who	OO
don't	OO

it	,O
the	OO

a	OO

call	OO
from	OO
a	OO
woman	OO
to	OO
her	OO
husband	OO
to	OO
escape	OO
together	OO
before	OO
the	OO
flood	OO

that	OU
was	OO
enough	OO
for	OO

to	OO
never	OO

about	OO
the	OO

of	OO

for	OO

listen	OO

up	OO
jose	,U
to	OO
be	OO

again	.O
the	OU

thing	OO
i	OU
remember	OO
about	OO
claudio	OU
is	OO
that	OO
one	OO
day	OO
he	OO
decided	OO
to	OO
share	OO
with	OO
us	OO
a	OO
personal	OO
story	.O
and	OU
he	OO

it	OO
in	OO
such	OO
a	OO

that	OO
i	OU
can	OO
even	OO

where	OO
i	OU
was	OO
sitting	OO
in	OO
the	OO

it	OU
turned	OO

that	OO
claudio	OU

claudio	OU
was	OO
in	OO
the	OO

the	OO

that	OO
was	OO
going	OO
to	OO
take	OO
him	OO
to	OO
the	OO

he	OU
already	OO

he	OO

that	OO

how	OU

do	OO
it	?O
how	OU
did	OO
he	OO
impart	OO
on	OO
us	OO
ideas	OO
that	OO
30	OO
years	OO
later	OO
i	OU
still	OO
keep	OO
remembering	?O
i	OU
realized	OO
one	OO
thing	.O
what	OU
claudio	OU
did	,O
first	OO
of	OO
all	,O
was	OO
to	OO
tell	OO
us	OO
stories	.O
and	OU
we	OO
lived	OO
them	OO
like	OO
we	OO
were	OO
there	OO
with	OO
him	.O
claudio	OU
was	OO
a	OO
sort	OO
of	OO
medium	,O
and	OO
we	OO
lived	OO
that	OO
experience	OO
we	OO
were	OO
in	OO
the	OO
classroom	OO
but	OO
we	OO
felt	OO
on	OO
an	OO
adventure	.O
and	OU
the	OO
other	OO
thing	OO
i	OU
realized	OO
of	OO
claudio	OU
is	OO
that	OO
he	OO
never	OO
underestimated	OO
us	.O
we	OU
always	OO
thanked	OO
him	OO
for	OO
that	,O
because	OO
claudio	OU
didn't	OO
treat	OO
us	OO
like	OO
infants	.O
we	OU
preferred	OO
claudio	OU
over	OO
those	OO
men	OO
and	OO
women	OO
in	OO
television	OO
who	OO
would	OO
disguise	OO
as	OO
boys	OO
or	OO
girls	.O
at	OU
first	,O
they'd	OO
come	OO
closer	OO
to	OO
become	OO
your	OO
friends	,O
and	OO
then	OO
you	OO
realize	OO
that	OO
they	OO
want	OO
to	OO
teach	OO
you	OO
numbers	OO
or	OO
colors	,O
or	OO
sell	OO
you	OO
something	.O
seems	OU
like	OO
claudio	OU
knew	OO
that	OO
if	OO
you	OO
treat	OO
a	OO
child	OO
like	OO
a	OO
fool	,O
you	OO
ran	OO
the	OO
risk	OO
that	,O
whether	OO
the	OO
child	OO
thinks	OO
that	OO
you	OO
are	OO
the	OO
fool	,O
because	OO
you're	OO
speaking	OO
to	OO
them	OO
like	OO
that	,O
or	OO
that	OO
they	OO
grow	OO
up	OO
thinking	OO
they	OO
are	OO
a	OO
fool	,O
which	OO
is	OO
much	OO
worse	.O
children	OU
can	OO
be	OO
lovely	,O
tender	,O
sensitive	,O
but	OO
the	OO
truth	OO
is	OO
they	OO
are	OO
the	OO
same	OO
who	OO
invented	OO
bullying	.O
they	OU
can	OO
be	OO
tyrants	,O
cruel	,O
fickle	OO
beings	,O
just	OO
like	OO
us	.O
if	OU
they	OO
are	OO
like	OO
us	,O
then	OO
why	OO
should	OO
we	OO
treat	OO
them	OO
in	OO
a	OO
different	OO
way	?O
now	,U
how	OO
are	OO
we	?O
that	OU
was	OO
the	OO
question	OO
that	OO
we	OO
asked	OO
ourselves	OO
in	OO
that	OO
moment	.O
one	OU
of	OO
my	OO
first	OO
assignments	OO
as	OO
director	OO
of	OO
the	OU
dog	OU
on	OO
the	OO
moon	OU
—	OO
way	OO
before	OO
creating	OO
zamba	OU
—	OO
was	OO
traveling	OO
across	OO
the	OO
country	OO
visiting	OO
public	OO
schools	OO
and	OO
interviewing	OO
kids	.O
i	OU
must	OO
have	OO
interviewed	OO
around	OO
1,500	OO
or	OO
2,000	OO
kids	.O
they	OU
taught	OO
me	OO
to	OO
stop	OO
looking	OO
at	OO
them	OO
from	OO
above	,O
to	OO
lower	OO
the	OO
camera	,O
to	OO
look	OO
at	OO
them	OO
in	OO
the	OO
eyes	,O
and	OO
to	OO
see	OO
the	OO
world	OO
as	OO
they	OO
see	OO
it	.O
that	OU
ended	OO
up	OO
having	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
impact	OO
in	OO
the	OO
project	,O
because	OO
there	OO
is	OO
something	OO
from	OO
each	OO
of	OO
those	OO
kids	OO
in	OO
zamba	.U
anyone	OU
who	OO
had	OO
contact	OO
with	OO
argentina's	OU
hinterland	OO
knows	OO
that	OO
the	OO
representation	OO
of	OO
children	OO
we	OO
see	OO
on	OO
tv	OU
is	OO
quite	OO
different	OO
from	OO
reality	.O
of	OU
course	,O
because	OO
tv	OU
is	OO
designed	OO
to	OO
treat	OO
children	OO
as	OO
consumers	.O
paka	OU
paka	OU
comes	OO
to	OO
treat	OO
children	OO
like	OO
children	,O
and	OO
for	OO
us	OO
as	OO
storytellers	,O
that	OO
was	OO
an	OO
incredible	OO
opportunity	.O
so	OU
we	OO
started	OO
to	OO
design	OO
the	OO
character	.O
we	OU
had	OO
to	OO
think	OO
of	OO
an	OO
argentine	OU
boy	.O
if	OU
you	OO
were	OO
to	OO
draw	OO
an	OO
argentine	OU
boy	,O
what	OO
would	OO
you	OO
do	?O
what	OU
would	OO
the	OO
hair	OO
color	OO
be	?O
his	OU
skin	OO
color	?O
what	OU
would	OO
the	OO
width	OO
of	OO
the	OO
nose	OO
be	?O
these	OU
are	OO
the	OO
first	OO
sketches	OO
of	OO
zamba	.U
at	OU
that	OO
time	OO
we	OO
asked	OO
ourselves	OO
if	OO
boys	OO
and	OO
girls	OO
would	OO
identify	OO
with	OO
a	OO
boy	OO
who	OO
did	OO
not	OO
have	OO
super	OO
powers	,O
and	OO
that	OO
instead	OO
of	OO
a	OO
cape	,O
he	OO
wears	OO
a	OO
pinafore	OO
like	OO
them	.O
finally	,U
this	OO
is	OO
the	OO
definitive	OO
design	OO
of	OO
zamba	.U
we	OU
made	OO
him	OO
short	OO
like	OO
messi	OU
for	OO
agility	OO
and	OO
to	OO
facilitate	OO
escaping	.O
he	OU
has	OO
a	OO
backpack	OO
so	OO
he's	OO
similar	OO
to	OO
those	OO
hectic	OO
kids	OO
that	OO
are	OO
running	OO
around	OO
with	OO
their	OO
backpack	OO
on	.O
we	OU
put	OO
on	OO
his	OO
pajamas	OO
under	OO
his	OO
pinafore	.O
we	OU
made	OO
his	OO
skin	OO
brown	.O
if	OU
you	OO
look	OO
carefully	,O
he	OO
has	OO
like	OO
some	OO
little	OO
horns	OO
here	,O
to	OO
make	OO
it	OO
look	OO
a	OO
bit	OO
more	OO
mischievous	.O
and	OU
we	OO
gave	OO
him	OO
a	OO
broken	OO
tooth	,O
as	OO
a	OO
war	OO
wound	OO
of	OO
that	OO
battle	OO
we	OO
all	OO
go	OO
through	OO
and	OO
is	OO
called	OO
infancy	.O
at	OU
this	OO
point	,O
you	OO
should	OO
be	OO
asking:	OO
how	OU
is	OO
it	OO
that	OO
a	OO
guy	OO
who	OO
went	OO
through	OO
elementary	OO
or	OO
middle	OO
school	OO
without	OO
knowing	OO
why	OO
san	OU
martin	OU
had	OO
crossed	OO
the	OO
andes	,U
can	OO
write	OO
and	OO
direct	OO
a	OO
program	OO
on	OO
history	?O
gabriel	OU
di	OU
meglio	,U
who	OO
is	OO
a	OO
historian	OO
and	OO
researcher	OO
at	OO
the	OO
conicet	,U
was	OO
on	OO
the	OO
team	.O
gaby	,U
among	OO
other	OO
things	,O
chose	OO
to	OO
be	OO
a	OO
historian	OO
because	OO
in	OO
his	OO
childhood	OO
he	OO
read	OO
asterix	.U
and	OU
i	OU
had	OO
the	OO
chance	OO
to	OO
sit	OO
with	OO
him	,O
face	OO
to	OO
face	,O
and	OO
ask	OO
him	OO
about	OO
history	OO
in	OO
the	OO
same	OO
way	OO
zamba	OU
asks	OO
san	OU
martin	.U
then	,U
what	OO
at	OO
first	OO
seemed	OO
a	OO
hindrance	OO
ended	OO
up	OO
being	OO
an	OO
advantage	OO
because	OO
i	OU
could	OO
write	OO
zamba	OU
from	OO
naivety	,O
without	OO
solemnity	.O
we	OU
could	OO
get	OO
our	OO
heroes	OO
off	OO
their	OO
horses	,O
we	OO
could	OO
brush	OO
off	OO
the	OO
bronze;	OO
we	OO
could	OO
tell	OO
our	OO
history	OO
through	OO
humor	.O
today	,U
we	OO
live	OO
in	OO
a	OO
time	OO
of	OO
peace	.O
but	OU
throughout	OO
our	OO
history	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
men	OO
and	OO
women	OO
lost	OO
their	OO
lives	,O
the	OO
only	OO
life	OO
they	OO
had	,O
to	OO
fight	OO
for	OO
values	OO
like	OO
freedom	OO
and	OO
independence	.O
and	OU
they	OO
could	OO
not	OO
see	OO
the	OO
outcome	OO
of	OO
that	OO
struggle	.O
it	OU
hurt	OO
me	,O
for	OO
example	,O
when	OO
i	OU
came	OO
to	OO
know	OO
that	OO
belgrano	OU
died	OO
in	OO
a	OO
period	OO
of	OO
anarchy	,O
with	OO
the	OO
feeling	OO
that	OO
all	OO
he	OO
had	OO
done	OO
had	OO
rendered	OO
useless	.O
but	OU
it	OO
was	OO
useful	.O
to	OU
all	OO
who	OO
do	OO
zamba	,U
we	OO
like	OO
to	OO
think	OO
that	OO
belgrano	,U
san	OU
martin	,U
sarmiento	OU
or	OO
juana	OU
azurduy	OU
would	OO
like	OO
to	OO
know	OO
that	OO
those	OO
values	OO
of	OO

independence	OO
are	OO
moving	OO
on	OO
to	OO
the	OO
next	OO

today	,U
kids	OO
recognize	OO
their	OO

recognize	OO
them	OO
as	OO
characters	OO
of	OO
zamba	OU
on	OO

zamba	OU
might	OO
be	OO
revolutionary	?O
i	OU
have	OO
no	OO
idea	.O
we	OU

this	OO
by	OO
now	.O
we	OU
may	OO
have	OO
to	OO
wait	OO
20	OO
or	OO
30	OO
years	.O
and	OU
something	OO
similar	OO
must	OO
happen	OO
with	OO
teachers	,O
right	?O
how	OU
much	OO
time	OO
must	OO
pass	OO
so	OO
you	OO
can	OO
see	OO
the	OO
result	OO
of	OO
their	OO

and	OU
when	OO
i	OU

this	OO

tin	.O
my	OU

to	OO

your	OO

30	OO
years	OO

perhaps	OO
you	OO
don't	OO
remember	OO
me	.O
i	OU

you	OO

one	OO
of	OO

what	OO

for	OO
the	OO

in	OO

a	OO
key	OO
role	OO
in	OO
identifying	OO
a	OO

as	OO
a	OO

the	OU
idea	OO
is	OO
that	OO
you	OO

even	OO
the	OO

that	OO

furthermore	,U
homo	OU

even	OO
with	OO

has	OO
a	OO

similar	OO
to	OO

that	OO

the	OO
capability	.O
with	OU
two	OO

at	OO

we	OO

we	OO

the	OO

so	OU
where	OO

who	OU

we're	OU
still	OO
trying	OO
to	OO
figure	OO
all	OO
that	OO
out	.O
it's	OU
ironic	,O
because	OO
paleoanthropologists	OO

for	OO

we	OU

if	OU
one	OO

it'll	OO

have	OO
to	OO

are	OO
all	OO
out	.O

two	OO

or	OO
one	OO
of	OO
each	OO

both	OO

in	OO
the	OO

for	OU

now	,U

for	OO
the	OO

we	OO

to	OO

the	OO

and	OO
the	OO

now	OU
we	OO

the	OO

the	OO

that's	OO

where	OO
the	OO
wildebeest	OO
are	OO
waiting	.O
what	OU
now	?O
well	,U
since	OO
we've	OO
got	OO
two	OO
lions	OO
waiting	OO
on	OO
the	OO
left	OO
bank	,O
the	OO
only	OO
option	OO
is	OO
for	OO
two	OO
wildebeest	OO
to	OO
cross	.O
next	,U
there's	OO
no	OO
sense	OO
in	OO
two	OO
wildebeest	OO
going	OO
back	,O
since	OO
that	OO
just	OO
reverses	OO
the	OO
last	OO
step	.O
and	OU
if	OO
two	OO
lions	OO
go	OO
back	,O
they'll	OO
outnumber	OO
the	OO
wildebeest	OO
on	OO
the	OO
right	OO
bank	.O
so	OU
one	OO
lion	OO
and	OO
one	OO
wildebeest	OO
take	OO
the	OO
raft	OO
back	OO
leaving	OO
us	OO
with	OO
one	OO
of	OO
each	OO
animal	OO
on	OO
the	OO
left	OO
bank	OO
and	OO
two	OO
of	OO
each	OO
on	OO
the	OO
right	.O
again	,U
there's	OO
no	OO
point	OO
in	OO
sending	OO
the	OO
lion	OO
wildebeest	OO
pair	OO
back	,O
so	OO
the	OO
next	OO
trip	OO
should	OO
be	OO
either	OO
a	OO
pair	OO
of	OO
lions	OO
or	OO
a	OO
pair	OO
of	OO
wildebeest	.O
if	OU
the	OO
lions	OO
go	,O
they'd	OO
eat	OO
the	OO
wildebeest	OO
on	OO
the	OO
left	,O
so	OO
they	OO
stay	,O
and	OO
the	OO
two	OO
wildebeest	OO
cross	OO
instead	.O
now	OU
we're	OO
quite	OO
close	OO
because	OO
the	OO
wildebeest	OO
are	OO
all	OO
where	OO
they	OO
need	OO
to	OO
be	OO
with	OO
safety	OO
in	OO
numbers	.O
all	OU
that's	OO
left	OO
is	OO
for	OO
that	OO
one	OO
lion	OO
to	OO
raft	OO
back	OO
and	OO
bring	OO
his	OO
fellow	OO
lions	OO
over	OO
one	OO
by	OO
one	.O
that	OU
makes	OO
eleven	OO
trips	OO
total	,O
the	OO
smallest	OO
number	OO
needed	OO
to	OO
get	OO
everyone	OO
across	OO
safely	.O
the	OU
solution	OO
that	OO
involves	OO
sending	OO
both	OO
lions	OO
on	OO
the	OO
first	OO
step	OO
works	OO
similarly	,O
and	OO
also	OO
takes	OO
eleven	OO
crossings	.O
the	OU
six	OO
animals	OO
escape	OO
unharmed	OO
from	OO
the	OO

i	OU
knew	OO
we	OO

to	OO
get	OO

sand	OO
to	OO
rebuild	OO
what	OO
the	OO

destroyed	.O
but	OU
also	,O
maybe	OO
we	OO
can	OO
use	OO
something	OO
from	OO
inside	OO
the	OO
community	,O
something	OO
we	OO
already	OO
had	.O
i	OU
started	OO
to	OO
put	OO
things	OO
together	.O
first	,U
paper	OO
as	OO
a	OO
filler	,O
instead	OO
of	OO
the	OO
aggregate	OO
we	OO
import	.O
but	OU
that	OO
did	OO
not	OO
work	OO
out	.O
what	OU
about	OO
using	OO
glass	OO
powder	OO
to	OO
replace	OO
part	OO
of	OO
the	OO
cement	?O
but	OU
that	OO
failed	,O
too	.O
i	OU
guessed	OO
making	OO
building	OO
blocks	OO
out	OO
of	OO
mud	OO
would	OO
be	OO
a	OO
great	OO
idea	.O
but	OU
unfortunately	,O
it	OO
didn't	OO
work	OO
out	.O
during	OU
the	OO
process	OO
of	OO
burning	OO
the	OO
mud	OO
blocks	,O
we	OO
had	OO
a	OO
huge	OO
amount	OO
of	OO
ashes	.O
and	OU
i	OU
was	OO
like	,O
why	OU
don't	OO
we	OO
use	OO
those	OO
ashes	?O
the	OU
idea	OO
flashed	OO
in	OO
my	OO
mind	.O
let's	OU
use	OO
it	OO
and	OO
combine	OO
it	OO
with	OO
the	OO
rubble	OO
of	OO
the	OO
demolished	OO
houses	OO
and	OO
make	OO
building	OO
blocks	OO
out	OO
of	OO
it	.O
after	OU
more	OO
than	OO
150	OO
failed	OO
experiments	,O
and	OO
over	OO
six	OO
months	OO
of	OO
research	,O
i	OU
actually	OO
made	OO
it	.O
i	OU
created	OO
a	OO
building	OO
block	OO
out	OO
of	OO
the	OO
ashes	OO
and	OO
rubble	OO
of	OO
the	OO
demolished	OO
houses	.O
it's	OU
here	,O
it	OO
came	OO
all	OO
the	OO
way	OO
with	OO
me	.O
well	,U
it	OO
came	OO
before	OO
me	.O
so	,U
it's	OO
lighter	,O
it's	OO
cheaper	,O
and	OO
it's	OO
stronger	.O
this	OU
building	OO
block	OO
—	OO
of	OO
course	,O
you	OO
ask	OO
yourself	,O
how	OU
did	OO
this	OO
girl	OO
do	OO
it	?O
it's	OU
not	OO
that	OO
hard	,O
and	OO
it's	OO
not	OO
that	OO
easy	.O
first	,U
we	OO
collected	OO
rubble	OO
from	OO
all	OO
around	OO
the	OO
gaza	OU
strip	.U
then	OU
we	OO
combined	OO
it	OO
with	OO
the	OO
ashes	OO
that	OO
came	OO
from	OO
the	OO
landfills	.O
when	OU
the	OO
recipe	OO
is	OO
done	,O
it's	OO
time	OO
for	OO
baking	.O
so	OU
we	OO
mold	OO
the	OO
blocks	,O
as	OO
you	OO
can	OO
see	OO
in	OO
the	OO

and	OO
we	OO

it	OO

i	OU

the	OO

and	OO

now	OO

it	OO
not	OO

to	OO

also	OO
to	OO

we	OO
were	OO

to	OO

the	OO

which	OO

this	OU

not	OO
just	OO
only	OO
a	OO
building	OO

it	OU

their	OO

it	OO

me	.O
after	OU
this	OO

with	OO
the	OO

and	OO
after	OO
two	OO
years	,O
what	OO

not	OO
just	OO
building	OO

we	OU
also	OO

we	OO
need	OO
the	OO

i	OU

a	OO

the	OO

off	OO

by	OO

15	OO

we	OO

in	OO
a	OO

the	OU
next	OO

i	OU
came	OO
to	OO
check	OO
what	OO

with	OO
the	OO

and	OO
i	OU
found	OO
a	OO
whole	OO

watching	OO
a	OO

using	OO
our	OO

i	OU
was	OO
like	,O
wow	,U
that's	OO
going	OO
to	OO
create	OO
a	OO
huge	OO
impact	OO
in	OO
the	OO

that	OU
encouraged	OO
us	OO
to	OO
go	OO
to	OO
the	OO
second	OO
round	OO
of	OO
bringing	OO
200	OO
units	.O
but	OU
each	OO
unit	OO
costs	OO
around	OO
350	OO
dollars	.O
and	OU
a	OO
palestinian	OU
family	OO
can't	OO
afford	OO
the	OO
350	OO
dollars	.O
so	OU
we	OO
had	OO
to	OO
think	,O
again	,O
outside	OO
the	OO
box:	OO
how	OU
can	OO
we	OO
make	OO
this	OO
happen	?O
if	OU
a	OO
whole	OO
neighborhood	OO
can	OO
watch	OO
a	OO
football	OO
match	OO
using	OO
one	OO
device	,O
it	OO
means	OO
two	,O
three	OO
and	OO
four	OO
families	OO
can	OO
share	OO
one	OO
device	OO
and	OO
enjoy	OO
the	OO
electricity	.O
what	OU
we	OO
did	OO
is	,O
we	OO
created	OO
a	OO
new	OO
business	OO
model	OO
called	OO
sharing	OO
is	OO
caring	.O
the	OU
sharing	OO
is	OO
caring	OO
business	OO
model	OO
says	OO
two	OO
families	OO
share	OO
one	OO
unit	,O
three	OO
families	OO
share	OO
one	OO
unit	,O
and	OO
they	OO
split	OO
the	OO
cost	,O
so	OO
they	OO
can	OO
afford	OO
paying	OO
for	OO
it	.O
well	,U
the	OO
idea	OO
caught	OO
on	.O
i	OU
didn't	OO
expect	OO
that	,O
but	OO
it	OO
just	OO
happened	.O
in	OU
less	OO
than	OO
two	OO
weeks	,O
we	OO
were	OO
able	OO
to	OO
provide	OO
over	OO
200	OO

with	OO
electricity	.O
and	OU
the	OO
question	OO
here:	OO
how	OU
did	OO
the	OO
idea	OO
catch	OO
on	?O
we	OU
went	OO
to	OO

centers	OO
—	OO
those	OO

places	,O
you	OO

for	OO

it	OO
was	OO
so	OO
weird	OO
for	OO
a	OO

to	OO
go	OO
there	.O
and	OU
i	OU

we	OU

we	OU

you	OO

you	OO

us	OO

who	OO

now	,U

how	OO

we	OU
will	OO
find	OO
that	OO

what	OU

people	OO
use	OO
likes	OO
to	OO
target	OO
propaganda	OO
at	OO
you	OO
before	OO
they	OO
use	OO
your	OO
zip	OO
code	OO
or	OO
your	OO
gender	OO
or	OO
your	OO
age	,O
because	OO
the	OO
idea	OO
of	OO
targeting	OO
people	OO
with	OO
propaganda	OO
for	OO
political	OO
purposes	OO
is	OO
as	OO
old	OO
as	OO
politics	.O
and	OU
the	OO
reason	OO
why	OO
that	OO
idea	OO
is	OO
there	OO
is	OO
because	OO
democracy	OO
has	OO
a	OO
basic	OO
vulnerability	.O
this	OU
is	OO
the	OO
idea	OO
of	OO
a	OO
representative	.O
in	OU
principle	,O
democracy	OO
is	OO
the	OO
ability	OO
of	OO
people	OO
to	OO
exert	OO
power	.O
but	OU
in	OO
practice	,O
we	OO
have	OO
to	OO
delegate	OO
that	OO
power	OO
to	OO
a	OO
representative	OO
that	OO
can	OO
exert	OO
that	OO
power	OO
for	OO
us	.O
that	OU
representative	OO
is	OO
a	OO
bottleneck	,O
or	OO
a	OO
weak	OO
spot	.O
it	OU
is	OO
the	OO
place	OO
that	OO
you	OO
want	OO
to	OO
target	OO
if	OO
you	OO
want	OO
to	OO
attack	OO
democracy	OO
because	OO
you	OO
can	OO
capture	OO
democracy	OO
by	OO
either	OO
capturing	OO
that	OO
representative	OO
or	OO
capturing	OO
the	OO
way	OO
that	OO
people	OO
choose	OO
it	.O
so	OU
the	OO
big	OO
question	OO
is:	OO
is	OU
this	OO
the	OO
end	OO
of	OO
history	?O
is	OU
this	OO
the	OO
best	OO
that	OO
we	OO
can	OO
do	OO
or	,O
actually	,O
are	OO
there	OO
alternatives	?O
some	OU
people	OO
have	OO
been	OO
thinking	OO
about	OO
alternatives	,O
and	OO
one	OO
of	OO
the	OO
ideas	OO
that	OO
is	OO
out	OO
there	OO
is	OO
the	OO
idea	OO
of	OO
direct	OO
democracy	.O
this	OU
is	OO
the	OO
idea	OO
of	OO
bypassing	OO
politicians	OO
completely	OO
and	OO
having	OO
people	OO
vote	OO
directly	OO
on	OO
issues	,O
having	OO
people	OO
vote	OO
directly	OO
on	OO
bills	.O
but	OU
this	OO
idea	OO
is	OO
naive	OO
because	OO
there's	OO
too	OO
many	OO
things	OO
that	OO
we	OO
would	OO
need	OO
to	OO
choose	.O
if	OU
you	OO
look	OO
at	OO
the	OO
114th	OO
us	OU
congress	,U
you	OO
will	OO
have	OO
seen	OO
that	OO
the	OO
house	OU
of	OO
representatives	OU
considered	OO
more	OO
than	OO
6,000	OO
bills	,O
the	OO
senate	OU
considered	OO
more	OO
than	OO
3,000	OO
bills	OO
and	OO
they	OO
approved	OO
more	OO
than	OO
300	OO
laws	.O
those	OU
would	OO
be	OO
many	OO
decisions	OO
that	OO
each	OO
person	OO
would	OO
have	OO
to	OO
make	OO
a	OO
week	OO
on	OO
topics	OO
that	OO
they	OO
know	OO
little	OO
about	.O
so	OU
there's	OO
a	OO
big	OO
cognitive	OO
bandwidth	OO
problem	OO
if	OO
we're	OO
going	OO
to	OO
try	OO
to	OO
think	OO
about	OO
direct	OO
democracy	OO
as	OO
a	OO
viable	OO
alternative	.O
so	OU
some	OO
people	OO
think	OO
about	OO
the	OO
idea	OO
of	OO
liquid	OO
democracy	,O
or	OO
fluid	OO
democracy	,O
which	OO
is	OO
the	OO
idea	OO
that	OO
you	OO
endorse	OO
your	OO
political	OO
power	OO
to	OO
someone	,O
who	OO
can	OO
endorse	OO
it	OO
to	OO
someone	OO
else	,O
and	,O
eventually	,O
you	OO
create	OO
a	OO
large	OO
follower	OO
network	OO
in	OO
which	,O
at	OO
the	OO
end	,O
there's	OO
a	OO
few	OO
people	OO
that	OO
are	OO
making	OO
decisions	OO
on	OO
behalf	OO
of	OO
all	OO
of	OO
their	OO
followers	OO
and	OO
their	OO
followers	.O
but	OU
this	OO
idea	OO
also	OO
doesn't	OO
solve	OO
the	OO
problem	OO
of	OO
the	OO
cognitive	OO
bandwidth	OO
and	,O
to	OO
be	OO
honest	,O
it's	OO
also	OO
quite	OO
similar	OO
to	OO
the	OO
idea	OO
of	OO
having	OO
a	OO
representative	.O
so	OU
what	OO
i'm	OU
going	OO
to	OO
do	OO
today	OO
is	OO
i'm	OU
going	OO
to	OO
be	OO
a	OO
little	OO
bit	OO
provocative	,O
and	OO
i'm	OU
going	OO
to	OO
ask	OO
you	,O
well:	OO
what	OU
if	,O
instead	OO
of	OO
trying	OO
to	OO
bypass	OO
politicians	,O
we	OO
tried	OO
to	OO
automate	OO
them	?O
the	OU
idea	OO
of	OO
automation	OO
is	OO
not	OO
new	.O
it	OU
was	OO
started	OO
more	OO
than	OO
300	OO
years	OO
ago	,O
when	OO
french	OU
weavers	OO
decided	OO
to	OO
automate	OO
the	OO
loom	.O
the	OU
winner	OO
of	OO
that	OO
industrial	OO
war	OO
was	OO
joseph	OU
marie	OU
jacquard	.U
he	OU
was	OO
a	OO
french	OU
weaver	OO
and	OO
merchant	OO
that	OO
married	OO
the	OO
loom	OO
with	OO
the	OO
steam	OO
engine	OO
to	OO
create	OO
autonomous	OO
looms	.O
and	OU
in	OO
those	OO
autonomous	OO
looms	,O
he	OO
gained	OO
control	.O
he	OU
could	OO
now	OO
make	OO
fabrics	OO
that	OO
were	OO
more	OO
complex	OO
and	OO
more	OO
sophisticated	OO
than	OO
the	OO
ones	OO
they	OO
were	OO
able	OO
to	OO
do	OO
by	OO
hand	.O
but	OU
also	,O
by	OO
winning	OO
that	OO
industrial	OO
war	,O
he	OO
laid	OO
out	OO
what	OO
has	OO
become	OO
the	OO
blueprint	OO
of	OO
automation	.O
the	OU
way	OO
that	OO
we	OO
automate	OO
things	OO
for	OO
the	OO
last	OO
300	OO
years	OO
has	OO
always	OO
been	OO
the	OO
same:	OO
we	OO
first	OO
identify	OO
a	OO
need	,O
then	OO
we	OO
create	OO
a	OO
tool	OO
to	OO
satisfy	OO
that	OO
need	,O
like	OO
the	OO
loom	,O
in	OO
this	OO
case	,O
and	OO
then	OO
we	OO
study	OO
how	OO
people	OO
use	OO
that	OO
tool	OO
to	OO
automate	OO
that	OO
user	.O
that's	OU
how	OO
we	OO
came	OO
from	OO
the	OO
mechanical	OO
loom	OO
to	OO
the	OO
autonomous	OO
loom	,O
and	OO
that	OO
took	OO
us	OO
a	OO
thousand	OO
years	.O
now	,U
it's	OO
taken	OO
us	OO
only	OO
a	OO
hundred	OO
years	OO
to	OO
use	OO
the	OO
same	OO
script	OO
to	OO
automate	OO
the	OO
car	.O
but	OU
the	OO
thing	OO
is	OO
that	,O
this	OO
time	OO
around	,O
automation	OO
is	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
for	OO
real	.O
this	OU
is	OO
a	OO
video	OO
that	OO
a	OO
colleague	OO
of	OO
mine	OO
from	OO
toshiba	OU
shared	OO
with	OO
me	OO
that	OO
shows	OO
the	OO
factory	OO
that	OO
manufactures	OO
solid	OO
state	OO
drives	.O
the	OU
entire	OO
factory	OO
is	OO
a	OO
robot	.O
there	OU
are	OO
no	OO
humans	OO
in	OO
that	OO
factory	.O
and	OU
the	OO
robots	OO
are	OO
soon	OO
to	OO
leave	OO
the	OO
factories	OO
and	OO
become	OO
part	OO
of	OO
our	OO
world	,O
become	OO
part	OO
of	OO
our	OO
workforce	.O
so	OU
what	OO
i	OU
do	OO
in	OO
my	OO
day	OO
job	OO
is	OO
actually	OO
create	OO
tools	OO
that	OO
integrate	OO
data	OO
for	OO
entire	OO
countries	OO
so	OO
that	OO
we	OO
can	OO
ultimately	OO
have	OO
the	OO
foundations	OO
that	OO
we	OO
need	OO
for	OO
a	OO
future	OO
in	OO
which	OO
we	OO
need	OO
to	OO
also	OO
manage	OO
those	OO
machines	.O
but	OU
today	,O
i'm	OU
not	OO
here	OO
to	OO
talk	OO
to	OO
you	OO
about	OO
these	OO
tools	OO
that	OO
integrate	OO
data	OO
for	OO
countries	.O
but	OU
i'm	OU
here	OO
to	OO
talk	OO
to	OO
you	OO
about	OO
another	OO
idea	OO
that	OO
might	OO
help	OO
us	OO
think	OO
about	OO
how	OO
to	OO
use	OO
artificial	OO
intelligence	OO
in	OO
democracy	.O
because	OU
the	OO
tools	OO
that	OO
i	OU
build	OO
are	OO
designed	OO
for	OO
executive	OO
decisions	.O
these	OU
are	OO
decisions	OO
that	OO
can	OO
be	OO
cast	OO
in	OO
some	OO
sort	OO
of	OO
term	OO
of	OO
objectivity	OO
—	OO
public	OO
investment	OO
decisions	.O
but	OU
there	OO
are	OO
decisions	OO
that	OO
are	OO
legislative	,O
and	OO
these	OO
decisions	OO
that	OO
are	OO
legislative	OO
require	OO
communication	OO
among	OO
people	OO
that	OO
have	OO
different	OO
points	OO
of	OO
view	,O
require	OO
participation	,O
require	OO
debate	,O
require	OO
deliberation	.O
and	OU
for	OO
a	OO
long	OO
time	,O
we	OO
have	OO
thought	OO
that	,O
well	,O
what	OO
we	OO
need	OO
to	OO
improve	OO
democracy	OO
is	OO
actually	OO
more	OO
communication	.O
so	OU
all	OO
of	OO
the	OO
technologies	OO
that	OO
we	OO
have	OO
advanced	OO
in	OO
the	OO
context	OO
of	OO
democracy	,O
whether	OO
they	OO
are	OO
newspapers	OO
or	OO
whether	OO
it	OO
is	OO
social	OO
media	,O
have	OO
tried	OO
to	OO
provide	OO
us	OO
with	OO
more	OO
communication	.O
but	OU
we've	OO
been	OO
down	OO
that	OO
rabbit	OO
hole	,O
and	OO
we	OO
know	OO
that's	OO
not	OO
what's	OO
going	OO
to	OO
solve	OO
the	OO
problem	.O
because	OU
it's	OO
not	OO
a	OO
communication	OO
problem	,O
it's	OO
a	OO
cognitive	OO
bandwidth	OO
problem	.O
so	OU
if	OO
the	OO
problem	OO
is	OO
one	OO
of	OO
cognitive	OO
bandwidth	,O
well	,O
adding	OO
more	OO
communication	OO
to	OO
people	OO
is	OO
not	OO
going	OO
to	OO
be	OO
what's	OO
going	OO
to	OO
solve	OO
it	.O
what	OU
we	OO
are	OO
going	OO
to	OO
need	OO
instead	OO
is	OO
to	OO
have	OO
other	OO
technologies	OO
that	OO
help	OO
us	OO
deal	OO
with	OO
some	OO
of	OO
the	OO
communication	OO
that	OO
we	OO
are	OO
overloaded	OO
with	.O
think	OU
of	,O
like	,O
a	OO
little	OO
avatar	,O
a	OO
software	OO
agent	,O
a	OO
digital	OO
jiminy	OU
cricket	OU
—	OO
that	OO
basically	OO
is	OO
able	OO
to	OO
answer	OO
things	OO
on	OO
your	OO
behalf	.O
and	OU
if	OO
we	OO
had	OO
that	OO
technology	,O
we	OO
would	OO
be	OO
able	OO
to	OO
offload	OO
some	OO
of	OO
the	OO
communication	OO
and	OO
help	,O
maybe	,O
make	OO
better	OO
decisions	OO
or	OO
decisions	OO
at	OO
a	OO
larger	OO
scale	.O
and	OU
the	OO
thing	OO
is	OO
that	OO
the	OO
idea	OO
of	OO
software	OO
agents	OO
is	OO
also	OO
not	OO
new	.O
we	OU
already	OO
use	OO
them	OO
all	OO
the	OO
time	.O
we	OU
use	OO
software	OO
agents	OO
to	OO
choose	OO
the	OO
way	OO
that	OO
we're	OO
going	OO
to	OO
drive	OO
to	OO
a	OO
certain	OO
location	,O
the	OO
music	OO
that	OO
we're	OO
going	OO
to	OO
listen	OO
to	OO
or	OO
to	OO
get	OO
suggestions	OO
for	OO
the	OO
next	OO
books	OO
that	OO
we	OO
should	OO
read	.O
so	OU
there	OO
is	OO
an	OO
obvious	OO
idea	OO
in	OO
the	OO
21st	OO
century	OO
that	OO
was	OO
as	OO
obvious	OO
as	OO
the	OO
idea	OO
of	OO
putting	OO
together	OO
a	OO
steam	OO
engine	OO
with	OO
a	OO
loom	OO
at	OO
the	OO
time	OO
of	OO
jacquard	.U
and	OU
that	OO
idea	OO
is	OO
combining	OO
direct	OO
democracy	OO
with	OO
software	OO
agents	.O
imagine	,U
for	OO
a	OO
second	,O
a	OO
world	OO
in	OO
which	,O
instead	OO
of	OO
having	OO
a	OO
representative	OO
that	OO
represents	OO
you	OO
and	OO
millions	OO
of	OO
other	OO
people	,O
you	OO
can	OO
have	OO
a	OO
representative	OO
that	OO
represents	OO
only	OO
you	,O
with	OO
your	OO
nuanced	OO
political	OO
views	OO
—	OO
that	OO
weird	OO
combination	OO
of	OO
libertarian	OO
and	OO
liberal	OO
and	OO
maybe	OO
a	OO
little	OO
bit	OO
conservative	OO
on	OO
some	OO
issues	OO
and	OO
maybe	OO
very	OO
progressive	OO
on	OO
others	.O
politicians	OU
nowadays	OO
are	OO
packages	,O
and	OO
they're	OO
full	OO
of	OO
compromises	.O
but	OU
you	OO
might	OO
have	OO
someone	OO
that	OO
can	OO
represent	OO
only	OO
you	,O
if	OO
you	OO
are	OO
willing	OO
to	OO
give	OO
up	OO
the	OO
idea	OO
that	OO
that	OO
representative	OO
is	OO
a	OO
human	.O
if	OU
that	OO
representative	OO
is	OO
a	OO
software	OO
agent	,O
we	OO
could	OO
have	OO
a	OO
senate	OO
that	OO
has	OO
as	OO
many	OO
senators	OO
as	OO
we	OO
have	OO
citizens	.O
and	OU
those	OO
senators	OO
are	OO
going	OO
to	OO
be	OO
able	OO
to	OO
read	OO
every	OO
bill	OO
and	OO
they're	OO
going	OO
to	OO
be	OO
able	OO
to	OO
vote	OO
on	OO
each	OO
one	OO
of	OO
them	.O
so	OU
there's	OO
an	OO
obvious	OO
idea	OO
that	OO
maybe	OO
we	OO
want	OO
to	OO
consider	.O
but	OU
i	OU
understand	OO
that	OO
in	OO
this	OO
day	OO
and	OO
age	,O
this	OO
idea	OO
might	OO
be	OO
quite	OO
scary	.O
in	OU
fact	,O
thinking	OO
of	OO
a	OO
robot	OO
coming	OO
from	OO
the	OO
future	OO
to	OO
help	OO
us	OO
run	OO
our	OO
governments	OO
sounds	OO
terrifying	.O
but	OU
we've	OO
been	OO
there	OO
before	.O
and	OU
actually	OO
he	OO
was	OO
quite	OO
a	OO
nice	OO
guy	.O
so	OU
what	OO
would	OO
the	OO
jacquard	OU
loom	OO
version	OO
of	OO
this	OO
idea	OO
look	OO
like	?O
it	OU
would	OO
be	OO
a	OO
very	OO
simple	OO
system	.O
imagine	OU
a	OO
system	OO
that	OO
you	OO
log	OO
in	OO
and	OO
you	OO
create	OO
your	OO
avatar	,O
and	OO
then	OO
you're	OO
going	OO
to	OO
start	OO
training	OO
your	OO
avatar	.O
so	OU
you	OO
can	OO
provide	OO
your	OO
avatar	OO
with	OO
your	OO
reading	OO
habits	,O
or	OO
connect	OO
it	OO
to	OO
your	OO
social	OO
media	,O
or	OO
you	OO
can	OO
connect	OO
it	OO
to	OO
other	OO
data	,O
for	OO
example	OO
by	OO
taking	OO
psychological	OO
tests	.O
and	OU
the	OO
nice	OO
thing	OO
about	OO
this	OO
is	OO
that	OO
there's	OO
no	OO
deception	.O
you	OU
are	OO
not	OO
providing	OO
data	OO
to	OO
communicate	OO
with	OO
your	OO
friends	OO
and	OO
family	OO
that	OO
then	OO
gets	OO
used	OO
in	OO
a	OO
political	OO
system	.O
you	OU
are	OO
providing	OO
data	OO
to	OO
a	OO
system	OO
that	OO
is	OO
designed	OO
to	OO
be	OO
used	OO
to	OO
make	OO
political	OO
decisions	OO
on	OO
your	OO
behalf	.O
then	OU
you	OO
take	OO
that	OO
data	OO
and	OO
you	OO
choose	OO
a	OO
training	OO
algorithm	,O
because	OO
it's	OO
an	OO
open	OO
marketplace	OO
in	OO
which	OO
different	OO
people	OO
can	OO
submit	OO
different	OO
algorithms	OO
to	OO
predict	OO
how	OO
you're	OO
going	OO
to	OO
vote	,O
based	OO
on	OO
the	OO
data	OO
you	OO
have	OO
provided	.O
and	OU
the	OO
system	OO
is	OO
open	,O
so	OO
nobody	OO
controls	OO
the	OO
algorithms;	OO
there	OO
are	OO
algorithms	OO
that	OO
become	OO
more	OO
popular	OO
and	OO
others	OO
that	OO
become	OO
less	OO
popular	.O
eventually	,U
you	OO
can	OO
audit	OO
the	OO
system	.O
you	OU
can	OO
see	OO
how	OO
your	OO
avatar	OO
is	OO
working	.O
if	OU
you	OO
like	OO
it	,O
you	OO
can	OO
leave	OO
it	OO
on	OO
autopilot	.O
if	OU
you	OO
want	OO
to	OO
be	OO
a	OO
little	OO
more	OO
controlling	,O
you	OO
can	OO
actually	OO
choose	OO
that	OO
they	OO
ask	OO
you	OO
every	OO
time	OO
they're	OO
going	OO
to	OO
make	OO
a	OO
decision	,O
or	OO
you	OO
can	OO
be	OO
anywhere	OO
in	OO
between	.O
one	OU
of	OO
the	OO
reasons	OO
why	OO
we	OO
use	OO
democracy	OO
so	OO
little	OO
may	OO
be	OO
because	OO
democracy	OO
has	OO
a	OO
very	OO
bad	OO
user	OO
interface	.O
and	OU
if	OO
we	OO
improve	OO
the	OO
user	OO

of	OO
democracy	,O
we	OO
might	OO
be	OO
able	OO
to	OO
use	OO
it	OO
more	.O
of	OU

there's	OO
a	OO

that	OO
you	OO

how	OO
do	OO
you	OO

you	OO

the	OO

how	OU
do	OO
you	OO
keep	OO
the	OO
systems	OO
distributed	OO

how	OU
about	OO
my	OO

who's	OO
80	OO
years	OO
old	OO
and	OO
doesn't	OO

how	OO
to	OO
use	OO
the	OO

trust	OU
me	,O
i've	OU
heard	OO
them	OO
all	.O
so	OU
when	OO
you	OO
think	OO
about	OO
an	OO
idea	OO
like	OO
this	,O
you	OO
have	OO
to	OO
beware	OO
of	OO
pessimists	OO
because	OO
they	OO
are	OO
known	OO
to	OO
have	OO
a	OO
problem	OO
for	OO
every	OO
solution	.O
so	OU
i	OU
want	OO
to	OO
invite	OO
you	OO
to	OO
think	OO
about	OO
the	OO
bigger	OO
ideas	.O
the	OU
questions	OO
i	OU
just	OO
showed	OO
you	OO
are	OO
little	OO
ideas	OO
because	OO
they	OO
are	OO
questions	OO
about	OO
how	OO
this	OO
would	OO
not	OO
work	.O
the	OU
big	OO
ideas	OO
are	OO
ideas	OO
of:	OO
what	OU
else	OO
can	OO
you	OO
do	OO
with	OO
this	OO
if	OO
this	OO
would	OO
happen	OO
to	OO
work	?O
and	OU
one	OO
of	OO
those	OO
ideas	OO
is	,O
well	,O
who	OO
writes	OO
the	OO
laws	?O
in	OU
the	OO
beginning	,O
we	OO
could	OO
have	OO
the	OO
avatars	OO
that	OO
we	OO
already	OO
have	,O
voting	OO
on	OO
laws	OO
that	OO
are	OO
written	OO
by	OO
the	OO
senators	OO
or	OO
politicians	OO
that	OO
we	OO
already	OO
have	.O
but	OU
if	OO
this	OO
were	OO
to	OO
work	,O
you	OO
could	OO
write	OO
an	OO
algorithm	OO
that	OO
could	OO
try	OO
to	OO
write	OO
a	OO
law	OO
that	OO
would	OO
get	OO
a	OO
certain	OO
percentage	OO
of	OO
approval	,O
and	OO
you	OO
could	OO
reverse	OO
the	OO
process	.O
now	,U
you	OO
might	OO
think	OO
that	OO
this	OO
idea	OO
is	OO
ludicrous	OO
and	OO
we	OO
should	OO
not	OO
do	OO
it	,O
but	OO
you	OO
cannot	OO
deny	OO
that	OO
it's	OO
an	OO
idea	OO
that	OO
is	OO
only	OO
possible	OO
in	OO
a	OO
world	OO
in	OO
which	OO
direct	OO
democracy	OO
and	OO
software	OO
agents	OO
are	OO
a	OO
viable	OO
form	OO
of	OO
participation	.O
so	OU
how	OO
do	OO
we	OO
start	OO
the	OO
revolution	?O
we	OU
don't	OO
start	OO
this	OO
revolution	OO
with	OO
picket	OO
fences	OO
or	OO
protests	OO
or	OO
by	OO
demanding	OO
our	OO
current	OO
politicians	OO
to	OO
be	OO
changed	OO
into	OO
robots	.O
that's	OU
not	OO
going	OO
to	OO
work	.O
this	OU
is	OO
much	OO
more	OO
simple	,O
much	OO
slower	OO
and	OO
much	OO
more	OO
humble	.O
we	OU
start	OO
this	OO
revolution	OO
by	OO
creating	OO
simple	OO
systems	OO
like	OO
this	OO
in	OO
grad	OO
schools	,O
in	OO
libraries	,O
in	OO
nonprofits	.O
and	OU
we	OO
try	OO
to	OO
figure	OO
out	OO
all	OO
of	OO
those	OO
little	OO
questions	OO
and	OO
those	OO
little	OO
problems	OO
that	OO
we're	OO
going	OO
to	OO
have	OO
to	OO
figure	OO
out	OO
to	OO
make	OO
this	OO
idea	OO
something	OO
viable	,O
to	OO
make	OO
this	OO
idea	OO
something	OO
that	OO
we	OO
can	OO
trust	.O
and	OU
as	OO
we	OO
create	OO
those	OO
systems	OO
that	OO

a	OO

people	,O
a	OO

a	OO
hundred	OO

people	OO
voting	OO
in	OO
ways	OO
that	OO
are	OO
not	OO
politically	OO

we're	OO
going	OO
to	OO
develop	OO
trust	OO
in	OO
this	OO
idea	,O
the	OO
world	OO

going	OO
to	OO
change	,O
and	OO
those	OO
that	OO
are	OO
as	OO

as	OO
my	OO

right	OO
now	OO

to	OO

up	.O
and	OU
by	OO
the	OO

my	OO

my	OO

maybe	OO
this	OO
idea	,O
that	OO

very	OO
crazy	,O

not	OO
be	OO
crazy	OO
to	OO
her	OO

to	OO

and	OU
at	OO
that	OO

we	OO

at	OO
the	OO

they	OO

of	OO

this	OO

it's	OO

quite	OO
a	OO
bit	OO
in	OO

so	OU
this	OO
led	OO
me	OO
to	OO
the	OO
first	OO
ever	OO
ted	,U
back	OO
in	OO
1984	,O
and	OO
it	OO
just	OO

to	OO

a	OO
sony	OU
executive	OO
explaining	OO
how	OO
a	OO

now	,U
it's	OO
really	OO
incredible	OO
to	OO
be	OO
able	OO
to	OO
go	OO
back	OO
in	OO
time	OO
and	OO
access	OO
this	OO

it's	OU
also	OO
really	OO
fascinating	OO
that	OO
after	OO
30	OO
years	,O
after	OO
that	OO
first	OO
ted	,U
we're	OO
still	OO
talking	OO
about	OO

now	,U
if	OO
we	OO

anyone	OO

such	OO
a	OO

all	OO

there's	OU
this	OO

that	OO

we	OO

they're	OU

after	OU

the	OO

we	OO

how	OO

what's	OO

we've	OU

about	OO

you	OU

we	OU

now	.O
there's	OU
a	OO
way	OO
to	OO

it	OU

out	OO
that	OO
there's	OO
a	OO
solution	OO
that's	OO
been	OO
around	OO
for	OO
a	OO
few	OO
billion	OO
years	,O
and	OO
it's	OO
actually	OO
in	OO
this	OO
tube	.O
dna	OU
is	OO
nature's	OO
oldest	OO
storage	OO
device	.O
after	OU
all	,O
it	OO
contains	OO
all	OO
the	OO
information	OO
necessary	OO
to	OO
build	OO
and	OO
maintain	OO
a	OO
human	OO
being	.O
but	OU
what	OO
makes	OO
dna	OU
so	OO
great	?O
well	,U
let's	OO
take	OO
our	OO
own	OO
genome	OO
as	OO
an	OO
example	.O
if	OU
we	OO
were	OO
to	OO
print	OO
out	OO
all	OO
three	OO
billion	OO
a's	,U
t's	,U
c's	OU
and	OO
g's	OU
on	OO
a	OO
standard	OO
font	,O
standard	OO
format	,O
and	OO
then	OO
we	OO
were	OO
to	OO
stack	OO
all	OO
of	OO
those	OO
papers	,O
it	OO
would	OO
be	OO
about	OO
130	OO
meters	OO
high	,O
somewhere	OO
between	OO
the	OO
statue	OU
of	OO
liberty	OU
and	OO
the	OO
washington	OU
monument	.U
now	,U
if	OO
we	OO
converted	OO
all	OO
those	OO
a's	,U
t's	,U
c's	OU
and	OO
g's	OU
to	OO
digital	OO
data	,O
to	OO
zeroes	OO
and	OO
ones	,O
it	OO
would	OO
total	OO
a	OO
few	OO
gigs	.O
and	OU
that's	OO
in	OO
each	OO
cell	OO
of	OO
our	OO
body	.O
we	OU
have	OO
more	OO
than	OO
30	OO
trillion	OO
cells	.O
you	OU
get	OO
the	OO
idea:	OO
dna	OU
can	OO
store	OO
a	OO
ton	OO
of	OO
information	OO
in	OO
a	OO
minuscule	OO
space	.O
dna	OU
is	OO
also	OO
very	OO
durable	,O
and	OO
it	OO
doesn't	OO
even	OO
require	OO
electricity	OO
to	OO
store	OO
it	.O
we	OU
know	OO
this	OO
because	OO
scientists	OO
have	OO
recovered	OO
dna	OU
from	OO
ancient	OO
humans	OO
that	OO
lived	OO
hundreds	OO
of	OO
thousands	OO
of	OO
years	OO
ago	.O
one	OU
of	OO
those	OO
is	OO
ötzi	OU
the	OO
iceman	.U
turns	OU
out	,O
he's	OO
austrian	.U
he	OU
was	OO
found	OO
high	,O
well	OO
preserved	,O
in	OO
the	OO
mountains	OO
between	OO
italy	OU
and	OO
austria	,U
and	OO
it	OO
turns	OO
out	OO
that	OO
he	OO
has	OO
living	OO
genetic	OO
relatives	OO
here	OO
in	OO
austria	OU
today	.O
so	OU
one	OO
of	OO
you	OO
could	OO
be	OO
a	OO
cousin	OO
of	OO
ötzi	.U
the	OU
point	OO
is	OO
that	OO
we	OO
have	OO
a	OO
better	OO
chance	OO
of	OO
recovering	OO
information	OO
from	OO
an	OO
ancient	OO
human	OO
than	OO
we	OO
do	OO
from	OO
an	OO
old	OO
phone	.O
it's	OU
also	OO
much	OO
less	OO
likely	OO
that	OO
we'll	OO
lose	OO
the	OO
ability	OO
to	OO
read	OO
dna	OU
than	OO
any	OO
single	OO
man	OO
made	OO
device	.O
every	OU
single	OO
new	OO
storage	OO

requires	OO
a	OO
new	OO
way	OO
to	OO
read	OO
it	.O
we'll	OU
always	OO
be	OO
able	OO
to	OO
read	OO
dna	.U
if	OU
we	OO
can	OO
no	OO
longer	OO
sequence	,O
we	OO
have	OO
bigger	OO
problems	OO
than	OO
worrying	OO
about	OO
data	OO
storage	.O
storing	OU
data	OO
on	OO
dna	OU
is	OO
not	OO
new	.O
nature's	OU
been	OO
doing	OO
it	OO
for	OO
several	OO
billion	OO
years	.O
in	OU
fact	,O
every	OO
living	OO
thing	OO
is	OO
a	OO
dna	OU
storage	OO
device	.O
but	OU
how	OO
do	OO
we	OO
store	OO
data	OO
on	OO
dna	?U
this	OU
is	OO
photo	OU
51	.O
it's	OU
the	OO
first	OO
ever	OO
photo	OO
of	OO
dna	,U
taken	OO
about	OO
60	OO
years	OO
ago	.O
this	OU
is	OO
around	OO
the	OO
time	OO
that	OO
that	OO
same	OO
hard	OO
drive	OO
was	OO
released	OO
by	OO
ibm	.U
so	OU
really	,O
our	OO
understanding	OO
of	OO
digital	OO
storage	OO
and	OO
of	OO
dna	OU
have	OO
coevolved	.O
we	OU
first	OO
learned	OO
to	OO
sequence	,O
or	OO
read	OO
dna	,U
and	OO
very	OO
soon	OO
after	,O
how	OO
to	OO
write	OO
it	,O
or	OO
synthesize	OO
it	.O
this	OU
is	OO
much	OO
like	OO
how	OO
we	OO
learn	OO
a	OO
new	OO
language	.O
and	OU
now	OO
we	OO
have	OO
the	OO
ability	OO
to	OO
read	,O
write	OO
and	OO
copy	OO
dna	.U
we	OU
do	OO
it	OO
in	OO
the	OO
lab	OO
all	OO
the	OO
time	.O
so	OU
anything	,O
really	OO
anything	,O
that	OO
can	OO
be	OO
stored	OO
as	OO
zeroes	OO
and	OO
ones	OO
can	OO
be	OO
stored	OO
in	OO
dna	.U
to	OU
store	OO
something	OO
digitally	,O
like	OO
this	OO
photo	,O
we	OO
convert	OO
it	OO
to	OO
bits	,O
or	OO
binary	OO
digits	.O
each	OU
pixel	OO
in	OO
a	OO
black	OO
and	OO
white	OO
photo	OO
is	OO
simply	OO
a	OO
zero	OO
or	OO
a	OO
one	.O
and	OU
we	OO
can	OO
write	OO
dna	OU
much	OO
like	OO
an	OO
inkjet	OO
printer	OO
can	OO
print	OO
letters	OO
on	OO
a	OO
page	.O
we	OU
just	OO
have	OO
to	OO
convert	OO
our	OO
data	,O
all	OO
of	OO
those	OO
zeroes	OO
and	OO
ones	,O
to	OO
a's	,U
t's	,U
c's	OU
and	OO
g's	,U
and	OO
then	OO
we	OO
send	OO
this	OO
to	OO
a	OO
synthesis	OO
company	.O
so	OU
we	OO
write	OO
it	,O
we	OO
can	OO
store	OO
it	,O
and	OO
when	OO
we	OO
want	OO
to	OO
recover	OO
our	OO
data	,O
we	OO
just	OO
sequence	OO
it	.O
now	,U
the	OO
fun	OO
part	OO
of	OO
all	OO
of	OO
this	OO
is	OO
deciding	OO
what	OO
files	OO
to	OO
include	.O
we're	OU
serious	OO
scientists	,O
so	OO
we	OO
had	OO
to	OO
include	OO
a	OO

so	OU
once	OO
we	OO

what	OO

we	OO
want	OO
to	OO

we	OO
package	OO
up	OO
the	OO

those	OO

and	OO
ones	OO
to	OO
a's	,U
t's	,U
c's	OU
and	OO
g's	,U
and	OO
then	OO
we	OO
just	OO
send	OO
this	OO

off	OO
to	OO
a	OO
synthesis	OO
company	.O
and	OU
this	OO
is	OO
what	OO
we	OO
got	OO
back	.O
our	OU

were	OO
in	OO
this	OO
tube	.O
all	OU
we	OO
had	OO
to	OO
do	OO
was	OO
sequence	OO
it	.O
this	OU
all	OO
sounds	OO
pretty	OO
straightforward	,O
but	OO
the	OO
difference	OO
between	OO
a	OO
really	OO
cool	,O
fun	OO
idea	OO
and	OO
something	OO
we	OO
can	OO
actually	OO
use	OO
is	OO
overcoming	OO
these	OO
practical	OO
challenges	.O
now	,U
while	OO
dna	OU
is	OO
more	OO
robust	OO
than	OO
any	OO
man	OO
made	OO

it's	OO
not	OO
perfect	.O
it	OU
does	OO
have	OO
some	OO
weaknesses	.O
we	OU
recover	OO
our	OO
message	OO
by	OO
sequencing	OO
the	OO
dna	,U
and	OO
every	OO
time	OO
data	OO
is	OO
retrieved	,O
we	OO
lose	OO
the	OO
dna	.U
that's	OU
just	OO
part	OO
of	OO
the	OO
sequencing	OO
process	.O
we	OU
don't	OO
want	OO
to	OO
run	OO
out	OO
of	OO
data	,O
but	OO
luckily	,O
there's	OO
a	OO
way	OO
to	OO
copy	OO
the	OO
dna	OU
that's	OO
even	OO
cheaper	OO
and	OO
easier	OO
than	OO
synthesizing	OO
it	.O
we	OU
actually	OO
tested	OO
a	OO
way	OO
to	OO
make	OO
200	OO
trillion	OO
copies	OO
of	OO
our	OO
files	,O
and	OO
we	OO
recovered	OO
all	OO
the	OO
data	OO
without	OO
error	.O
so	OU
sequencing	OO
also	OO
introduces	OO
errors	OO
into	OO
our	OO
dna	,U
into	OO
the	OO
a's	,U
t's	,U
c's	OU

nature	OU
has	OO
a	OO
way	OO
to	OO
deal	OO
with	OO
this	OO
in	OO
our	OO

but	OU
our	OO
data	OO
is	OO
stored	OO
in	OO
synthetic	OO
dna	OU
in	OO
a	OO

so	OO
we	OO
had	OO
to	OO
find	OO
our	OO
own	OO
way	OO
to	OO
overcome	OO
this	OO
problem	.O
we	OU
decided	OO
to	OO
use	OO
an	OO
algorithm	OO
that	OO
was	OO
used	OO
to	OO
stream	OO
videos	.O
when	OU
you're	OO
streaming	OO
a	OO

you're	OO
essentially	OO
trying	OO
to	OO
recover	OO
the	OO

the	OO
original	OO

when	OU
we're	OO
trying	OO
to	OO
recover	OO
our	OO
original	OO

we're	OO
simply	OO
sequencing	.O
but	OU
really	,O
both	OO
of	OO
these	OO

are	OO
about	OO
recovering	OO
enough	OO
zeroes	OO
and	OO
ones	OO
to	OO
put	OO
our	OO

back	OO
together	.O
and	OU
so	,O
because	OO
of	OO
our	OO
coding	OO
strategy	,O
we	OO
were	OO
able	OO
to	OO
package	OO
up	OO
all	OO
of	OO
our	OO
data	OO
in	OO
a	OO
way	OO
that	OO
allowed	OO
us	OO
to	OO
make	OO
millions	OO

still	OO
always	OO

if	OU

that	OO
this	OO

at	OO
explaining	OO
the	OO

you	OO

for	OU
centuries	,O
this	OO
was	OO
central	OO
to	OO
how	OO
europe	OU
and	OO
the	OO
islamic	OU
world	OO
saw	OO
the	OO
universe	.O
but	OU
in	OO
1543	,O
a	OO
guy	OO
named	OO
copernicus	OU
proposed	OO
a	OO
different	OO
model	.O
he	OU
believed	OO
that	OO
the	OO
sun	OO
was	OO
at	OO
the	OO
center	OO
of	OO
the	OO
universe	.O
this	OU
radically	OO
new	OO
idea	OO
was	OO
hard	OO
for	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
people	OO
to	OO
accept	.O
after	OU
all	,O
aristotle's	OU
ideas	OO
made	OO
sense	OO
with	OO
what	OO
they	OO
could	OO
see	,O
and	OO
they	OO
were	OO
pretty	OO
flattering	OO
to	OO
humans	.O
but	OU
a	OO
series	OO
of	OO
subsequent	OO
discoveries	OO
made	OO
the	OO
sun	OO
centric	OO
model	OO
hard	OO
to	OO
ignore	.O
first	,U
johannes	OU
kepler	OU
pointed	OO
out	OO
that	OO
orbits	OO
aren't	OO
perfect	OO
circles	OO
or	OO
spheres	.O
then	,U
galileo's	OU
telescope	OO
caught	OO
jupiter's	OU
moons	OO
orbiting	OO
around	OO
jupiter	,U
totally	OO
ignoring	OO
earth	.U
and	OU
then	,O
newton	OU
proposed	OO
the	OO
theory	OO
of	OO
universal	OO
gravitation	,O
demonstrating	OO
that	OO
all	OO
objects	OO
are	OO
pulling	OO
on	OO
each	OO
other	.O
eventually	,U
we	OO
had	OO
to	OO
let	OO
go	OO
of	OO
the	OO
idea	OO
that	OO
we	OO
were	OO
at	OO
the	OO
center	OO
of	OO
the	OO
universe	.O
shortly	OU
after	OO
copernicus	,U
in	OO
the	OO
1580s	,O
an	OO
italian	OU
friar	,O
giordano	OU
bruno	,U
suggested	OO
the	OO
stars	OO
were	OO
suns	OO
that	OO
likely	OO
had	OO
their	OO
own	OO
planets	OO
and	OO
that	OO
the	OO
universe	OO
was	OO
infinite	.O
this	OU
idea	OO
didn't	OO
go	OO
over	OO
well	.O
bruno	OU
was	OO
burned	OO
at	OO
the	OO
stake	OO
for	OO
his	OO
radical	OO
suggestion	.O
centuries	OU
later	,O
the	OO
philosopher	OO
rene	OU
descartes	OU
proposed	OO
that	OO
the	OO
universe	OO
was	OO
a	OO
series	OO
of	OO
whirlpools	,O
which	OO
he	OO
called	OO
vortices	,O
and	OO
that	OO
each	OO
star	OO
was	OO
at	OO
the	OO
center	OO
of	OO
a	OO
whirlpool	.O
in	OU
time	,O
we	OO
realized	OO
there	OO
were	OO
far	OO
more	OO
stars	OO
than	OO
aristotle	OU
ever	OO
dreamed	.O
as	OU
astronomers	OO
like	OO
william	OU
herschel	OU
got	OO
more	OO
and	OO
more	OO
advanced	OO
telescopes	,O
it	OO
became	OO
clear	OO
that	OO
our	OO
sun	OO
is	OO
actually	OO
one	OO
of	OO
many	OO
stars	OO
inside	OO
the	OO
milky	OU

and	OU
those	OO

we	OO

they're	OU

just	OO
as	OO

maybe	OU
we're	OO
farther	OO
from	OO
the	OO

than	OO
we	OO
ever	OO
realized	.O
in	OU
the	OO
1920s	,O
astronomers	OO
studying	OO
the	OO

wanted	OO
to	OO
figure	OO

everything	OU

30	.O
it's	OU

it	OO
more	OO
interesting	OO
by	OO
thinking	OO
about	OO
which	OO
of	OO
these	OO
numbers	OO
are	OO
also	OO
factors	OO
of	OO
each	OO
other	OO
and	OO
drawing	OO
a	OO
picture	,O
a	OO
bit	OO
like	OO
a	OO
family	OO
tree	,O
to	OO
show	OO
those	OO
relationships	.O
so	OU
30	OO
is	OO
going	OO
to	OO
be	OO
at	OO
the	OO
top	OO
like	OO
a	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
great	OO
grandparent	.O
six	,U
10	OO
and	OO
15	OO
go	OO
into	OO
30	.O
five	OU
goes	OO
into	OO
10	OO
and	OO
15	.O
two	OU
goes	OO
into	OO
six	OO
and	OO
10	.O
three	OU
goes	OO
into	OO
six	OO
and	OO
15	.O
and	OU
one	OO
goes	OO
into	OO
two	,O
three	OO
and	OO
five	.O
so	OU
now	OO
we	OO
see	OO
that	OO
10	OO
is	OO
not	OO
divisible	OO
by	OO
three	,O
but	OO
that	OO
this	OO
is	OO
the	OO
corners	OO
of	OO
a	OO
cube	,O
which	OO
is	,O
i	OU
think	,O
a	OO
bit	OO
more	OO
interesting	OO
than	OO
a	OO
bunch	OO
of	OO
numbers	OO
in	OO
a	OO
straight	OO
line	.O
we	OU
can	OO
see	OO
something	OO
more	OO
here	.O
there's	OU
a	OO
hierarchy	OO
going	OO
on	.O
at	OU
the	OO
bottom	OO
level	OO
is	OO
the	OO
number	OO
one	,O
then	OO
there's	OO
the	OO
numbers	OO
two	,O
three	OO
and	OO
five	,O
and	OO
nothing	OO
goes	OO
into	OO
those	OO
except	OO
one	OO
and	OO
themselves	.O
you	OU
might	OO
remember	OO
this	OO
means	OO
they're	OO
prime	.O
at	OU
the	OO
next	OO
level	OO
up	,O
we	OO
have	OO
six	,O
10	OO
and	OO
15	,O
and	OO
each	OO
of	OO
those	OO
is	OO
a	OO
product	OO
of	OO
two	OO
prime	OO
factors	.O
so	OU
six	OO
is	OO
two	OO
times	OO
three	,O
10	OO
is	OO
two	OO
times	OO
five	,O
15	OO
is	OO
three	OO
times	OO
five	.O
and	OU
then	OO
at	OO
the	OO
top	,O
we	OO
have	OO
30	,O
which	OO
is	OO
a	OO
product	OO
of	OO
three	OO
prime	OO
numbers	OO
—	OO
two	OO
times	OO
three	OO
times	OO
five	.O
so	OU
i	OU
could	OO
redraw	OO
this	OO
diagram	OO
using	OO
those	OO
numbers	OO
instead	.O
we	OU
see	OO
that	OO
we've	OO
got	OO
two	,O
three	OO
and	OO
five	OO
at	OO
the	OO
top	,O
we	OO
have	OO
pairs	OO
of	OO
numbers	OO
at	OO
the	OO
next	OO
level	,O
and	OO
we	OO
have	OO
single	OO
elements	OO
at	OO
the	OO
next	OO
level	OO
and	OO
then	OO
the	OO
empty	OO
set	OO
at	OO
the	OO
bottom	.O
and	OU
each	OO
of	OO
those	OO
arrows	OO
shows	OO
losing	OO
one	OO
of	OO
your	OO
numbers	OO
in	OO
the	OO
set	.O
now	OU
maybe	OO
it	OO
can	OO
be	OO
clear	OO
that	OO
it	OO
doesn't	OO
really	OO
matter	OO
what	OO
those	OO
numbers	OO
are	.O
in	OU
fact	,O
it	OO
doesn't	OO
matter	OO
what	OO
they	OO
are	.O
so	OU
we	OO
could	OO
replace	OO
them	OO
with	OO
something	OO
like	OO
a	,U
b	OU
and	OO
c	OU
instead	,O
and	OO
we	OO
get	OO
the	OO
same	OO
picture	.O
so	OU
now	OO
this	OO
has	OO
become	OO
very	OO
abstract	.O
the	OU
numbers	OO
have	OO
turned	OO
into	OO
letters	.O
but	OU
there	OO
is	OO
a	OO
point	OO
to	OO
this	OO
abstraction	,O
which	OO
is	OO
that	OO
it	OO
now	OO
suddenly	OO
becomes	OO
very	OO
widely	OO
applicable	,O
because	OO
a	,U
b	OU
and	OO
c	OU
could	OO
be	OO
anything	.O
for	OU
example	,O
they	OO
could	OO
be	OO
three	OO
types	OO
of	OO
privilege:	OO
rich	,O
white	OO
and	OO
male	.O
so	OU
then	OO
at	OO
the	OO
next	OO
level	,O
we	OO
have	OO
rich	OO
white	OO
people	.O
here	OU
we	OO
have	OO
rich	OO
male	OO
people	.O
here	OU
we	OO
have	OO
white	OO
male	OO
people	.O
then	OU
we	OO
have	OO
rich	,O
white	OO
and	OO
male	.O
and	OU
finally	,O
people	OO
with	OO
none	OO
of	OO
those	OO
types	OO
of	OO
privilege	.O
and	OU
i'm	OU
going	OO
to	OO
put	OO
back	OO
in	OO
the	OO
rest	OO
of	OO
the	OO
adjectives	OO
for	OO
emphasis	.O
so	OU
here	OO
we	OO
have	OO
rich	,O
white	OO
non	OO
male	OO
people	,O
to	OO
remind	OO
us	OO
that	OO
there	OO
are	OO
nonbinary	OO
people	OO
we	OO
need	OO
to	OO
include	.O
here	OU
we	OO
have	OO
rich	,O
nonwhite	OO

people	.O
here	OU
we	OO

non	OO

and	OU
at	OO
the	OO

with	OO
the	OO
least	OO
privilege	,O
non	OO
rich	,O
nonwhite	,O
non	OO
male	OO
people	.O
we	OU
have	OO
gone	OO
from	OO
a	OO
diagram	OO
of	OO
factors	OO
of	OO
30	OO
to	OO
a	OO
diagram	OO
of	OO
interaction	OO
of	OO
different	OO
types	OO
of	OO
privilege	.O
and	OU
there	OO
are	OO
many	OO
things	OO
we	OO
can	OO
learn	OO
from	OO
this	OO
diagram	,O
i	OU
think	.O
the	OU
first	OO
is	OO
that	OO
each	OO
arrow	OO
represents	OO
a	OO
direct	OO
loss	OO
of	OO
one	OO
type	OO
of	OO
privilege	.O
sometimes	OU
people	OO
mistakenly	OO
think	OO
that	OO
white	OO
privilege	OO
means	OO
all	OO
white	OO
people	OO
are	OO
better	OO
off	OO
than	OO
all	OO
nonwhite	OO
people	.O
some	OU
people	OO
point	OO
at	OO
superrich	OO
black	OO
sports	OO
stars	OO
and	OO
say	,O
see	?U
they're	OU
really	OO
rich	.O
white	OU
privilege	OO
doesn't	OO
exist	.O
but	OU
that's	OO
not	OO
what	OO
the	OO
theory	OO
of	OO
white	OO
privilege	OO
says	.O
it	OU
says	OO
that	OO
if	OO
that	OO
superrich	OO
sports	OO
star	OO
had	OO
all	OO
the	OO
same	OO
characteristics	OO
but	OO
they	OO
were	OO
also	OO
white	,O
we	OO
would	OO
expect	OO
them	OO
to	OO
be	OO
better	OO
off	OO
in	OO
society	.O
there	OU
is	OO
something	OO
else	OO
we	OO
can	OO
understand	OO
from	OO
this	OO
diagram	OO
if	OO
we	OO
look	OO
along	OO
a	OO
row	.O
if	OU
we	OO
look	OO
along	OO
the	OO
second	OO
to	OO
top	OO
row	,O
where	OO
people	OO
have	OO
two	OO
types	OO
of	OO
privilege	,O
we	OO
might	OO
be	OO
able	OO
to	OO
see	OO
that	OO
they're	OO
not	OO
all	OO
particularly	OO
equal	.O
for	OU
example	,O
rich	OO
white	OO
women	OO
are	OO
probably	OO
much	OO
better	OO
off	OO
in	OO
society	OO
than	OO
poor	OO
white	OO
men	,O
and	OO
rich	OO
black	OO
men	OO
are	OO
probably	OO
somewhere	OO
in	OO
between	.O
so	OU
it's	OO
really	OO
more	OO
skewed	OO
like	OO
this	,O
and	OO
the	OO
same	OO
on	OO
the	OO
bottom	OO
level	.O
but	OU
we	OO
can	OO
actually	OO
take	OO
it	OO
further	OO
and	OO
look	OO
at	OO
the	OO
interactions	OO
between	OO
those	OO
two	OO
middle	OO
levels	.O
because	OU
rich	,O
nonwhite	OO
non	OO
men	OO
might	OO
well	OO
be	OO
better	OO
off	OO
in	OO
society	OO
than	OO
poor	OO
white	OO
men	.O
think	OU
about	OO
some	OO
extreme	OO
examples	,O
like	OO
michelle	OU
obama	,U
oprah	OU
winfrey	.U
they're	OU
definitely	OO
better	OO
off	OO
than	OO
poor	,O
white	,O
unemployed	OO
homeless	OO
men	.O
so	OU
actually	,O
the	OO
diagram	OO
is	OO
more	OO
skewed	OO
like	OO
this	.O
and	OU
that	OO
tension	OO
exists	OO
between	OO
the	OO
layers	OO
of	OO
privilege	OO
in	OO
the	OO
diagram	OO
and	OO
the	OO
absolute	OO
privilege	OO
that	OO
people	OO
experience	OO
in	OO
society	.O
and	OU
this	OO
has	OO
helped	OO
me	OO
to	OO
understand	OO
why	OO
some	OO
poor	OO
white	OO
men	OO
are	OO
so	OO
angry	OO
in	OO
society	OO
at	OO
the	OO
moment	.O
because	OU
they	OO
are	OO
considered	OO
to	OO
be	OO
high	OO
up	OO
in	OO
this	OO
cuboid	OO
of	OO
privilege	,O
but	OO
in	OO
terms	OO
of	OO
absolute	OO
privilege	,O
they	OO
don't	OO
actually	OO
feel	OO
the	OO
effect	OO
of	OO
it	.O
and	OU
i	OU
believe	OO
that	OO
understanding	OO
the	OO
root	OO
of	OO
that	OO
anger	OO
is	OO
much	OO
more	OO
productive	OO
than	OO
just	OO
being	OO
angry	OO
at	OO
them	OO
in	OO
return	.O
seeing	OU
these	OO
abstract	OO
structures	OO
can	OO
also	OO
help	OO
us	OO
switch	OO
contexts	OO
and	OO
see	OO
that	OO
different	OO
people	OO
are	OO
at	OO
the	OO
top	OO
in	OO
different	OO
contexts	.O
in	OU
our	OO
original	OO
diagram	,O
rich	OO
white	OO
men	OO
were	OO
at	OO
the	OO
top	,O
but	OO
if	OO
we	OO
restricted	OO
our	OO
attention	OO
to	OO
non	OO
men	,O
we	OO
would	OO
see	OO
that	OO
they	OO
are	OO
here	,O
and	OO
now	OO
the	OO
rich	,O
white	OO
non	OO
men	OO
are	OO
at	OO
the	OO
top	.O
so	OU
we	OO
could	OO
move	OO
to	OO
a	OO
whole	OO
context	OO
of	OO
women	,O
and	OO
our	OO
three	OO
types	OO
of	OO
privilege	OO
could	OO
now	OO
be	OO
rich	,O
white	OO
and	OO
cisgendered	.O
remember	OU
that	OO
cisgendered	OO
means	OO
that	OO
your	OO
gender	OO
identity	OO
does	OO
match	OO
the	OO
gender	OO
you	OO
were	OO
assigned	OO
at	OO
birth	.O
so	OU
now	OO
we	OO
see	OO
that	OO
rich	,O
white	OO
cis	OO
women	OO
occupy	OO
the	OO
analogous	OO
situation	OO
that	OO
rich	OO
white	OO
men	OO
did	OO
in	OO
broader	OO
society	.O
and	OU
this	OO
has	OO
helped	OO
me	OO
understand	OO
why	OO
there	OO
is	OO
so	OO
much	OO
anger	OO
towards	OO
rich	OO
white	OO
women	,O
especially	OO
in	OO
some	OO
parts	OO
of	OO
the	OO
feminist	OO
movement	OO
at	OO
the	OO
moment	,O
because	OO
perhaps	OO
they're	OO
prone	OO
to	OO
seeing	OO
themselves	OO
as	OO
underprivileged	OO
relative	OO
to	OO
white	OO
men	,O
and	OO
they	OO
forget	OO
how	OO
overprivileged	OO
they	OO
are	OO
relative	OO
to	OO
nonwhite	OO
women	.O
we	OU
can	OO
all	OO
use	OO
these	OO
abstract	OO
structures	OO
to	OO
help	OO
us	OO
pivot	OO
between	OO
situations	OO
in	OO
which	OO
we	OO
are	OO
more	OO
privileged	OO
and	OO
less	OO
privileged	.O
we	OU
are	OO
all	OO
more	OO
privileged	OO
than	OO
somebody	OO
and	OO
less	OO
privileged	OO
than	OO
somebody	OO
else	.O
for	OU
example	,O
i	OU
know	OO
and	OO
i	OU
feel	OO
that	OO
as	OO
an	OO
asian	OU
person	,O
i	OU
am	OO
less	OO
privileged	OO
than	OO
white	OO
people	OO
because	OO
of	OO
white	OO
privilege	.O
but	OU
i	OU
also	OO
understand	OO
that	OO
i	OU
am	OO
probably	OO
among	OO
the	OO
most	OO
privileged	OO
of	OO
nonwhite	OO
people	,O
and	OO
this	OO
helps	OO
me	OO
pivot	OO
between	OO
those	OO
two	OO
contexts	.O
and	OU
in	OO
terms	OO
of	OO
wealth	,O
i	OU
don't	OO
think	OO
i'm	OU
super	OO
rich	.O
i'm	OU
not	OO
as	OO
rich	OO
as	OO
the	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
people	OO
who	OO
don't	OO
have	OO
to	OO
work	.O
but	OU
i	OU
am	OO
doing	OO
fine	,O
and	OO
that's	OO
a	OO
much	OO
better	OO
situation	OO
to	OO
be	OO
in	OO
than	OO
people	OO
who	OO
are	OO
really	OO
struggling	,O
maybe	OO

or	OO
working	OO
at	OO
minimum	OO

i	OU
perform	OO
these	OO

in	OO
my	OO

to	OO
help	OO
me	OO
understand	OO
experiences	OO
from	OO
other	OO
people's	OO
points	OO
of	OO

which	OO
brings	OO
me	OO
to	OO
this	OO
possibly	OO
surprising	OO
conclusion:	OO
that	OO

is	OO
highly	OO
relevant	OO
to	OO

and	OO
can	OO
even	OO
help	OO
us	OO
to	OO
understand	OO
and	OO

with	OO
other	OO
people	.O
my	OU
wish	OO
is	OO
that	OO
everybody	OO
would	OO
try	OO
to	OO
understand	OO
other	OO
people	OO
more	OO
and	OO
work	OO
with	OO
them	OO
together	,O
rather	OO
than	OO
competing	OO
with	OO
them	OO
and	OO
trying	OO
to	OO
show	OO
that	OO
they're	OO
wrong	.O
and	OU
i	OU
believe	OO
that	OO
abstract	OO
mathematical	OO
thinking	OO
can	OO
help	OO
us	OO
achieve	OO
that	.O
thank	OU
you	.O
it's	OU
so	OO
obvious	OO
that	OO
it's	OO
practically	OO
proverbial	.O
you	OU
can't	OO
unboil	OO
an	OO
egg	.O
well	,U
it	OO
turns	OO
out	OO
you	OO
can	,O
sort	OO
of	.O
what	OU
thermal	OO
energy	OO
does	OO
to	OO
the	OO
eggs'	OO
molecules	,O
mechanical	OO
energy	OO
can	OO
undo	.O
eggs	OU
are	OO
mostly	OO
made	OO
of	OO
water	OO
and	OO
proteins	.O
the	OU
proteins	OO
start	OO
off	OO
folded	OO
up	OO
into	OO
intricate	OO
shapes	,O
held	OO
together	OO
by	OO
weak	OO
chemical	OO
bonds	.O
adding	OU
heat	OO
disrupts	OO
those	OO
bonds	,O
allowing	OO
the	OO
proteins	OO
to	OO
unfold	,O
uncoil	,O
unwind	OO
and	OO
wiggle	OO
freely	.O
this	OU
process	OO
is	OO
called	OO
denaturing	.O
the	OU
newly	OO
liberated	OO
proteins	OO
bump	OO
up	OO
against	OO
their	OO
neighbors	OO
and	OO
start	OO
to	OO
form	OO
new	OO
bonds	OO
with	OO
each	OO
other	,O
more	OO
and	OO
more	OO
as	OO
the	OO
heat	OO
increases	,O
until	OO
finally	,O
they're	OO
so	OO
entangled	OO
that	OO
they	OO
gel	OO
into	OO
a	OO
solid	OO
mass	,O
a	OO
boiled	OO
egg	.O
that	OU
entanglement	OO
might	OO
look	OO
permanent	,O
but	OO
it's	OO
not	.O
according	OU
to	OO
a	OO
chemical	OO
idea	OO
called	OO
the	OO
principle	OO
of	OO
microscopic	OO
reversibility	,O
anything	OO
that	OO
happens	,O
like	OO
egg	OO
proteins	OO
seizing	OO
up	,O
can	OO
theoretically	OO
unhappen	OO
if	OO
you	OO
retrace	OO
your	OO
steps	.O
but	OU
adding	OO
more	OO
heat	OO
will	OO
tangle	OO
the	OO
proteins	OO
further	,O
and	OO
cooling	OO
them	OO
down	OO
will	OO
only	OO
freeze	OO
them	,O
so	OO
here's	OO
the	OO
trick:	OO
spin	OO
them	OO
around	OO
ridiculously	OO
fast	.O
i'm	OU
not	OO
kidding	.O
here's	OU
how	OO
it	OO
works	.O
first	,U
scientists	OO
dissolve	OO
boiled	OO
egg	OO
whites	OO
in	OO
water	OO
with	OO
a	OO
chemical	OO
called	OO
urea	,O
a	OO
small	OO
molecule	OO
that	OO
acts	OO
as	OO
a	OO
lubricant	,O
coating	OO
the	OO
proteins'	OO
long	OO
strands	OO
and	OO
making	OO
it	OO
easier	OO
for	OO
them	OO
to	OO
glide	OO
past	OO
each	OO
other	.O
then	,U
they	OO
spin	OO
that	OO
solution	OO
in	OO
a	OO
glass	OO
tube	OO
at	OO
a	OO
breakneck	OO
5000	OO
rotations	OO
per	OO
minute	,O
making	OO
the	OO
solution	OO
spread	OO
out	OO
into	OO
a	OO
thin	OO
film	.O
here's	OU
the	OO
key	OO
part	.O
the	OU
solution	OO
nearest	OO
the	OO
wall	OO
spins	OO
faster	OO
than	OO
the	OO
solution	OO
closer	OO
to	OO
the	OO
middle	.O
that	OU
difference	OO
in	OO
velocity	OO
creates	OO
sheer	OO
stresses	OO
that	OO
repeatedly	OO
stretch	OO
and	OO
contract	OO
the	OO
proteins	OO
until	OO
eventually	OO
they	OO
snap	OO
back	OO
into	OO
their	OO
native	OO
shapes	OO
and	OO
stay	OO
there	.O
by	OU
the	OO
time	OO
the	OO
centrifuge	OO
stops	OO
spinning	,O
the	OO
egg	OO
white	OO
is	OO
back	OO
in	OO
its	OO
original	OO
unboiled	OO
state	.O
this	OU
technique	OO
works	OO
with	OO
all	OO
sorts	OO
of	OO
proteins	.O
bigger	,U
messier	OO
proteins	OO
can	OO
be	OO

this	OU

since	OO

but	OU
the	OO
applications	OO
go	OO

uncooking	OO
your	OO

anyhow	.O
many	OU

consist	OO
of	OO

that	OO

extremely	OO

to	OO

partly	OO
because	OO
they	OO
get	OO
stuck	OO
in	OO

just	OO

this	OU

than	OO

there's	OO

to	OO
keep	OO
in	OO

before	OO
trying	OO
to	OO
uncook	OO
all	OO
of	OO

boiling	OU
an	OO

is	OO
actually	OO
an	OO

because	OO
even	OO
though	OO

changes	OO
the	OO

it	OO

most	OU

are	OO
a	OO

so	OU
you	OO

that	OO

but	OO
they're	OO
not	OO

your	OU

the	OO
way	OO
you	OO
hold	OO
your	OO
body	OO
when	OO
you're	OO
sitting	OO

is	OO
the	OO

for	OO
every	OO

your	OO

these	OU

be	OO
things	OO

and	OU
the	OO
big	OO
one	OO

all	OO

every	OO

gravity	.O
if	OU
your	OO

your	OO

to	OO
work	OO
harder	OO
to	OO
keep	OO
you	OO

some	OU

others	OU
will	OO
be	OO

over	OU

these	OO

your	OO

ability	OO
to	OO
deal	OO
with	OO
the	OO

poor	OU
posture	OO
inflicts	OO
extra	OO
wear	OO

tear	OO
on	OO
your	OO

the	OO

some	OO

researchers	OU
have	OO

poor	OO

though	OO
it	OO

the	OO

of	OO
any	OO
of	OO
them	.O
posture	OU
can	OO
even	OO
influence	OO
your	OO

it's	OO

harder	OO
these	OO

sitting	OU
in	OO
an	OO
awkward	OO

for	OO
a	OO
long	OO

can	OO
promote	OO
poor	OO

and	OO
so	OO
can	OO
using	OO
computers	OO
or	OO

devices	,O
which	OO
encourage	OO
you	OO
to	OO

many	OU

that	,O
on	OO

so	OU
what	OO

when	OU

the	OU

these	OU

if	OU

a	OO

the	OU

we	OO

that	OO

a	OO

it's	OU
the	OO
reason	OO
we	OO

find	OO
geometric	OO

in	OO
the	OO
night	OO

it's	OO
why	OO
we	OO
can	OO
know	OO
without	OO
checking	OO
that	OO
at	OO

two	OO
people	OO
in	OO
london	OU
have	OO
exactly	OO
the	OO
same	OO
number	OO
of	OO

on	OO

it	OO

why	OO

can	OO
be	OO
found	OO
in	OO
just	OO
about	OO
any	OO
text	,O
even	OO
vanilla	OU

so	OU
what	OO
is	OO
ramsey	OU
theory	?O
simply	OU
put	,O
it	OO
states	OO
that	OO

some	OO
particular	OO

as	OU
a	OO

let's	OO

at	OO
what's	OO

the	OO

a	OO
classic	OO

of	OO
ramsey	OU

suppose	OU
there	OO

a	OO

amazingly	OU
enough	,O
we	OO

that	OO
some	OO

of	OO
them	OO
either	OO
all	OO

never	OO
met	OO
before	,O
without	OO
knowing	OO
a	OO

thing	OO
about	OO
them	.O
we	OU
can	OO
demonstrate	OO
that	OO
by	OO
graphing	OO
out	OO
all	OO
the	OO
possibilities	.O
each	OU
point	OO
represents	OO
a	OO
person	,O

a	OO

that	OO
the	OO

every	OU

two	OO

there	OU

a	OO

every	OO

has	OO
the	OO
property	OO
that	OO
we're	OO
looking	OO
for	.O
six	OU
is	OO
the	OO
lowest	OO
number	OO
of	OO

where	OO
that's	OO
guaranteed	OO
to	OO
be	OO
the	OO
case	,O
which	OO
we	OO
can	OO
express	OO
like	OO
this	.O
ramsey	OU
theory	OO
gives	OO
us	OO
a	OO
guarantee	OO
that	OO
such	OO
a	OO
minimum	OO
number	OO
exists	OO
for	OO
certain	OO
patterns	,O
but	OO
no	OO
easy	OO
way	OO
to	OO

it	.O
in	OU
this	OO
case	,O
as	OO
the	OO
total	OO

of	OO

grows	OO
higher	,O
the	OO
combinations	OO
get	OO
out	OO
of	OO

for	OU

say	OO
you're	OO
trying	OO
to	OO
find	OO
out	OO
the	OO
minimum	OO

of	OO
a	OO

where	OO
there's	OO
a	OO

of	OO
five	OO

or	OO
all	OO

despite	OU
five	OO
being	OO
a	OO

the	OO
answer	OO
is	OO
virtually	OO
impossible	OO
to	OO
discover	OO
through	OO
an	OO

like	OO
this	.O
that's	OU
because	OO

the	OO

a	OU

2^	OO

even	OU
with	OO
the	OO

the	OO
best	OO
we	OO
know	OO
is	OO
that	OO
the	OO

this	OO

somewhere	OO
between	OO

49	OO

what	OU
this	OO

us	OO
is	OO
that	OO

from	OO

with	OO
a	OO
very	OO

the	OO

any	OU
four	OO

where	OO

we	OO

it's	OO

what	OO

our	OU

how	OO

the	OU

some	OU
recent	OO
studies	OO

that	OO
the	OO

the	OO

the	OO

there	OU

a	OO

we	OO

that	OO

about	OO

the	OO

that	OU

what	OO

from	OO

one	OO

their	OO

was	.O

i	OU

i	OU

they	OO

that's	OO

out	OO
of	OO
my	OO
fingertips	.O
i	OU
was	OO
alone	OO
in	OO
my	OO
own	OO
head	,O
and	OO
i	OU
felt	OO
the	OO
most	OO
alive	.O
i	OU
didn't	OO
really	OO
know	OO
much	OO
about	OO
the	OO
big	OO
wide	OO
world	OO
then	,O
but	OO
i	OU
knew	OO
that	OO
this	OO
feeling	OO
was	OO
addictive;	OO
and	OO
i	OU
was	OO
going	OO
to	OO
stop	OO
at	OO
nothing	OO
until	OO
i	OU
made	OO
it	OO
my	OO
profession	.O
at	OU
eight	OO
years	OO
old	,O
i	OU
was	OO
enrolled	OO
in	OO
dance	OO
class	.O
and	OU
by	OO
ten	,O
i	OU
informed	OO
my	OO
mother	OO
that	OO
i	OU
didn't	OO
want	OO
to	OO
go	OO
to	OO
school	OO
anymore	.O
i	OU
wanted	OO
to	OO
be	OO
like	OO
billy	OU
elliot	OU
and	OO
go	OO
to	OO
stage	OO
school	.O
this	OU
was	OO
the	OO
first	OO
opportunity	OO
or	OO
challenge	OO
i	OU
was	OO
presented	OO
with	.O
even	OU
as	OO
young	OO
as	OO
ten	,O
i	OU
was	OO
willing	OO
to	OO
give	OO
up	OO
all	OO
of	OO
my	OO
friends	OO
and	OO
go	OO
away	OO
to	OO
board	OO
at	OO
a	OO
private	OO
school	,O
away	OO
from	OO
my	OO
siblings	,O
away	OO
from	OO
my	OO
mom	.O
she	OU
would	OO
repeatedly	OO
ask	OO
me	,O
are	OU
you	OO
sure	OO
this	OO
is	OO
what	OO
you	OO
want	?O
and	OU
to	OO
me	,O
it	OO
was	OO
a	OO
no	OO
brainer	.O
i	OU
didn't	OO
just	OO
want	OO
this;	OO
i	OU
needed	OO
it	.O
my	OU
grubby	OO
knees	OO
and	OO
crooked	OO
teeth	OO
were	OO
not	OO
on	OO
the	OO
list	OO
of	OO
requirements	OO
for	OO
becoming	OO
a	OO
professional	OO
dancer	.O
and	OU
when	OO
i	OU
look	OO
back	OO
now	,O
both	OO
myself	OO
and	OO
my	OO
mother	OO
looked	OO
severely	OO
out	OO
of	OO
place	.O
but	OU
at	OO
the	OO
time	,O
i	OU
was	OO
just	OO
too	OO
young	OO
and	OO
naive	OO
to	OO
feel	OO
inadequate	.O
i	OU
didn't	OO
care	.O
if	OU
billy	OU
elliot	OU
could	OO
do	OO
it	,O
so	OO
could	OO
i	.U
once	OU
my	OO
audition	OO
was	OO
done	,O
i	OU
returned	OO
home	OO
for	OO
two	OO
weeks	OO
of	OO
staring	OO
out	OO
the	OO
window	,O
waiting	OO
for	OO
the	OO
postman	,O
waiting	OO
for	OO
my	OO
ticket	OO
out	OO
of	OO
my	OO
sleepy	OO
village	OO
and	OO
into	OO
a	OO
world	OO
of	OO
jazz	OO
hands	OO
and	OO
dorm	OO
rooms	.O
it	OU
was	OO
good	OO
news	OO
followed	OO
by	OO
bad	OO
news:	OO
i	OU
had	OO
got	OO
in	,O
but	OO
the	OO
fees	OO
to	OO
attend	OO
a	OO
school	OO
like	OO
this	OO
were	OO
not	OO
cheap	,O
and	OO
despite	OO
my	OO
best	OO
efforts	,O
i	OU
had	OO
not	OO
received	OO
any	OO
government	OO
funding	.O
i	OU
auditioned	OO
again	OO
the	OO
following	OO
year	.O
and	OU
this	OO
time	,O
i	OU
received	OO
40%	OO
funding	,O
but	OO
this	OO
was	OO
still	OO
just	OO
money	OO
that	OO
we	OO
didn't	OO
have	,O
and	OO
it	OO
broke	OO
my	OO
heart	.O
i	OU
was	OO
good	OO
enough	.O
i	OU
made	OO
the	OO
cut	.O
but	OU
i	OU
wasn't	OO
going	OO
anywhere	.O
it	OU
was	OO
a	OO
blessing	OO
in	OO
disguise	,O
although	OO
if	OO
anyone	OO
had	OO
said	OO
that	OO
to	OO
me	OO
back	OO
then	,O
i	OU
probably	OO
would've	OO
given	OO
them	OO
the	OO
finger	OO
and	OO
told	OO
them	OO
to	OO
jog	OO
on	.O
i	OU
wasn't	OO
willing	OO
to	OO
give	OO
up	OO
that	OO
easily	.O
so	OU
at	OO
age	OO
11	,O
i	OU
was	OO
bursting	OO
with	OO
excitement	OO
when	OO
my	OO
dance	OO
teacher	OO
informed	OO
me	OO
of	OO
a	OO
talent	OO
show	OO
which	OO
boasted	OO
opportunities	OO
of	OO
making	OO
you	OO
a	OO
star	.O
this	OU
was	OO
the	OO
second	OO
opportunity	OO
i	OU
was	OO
faced	OO
with	.O
i	OU
entered	OO
into	OO
singing	,O
acting	,O
dancing	OO
and	OO
modeling	.O
the	OU
talent	OO
show	OO
consisted	OO
of	OO
workshops	OO
and	OO
seminars	OO
with	OO
specialists	OO
who	OO
would	OO
help	OO
train	OO
you	OO
up	OO
for	OO
your	OO
performance	OO
at	OO
the	OO
end	OO
of	OO
the	OO
week	.O
after	OU
meeting	OO
a	OO
woman	OO
called	OO
louise	OU
johnston	OU
in	OO
an	OO
improvisation	OO
acting	OO
workshop	,O
she	OO
gave	OO
me	OO
the	OO
words	OO
bowling	OO
ball	,O
and	OO
asked	OO
me	OO
to	OO
create	OO
a	OO
short	OO
scene	OO
inspired	OO
by	OO
these	OO
words	.O
after	OU
making	OO
her	OO
laugh	OO
with	OO
a	OO
fictional	OO
story	,O
of	OO
how	OO
i	OU
threw	OO
a	OO
bowling	OO
ball	OO
at	OO
my	OO
brother	OO
and	OO
it	OO
bounced	,O
she	OO
asked	OO
me	OO
to	OO
join	OO
her	OO
acting	OO
agency	.O
i	OU
didn't	OO
really	OO
know	OO
what	OO
this	OO
meant	.O
i	OU
knew	OO
that	OO
i	OU
would	OO
do	OO
auditions	OO
for	OO
films	OO
and	OO
maybe	OO
become	OO
an	OO
actor	,O
but	OO
i	OU
still	OO
had	OO
big	OO
dreams	OO
of	OO
becoming	OO
a	OO
professional	OO
dancer	,O
so	OO
this	OO
woman	OO
was	OO
going	OO
to	OO
have	OO
to	OO
work	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
harder	OO
than	OO
that	OO
if	OO
she	OO
was	OO
going	OO
to	OO
convince	OO
eleven	OO
year	OO
old	OO
me	OO
that	OO
i	OU
was	OO
going	OO
to	OO

an	OO
actress	.O

this	OO
going	OO
to	OO
take	OO
time	OO
away	OO
from	OO
the	OO
30	OO
hours	OO

i	OU

a	OO

the	OO
part	?O
was	OU
this	OO
going	OO
to	OO
be	OO
too	OO
upsetting	?O
and	OU
do	OO
actresses	OO

because	OU
if	OO
they	OO

i'm	OU
yet	OO
to	OO

after	OU

my	OU

i	OU

i	OU

a	OO

and	OO
dark	OO
rings	OO
around	OO
my	OO

that	OO

so	OO
big	OO
they	OO
took	OO
up	OO
half	OO
my	OO

a	OO
hole	OO
in	OO
the	OO

of	OO
my	OO

talking	OO
to	OO
the	OO

it	OO
all	OO

when	OO
i	OU

dancing	OO
in	OO
my	OO

room	,O
i	OU
harnessed	OO
all	OO

in	OO

i	OU
have	OO
absolutely	OO
no	OO
plans	OO
of	OO

down	.O
throughout	OU
my	OO
time	OO
in	OO
this	OO

it	OO

been	OO
a	OO
minefield	.O
i	OU
have	OO
grown	OO
from	OO
a	OO

from	OO
four	OO

i	OU

in	OU
february	OU
of	OO

a	OO

i	OU
were	OO
swigging	OO
beers	OO
in	OO
my	OO
kitchen	,O
and	OO
he	OO
confessed	OO
to	OO
me	OO
that	OO
there	OO
is	OO
a	OO
huge	OO
problem	OO
with	OO
the	OO
creative	OO
industries	.O
i	OU
agreed	.O
the	OU
series	OO
of	OO
events	OO
that	OO
had	OO
got	OO
me	OO
to	OO
that	OO
point	OO
were	OO
based	OO
mainly	OO
on	OO
luck	OO
and	OO
timing	OO
and	OO
were	OO
unable	OO
to	OO
be	OO
recreated	.O
he	OU
suggested	OO
to	OO
me	OO
that	OO
we	OO
create	OO
a	OO
social	OO
media	,O
but	OO
just	OO
for	OO
artists	OO
to	OO
be	OO
able	OO
to	OO
collaborate	OO
with	OO
one	OO
another	OO
and	OO
create	OO
a	OO
career	.O
this	OU
was	OO
the	OO
fourth	OO
opportunity	OO
or	OO
challenge	OO
i	OU
was	OO
presented	OO
with	.O
great	,U
i	OU
thought	.O
how	OU
the	OO
hell	OO
do	OO
we	OO
do	OO
that	?O
and	OU
daisie	OO
was	OO
born	.O
of	OU
course	,O
everyone	OO
who	OO
i	OU
spoke	OO
to	OO
about	OO
my	OO
latest	OO
endeavor	OO
thought	OO
that	OO
i	OU
was	OO
mad;	OO
however	,O
i	OU
know	OO
that	OO
this	OO
is	OO
something	OO
that	OO
i	OU
can	OO
help	OO
change	.O
this	OU
last	OO
year	OO
in	OO
the	OO
industry	,O
we've	OO
seen	OO
a	OO
huge	OO
shift	OO
with	OO
the	OO
me	OU
too	OU
movement	.O
the	OU
industry	OO
is	OO
built	OO
with	OO
gatekeepers	OO
holding	OO
all	OO
of	OO
the	OO
power	OO
and	OO
selecting	OO
who	OO
they	OO
deem	OO
talented	OO
enough	OO
to	OO
advance	OO
to	OO
the	OO
next	OO
level	.O
more	OU
often	OO
than	OO
not	,O
it's	OO
easier	OO
to	OO
catch	OO
the	OO
attention	OO
of	OO
those	OO
people	OO
if	OO
you	OO
have	OO
graduated	OO
from	OO
an	OO
expensive	OO
school	.O
but	OU
even	OO
then	,O
i	OU
have	OO
so	OO
many	OO
friends	OO
who	OO
are	OO
fresh	OO
out	OO
of	OO
art	OO
school	,O
having	OO
trained	OO
for	OO
years	OO
and	OO
are	OO
still	OO
no	OO
closer	OO
to	OO
creating	OO
a	OO
career	.O
now	,U
i'm	OU
not	OO
claiming	OO
that	OO
with	OO
daisie	OO
i	OU
can	OO
make	OO
everybody	OO
a	OO
star	,O
but	OO
i	OU
do	OO
believe	OO
that	OO
the	OO
key	OO
to	OO
success	OO
within	OO
creative	OO
industries	OO
is	OO
collaborating	.O
actors	OU
are	OO
only	OO
as	OO
good	OO
as	OO
their	OO
writers	.O
musicians	OU
are	OO
only	OO
as	OO
strong	OO
as	OO
their	OO
producers	.O
and	OU
designers	OO
need	OO
their	OO
teams	.O
to	OU
start	OO
the	OO
company	,O
we	OO
self	OO
funded	.O
i	OU
had	OO
a	OO
pot	OO
of	OO
cash	OO
from	OO
game	OU
of	OO
thrones	OU
that	OO
i	OU
was	OO
free	OO
to	OO
invest	OO
wherever	OO
i	OU
liked	.O
dom	OU
had	OO
a	OO
series	OO
of	OO
businesses	OO
from	OO
the	OO
age	OO
of	OO
16	,O
which	OO
meant	OO
he	OO
was	OO
also	OO
left	OO
with	OO
a	OO
pot	OO
of	OO
cash	.O
we	OU
threw	OO
our	OO
money	OO
together	OO
50	OO
50	,O
and	OO
we	OO
built	OO
a	OO
team	.O
now	,U
lady	OU
gaga	OU
has	OO
repeatedly	OO
said	OO
that	OO
there	OO
could	OO
be	OO
a	OO
room	OO
of	OO
100	OO
people	,O
and	OO
99	OO
don't	OO
believe	OO
in	OO
you	,O
but	OO
it	OO
just	OO
takes	OO
that	OO
one	OO
person	OO
to	OO
believe	OO
in	OO
you	,O
and	OO
they	OO
can	OO
change	OO
your	OO
life	.O
well	,U
now	OO
we	OO
have	OO
a	OO
team	OO
of	OO
six	.O
over	OU
the	OO
next	OO
16	OO
months	,O
we	OO
built	OO
our	OO
mvp	.U
now	,U
if	OO
you're	OO
wondering	OO
what	OO
an	OO
mvp	OU
is	,O
i	OU
only	OO
found	OO
out	OO
what	OO
it	OO
is	OO
about	OO
six	OO
months	OO
ago	.O
and	OU
from	OO
what	OO
i	OU
can	OO
gather	,O
it's	OO
a	OO
product	OO
which	OO
proves	OO
as	OO
a	OO
problem	OO
worth	OO
solving	OO
with	OO
the	OO
minimum	OO
team	OO
effort	.O
so	OU
basically	OO
from	OO
my	OO
point	OO
of	OO
view	,O
you're	OO
marketing	OO
something	OO
which	OO
you	OO
know	OO
is	OO
going	OO
to	OO
be	OO
good	OO
one	OO
day	,O
but	OO
is	OO
a	OO
little	OO
bit	OO
bad	OO
right	OO
now	.O
and	OU
for	OO
us	,O
that	OO
was	OO
an	OO
ios	OO
app	.O
the	OU
six	OO
of	OO
us	OO
made	OO
an	OO
office	OO
in	OO
dom's	OU
garden	,O
and	OO
on	OO
august	OU
1	,O
2018	,O
we	OO
released	OO
our	OO
version	OO
one	.O
we	OU
had	OO
over	OO
30,000	OO
downloads	OO
in	OO
the	OO
first	OO
24	OO
hours	OO
and	OO
over	OO
30,000	OO
comments	OO
asking	OO
when	OO
the	OO
android	OU
version	OO
was	OO
going	OO
to	OO
be	OO
coming	.O
despite	OU
our	OO
app	OO
being	OO
imperfect	,O
buggy	OO
and	OO
literally	OO
built	OO
by	OO
one	OO
man	OO
alone	,O
this	OO
was	OO
exactly	OO
what	OO
we	OO
needed	OO
for	OO
people	OO
to	OO
invest	.O
we	OU
learned	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
from	OO
our	OO
angry	OO
users	OO
and	OO
our	OO
scary	OO
investors	.O
and	OU
over	OO
the	OO
last	OO
six	OO
months	,O
we	OO
have	OO
grown	OO
our	OO
team	OO
to	OO

we're	OO

that	OO

with	OO

to	OO

it's	OO
a	OO
pleasure	OO
to	OO
be	OO
back	OO
at	OO
tedx	.U
when	OU
i	OU
first	OO
stepped	OO
upon	OO
the	OO
sydney	OU
stage	OO
in	OO
2013	OO
as	OO
a	OO
starry	OO

boy	OO
from	OO

i	OU

no	OO

that	OO
i	OU

about	OO
to	OO

the	OO
most	OO
watched	OO
tedx	OU
presentation	OO
ever	.O
but	OU
you	OO
know	,O
i	OU
was	OO
stoked	OO
because	OO
it	OO
was	OO
completely	OO
unexpected	.O
however	,U
standing	OO
before	OO
you	OO
today	OO
as	OO
a	OO
slightly	OO
inflated	,O
time	OO
battered	OO
version	OO
of	OO
myself	OO
five	OO

i'm	OU
very	OO
confident	.O
confident	OU
that	OO
i'm	OU
about	OO

the	OO
most	OO
instantly	OO

out	OO
on	,O
vomit	OO

talk	OO
of	OO
all	OO

i'm	OU
about	OO
to	OO
show	OO
you	OO
things	OO
that	OO
i	OU
think	OO
you'll	OO
find	OO
hard	OO
to	OO

but	OO
all	OO
in	OO
the	OO

of	OO

first	,U
for	OO
those	OO
unfamiliar	OO
with	OO
what	OO

i	OU
guess	OO
if	OO
you	OO
distilled	OO
it	OO
right	OO
down	OO
to	OO
its	OO
essence	,O
you	OO
would	OO
call	OO
me	OO
a	OO
beatboxer	.O
yo	,U
for	OO
example	.O
here's	OO
a	OO
sample:	OO
thank	OU
you	.O
and	OU
being	OO
a	OO
beatboxer	,O
it	OO
means	OO
that	OO
professionally	,O
i	OU
am	OO
100	OO
percent	OO
reliant	OO
on	OO
the	OO
—	OO
flexibility	OO
of	OO
the	OO
unfiltered	OO
human	OO
voice	.O
and	OU
for	OO
years	,O
my	OO
contemporaries	OO
and	OO
i	OU
have	OO
been	OO
fielding	OO
questions	OO
like	,O
oh	OU
my	OO
god	,U
that's	OO
so	OO
cool	.O
when	OU
did	OO
you	OO
figure	OO
out	OO
you	OO
could	OO
do	OO
that	?O
after	OU
i	OU
practiced	OO
for	OO
thousands	OO
and	OO
thousands	OO
of	OO
hours	OO
—	OO
and	OU
what	OO
do	OO
you	OO
do	OO
for	OO
a	OO
real	OO
job	?O
i'm	OU
a	OO
full	OO
time	OO
beatboxer	,O
your	OU
honor	.U
but	OU
there	OO
is	OO
one	OO
question	OO
that	OO
i	OU
get	OO
quite	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
that's	OO
a	OO
little	OO
bit	OO
more	OO
difficult	OO
to	OO
answer	,O
and	OO
that	OO
is	OO
how	OO
are	OO
you	OO
doing	OO
it	OO
—	OO
how	OO
are	OO
you	OO
making	OO
those	OO
noises	?O
and	OU
i	OU
mean	,O
i	OU
know	OO
muscle	OO
memory	OO
dictates	OO
where	OO
i	OU
position	OO
my	OO
lips	OO
in	OO
order	OO
to	OO
—	OO
but	OO
i	OU
have	OO
no	OO
idea	OO
about	OO
the	OO
inner	OO
mechanics	OO
of	OO
everything	.O
you	OU
know	,O
all	OO
the	OO
flappy	OO
bits	OO
and	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
dangly	OO
things	OO
and	OO
how	OO
they	OO
interact	OO
in	OO
—	OO
in	OO
a	OO
way	OO
that	OO
allows	OO
me	OO
to	OO
—	OO
to	OU
put	OO
it	OO
metaphorically	,O
i	OU
know	OO
how	OO
to	OO
drive	,O
i	OU
just	OO
don't	OO
know	OO
what's	OO
under	OO
the	OO
hood	.O
so	OU
i	OU
decided	OO
to	OO
find	OO
out	OO
and	OO
invite	OO
5,000	OO
captive	OO
strangers	,O
a	OO
few	OO
uncomfortable	OO

everybody	OO
watching	OO

not	OO
even	OO
the	OO
most	OO

of	OO

have	OO
been	.O
my	OO
throat	.O
and	OU
to	OO
help	OO
me	OO
do	OO
that	,O
i'd	OU
like	OO
to	OO
introduce	OO
to	OO
the	OO

a	OO
very	OO
specialist	OO
guest	OO
from	OO

a	OO
man	OO
that's	OO
been	OO
in	OO
my	OO

more	OO
times	OO
than	OO
i'd	OU
care	OO
to	OO
admit	,O
a	OO
legend	OO
of	OO
the	OO

mb:	OU
thank	OU
you	,O
tom	,U
thank	OO
you	.O
and	OU
a	OO
very	OO
good	OO
evening	OO
everyone	.O
it	OU
is	OO
a	OO
pleasure	OO
to	OO
be	OO
here	OO
on	OO
the	OO
tedx	OU

tonight	.O
whoo	.U
tt:	OU
he's	OU
not	OO
warming	OO
up	OO
his	OO
hands	.O
it	OU
doesn't	OO
get	OO
that	OO
intimate	.O
mb:	OU
we	OU
set	OO
out	OO
a	OO
little	OO
while	OO
ago	OO
to	OO
try	OO
to	OO
go	OO
deep	OO
into	OO
the	OO
world	OO
—	OO
and	OO
the	OO
throat	OO
—	OO
of	OO
this	OO
beatboxer	OO
extraordinaire	OO
to	OO
try	OO
to	OO
understand	OO
how	OO
such	OO
a	OO
vast	OO
array	OO
of	OO
sounds	OO
are	OO
humanly	OO
possible	.O
and	OU
what	OO
we	OO
found	OO
—	OO
these	OO
are	OO
going	OO
in	OO
the	OO
mouth	OO
by	OO
the	OO
way	OO
—	OO
and	OO
what	OO
we	OO
found	OO
was	OO
something	OO
absolutely	OO
amazing	.O
even	OU
after	OO
my	OO
two	OO
years	OO
of	OO
laryngeal	OO
surgery	OO
in	OO
harvard	OU
medical	OU
school	OU
with	OO
world	OO
renowned	OO
professor	OO
steven	OU
zeitels	,U
we	OO
never	OO
saw	OO
anything	OO
as	OO
extraordinary	OO
or	OO
fascinating	OO
as	OO
this	,O
and	OO
that's	OO
what	OO
we're	OO
going	OO
to	OO
show	OO
you	OO
tonight	.O
alright	,U
so	OO
for	OO
those	OO
of	OO
you	OO
who	OO
might	OO
be	OO
a	OO
little	OO
squeamish	,O
the	OO
next	OO
10	OO
minutes	OO
or	OO
so	OO
will	OO
get	OO
incrementally	OO
more	OO
graphic	OO
and	OO
stomach	OO
churning	,O
so	OO
let's	OO
get	OO
into	OO
it	OO
—	OO
tt:	OU
feel	OU
free	OO
to	OO
use	OO
the	OO
bucket	.O
mb:	OU
so	OU
when	OO
we	OO
make	OO
sound	,O
we	OO
use	OO
the	OO
vocal	OO
cords	OO
to	OO
take	OO
air	OO
from	OO
the	OO
lungs	OO
and	OO
then	OO
turn	OO
it	OO
into	OO
a	OO
vibrating	OO
air	OO
column	OO
in	OO
the	OO
throat	.O
if	OU
you	OO
think	OO
of	OO
it	OO
like	OO
a	OO
trumpet	,O
we've	OO
got	OO
the	OO
mouthpiece	OO
—	OO
that's	OO
the	OO
vocal	OO
folds	OO
—	OO
and	OO
then	OO
the	OO
horn	OO
section	OO
is	OO
the	OO
throat	.O
if	OU
we	OO
took	OO
your	OO
head	OO
off	,O
took	OO
a	OO
bit	OO
of	OO
your	OO
neck	OO
off	OO
and	OO
left	OO
you	OO
as	OO
a	OO
torso	OO
with	OO
just	OO
your	OO
vocal	OO
folds	OO
vibrating	,O
this	OO
is	OO
what	OO
you'd	OO
sound	OO
like	.O
tt:	OU
mb:	OU
pretty	OU
hard	OO
to	OO
communicate	,O
but	OO
fortunately	OO
we've	OO
got	OO
a	OO
throat	.O
we've	OU
got	OO
all	OO
the	OO
soft	OO
tissues	,O
and	OO
that	OO
actually	OO
gives	OO
you	OO
all	OO
the	OO
incredible	OO
dynamics	OO
of	OO
sound	OO
that	OO
you'll	OO
hear	OO
tonight	.O
now	,U
this	OO
is	OO
a	OO
rigid	OO
laryngoscope	.O
tt:	OU
hmm	,U
spicy	OO
boy	.O
mb:	OU
i	OU
know	,O
i	OU
know	.O
10	OO
millimeters	OO
in	OO
diameter	,O
it	OO
gives	OO
us	OO
the	OO
highest	OO
resolution	OO
image	OO
of	OO
the	OO
larynx	OO
we	OO
can	OO
get	.O
and	OU
we	OO
teed	OO
up	OO
with	OO
a	OO
stroboscope	OO
here	OO
and	OO
a	OO
trigger	OO
microphone	.O
the	OU
mic	OO
will	OO
pick	OO
up	OO
the	OO
frequency	OO
and	OO
that	OO
will	OO
allow	OO
us	OO
to	OO
show	OO
you	OO
how	OO
this	OO
all	OO
works	.O
so	,U
if	OO
we	OO
can	OO
have	OO
the	OO
lights	OO
down	?O
tt:	OU
mb:	OU
turn	OU
the	OO
light	OO
on	OO
here	.O
tt:	OU
mb:	OU
so	OU
i've	OU
got	OO
the	OO
frequency	OO
of	OO
sound	OO
matched	OO
with	OO
the	OO
stroboscope	.O
that's	OU
the	OO
light	OO
you're	OO
seeing	OO
flickering	OO
in	OO
the	OO
cup	.O
tt:	OU
mb:	OU
and	OU
that's	OO
at	OO
about	OO
80	OO
hertz	OO
or	OO
so	.O
so	OU
what	OO
we	OO
can	OO
do	OO
then	OO
is	OO
we	OO
can	OO
take	OO
that	OO
and	OO
put	OO
the	OO
phase	OO
of	OO
the	OO
strobe	OO
and	OO
the	OO
sound	OO
just	OO
out	OO
of	OO
sync	.O
that	OU
lets	OO
us	OO
capture	OO
real	OO
time	,O
slow	OO
motion	OO
activity	OO
of	OO
vibrating	OO
tissues	.O
when	OU
we	OO
apply	OO
that	OO
to	OO
the	OO
larynx	,O
we	OO
get	OO
this	OO
fluid	,O
slow	OO
motion	OO
of	OO
the	OO
vibrating	OO
vocal	OO
folds	.O
so	OU
that's	OO
what	OO
we're	OO
going	OO
to	OO
get	OO
on	OO
and	OO
do	.O
alright	,U
you	OO
ready	?O
tt:	OU
yup	.U
mb:	OU
ok	,U
so	OO
here	OO
we	OO
go	.O
we're	OU
going	OO
to	OO
have	OO
a	OO
look	OO
at	OO
the	OO
voice	OO
box	.O
it's	OU
very	OO
hard	OO
not	OO
to	OO
gag	OO
with	OO
this	.O
say	,U
e	.O
tt:	OU
e	OU
—	OO
mb:	OU
so	OU
down	OO
the	OO
bottom	OO
you	OO
see	OO
the	OO
vocal	OO
cords	,O
the	OO
little	OO
cord	OO
like	OO
structures	.O
and	OU
now	OO
just	OO
look	OO
at	OO
the	OO
skin	OO
on	OO
the	OO
neck	OO
and	OO
you'll	OO
see	OO
how	OO
strong	OO
the	OO
light	OO
is	OO
to	OO
penetrate	OO
the	OO
skin	.O
alright	,U
so	OO
if	OO
you'll	OO
have	OO
the	OO
lights	OO
back	OO
on	?O
alright	,U
so	OO
just	OO
give	OO
us	OO
a	OO
comfortable	OO
e	.O
tt:	OU
e	.U
tt:	OU
e	.U
mb:	OU
so	OU
that's	OO
the	OO
vibrating	OO
vocal	OO
folds;	OO
about	OO
120	OO
hertz	.O
means	OU
they've	OO
collided	OO
120	OO
times	OO
a	OO
second	OO
just	OO
to	OO
make	OO
that	OO
sound	.O
and	OU
we	OO
can	OO
also	OO
see	OO
that	OO
they're	OO
absolutely	,O
perfectly	OO
normal	.O
so	OU
all	OO
his	OO
beatboxing	,O
all	OO
those	OO
sounds	OO
for	OO
years	OO
with	OO
tom's	OU
way	OO
of	OO
doing	OO
it	OO
—	OO
absolutely	OO
no	OO
damage	OO
whatsoever	.O
that's	OU
really	OO
remarkable	.O
well	OU
done	.O
ok	.U
tt:	OU
we've	OU
got	OO
this	.O
mb:	OU
so	OU
watch	OO
now	OO
as	OO
the	OO
vocal	OO
cords	OO
go	OO
from	OO
high	OO
pitch	OO
to	OO
low	OO
pitch	.O
you'll	OU
see	OO
them	OO
go	OO
from	OO
long	OO
and	OO
skinny	OO
to	OO
short	OO
and	OO
fat	.O
really	OU
think	OO
e	.O
tt:	OU
e	.U
mb:	OU
right	.U
tt:	OU
e	.U
mb:	OU
and	OU
what	OO
you	OO
can	OO
see	OO
is	OO
that	OO
his	OO
vocal	OO
range	OO
is	OO
so	OO
extreme	OO
—	OO
much	OO
more	OO
extreme	OO
than	OO
any	OO
other	OO
performer	OO
i've	OU
worked	OO
with	OO
—	OO
the	OO
machine	OO
actually	OO
can't	OO
capture	OO
the	OO
really	OO
high	OO
pitches	.O
tt:	OU
mb:	OU
so	OU
we	OO
know	OO
that	OO
whistle	OO
register	OO
is	OO
somewhere	OO
around	OO
2,092	OO
hertz	.O
that	OU
means	OO
the	OO
vocal	OO
cords	,O
well	OO
over	OO
2,000	OO
times	OO
a	OO
second	,O
are	OO
banging	OO
together	OO
just	OO
to	OO
make	OO
that	OO
sound	.O
that's	OU
really	OO
extraordinary	.O
if	OU
you	OO
think	OO
about	OO
them	,O
they're	OO
only	OO
15	OO
millimeters	OO
long	,O
so	OO
that's	OO
barely	OO
the	OO
width	OO
of	OO
your	OO
thumb	.O
that's	OU
incred	OO
—	OO
that's	OU
amazing	OO
this	OO
organ	OO
can	OO
do	OO
such	OO
a	OO
thing	.O
so	OU
now	OO
we're	OO
going	OO
to	OO
swap	OO
over	OO
to	OO
the	OO
flexible	OO
laryngoscope	.O
this	OU
is	OO
a	OO
little	OO
more	OO
graphic	.O
tt:	OU
he	OU
bought	OO
it	OO
at	OO
sexpo	.U
mb:	OU
that	OU
wasn't	OO
in	OO
the	OO
script	.O
tt:	OU
secondhand	.U
mb:	OU
now	,U
we've	OO
had	OO
to	OO
time	OO
this	OO
bit	OO
perfectly	OO
because	OO
of	OO
the	OO
requirement	OO
for	OO
local	OO
anesthetic	.O
you've	OU
got	OO
to	OO
numb	OO
the	OO
nose	,O
get	OO
the	OO
camera	OO
in	.O
it	OU
doesn't	OO
help	OO
for	OO
producing	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
the	OO
sounds	,O
but	OO
it	OO
gives	OO
us	OO
a	OO
really	OO
cool	OO
view	OO
of	OO
what's	OO
happening	.O
so	OU
hold	OO
onto	OO
the	OO
stomachs	,O
and	OO
let's	OO
see	OO
what	OO
we	OO
can	OO
do	.O
so	OU
we're	OO
going	OO
to	OO
the	OO
back	OO
of	OO
the	OO
nose	.O
and	OU
there	OO
you	OO
can	OO
see	OO
the	OO
soft	OO
palate	.O
a	OU
lot	OO
of	OO
the	OO
sounds	OO
we	OO
make	OO
from	OO
day	OO
to	OO
day	,O
even	OO
the	OO
simple	OO
ones	,O
are	OO
incredibly	OO
complex	.O
the	OU
sound	OO
kh	OO
for	OO
example	.O
it's	OU
the	OO
soft	OO
palate	OO
sealing	OO
up	OO
precisely	OO
against	OO
the	OO
back	OO
of	OO
the	OO
nose	.O
so	OU
if	OO
you	OO
say	OO
it	OO
loudly	OO
five	OO
times	,O
feel	OO
your	OO
own	OO
soft	OO
palate	OO
snapping	OO
against	OO
the	OO
back	OO
of	OO
the	OO
throat	.O
kh	,U
kh	,O
kh	,O
kh	,O
kh	,O
kh	.O
alright	,U
so	OO
this	OO
is	OO
what	OO
it	OO
looks	OO
like	OO
when	OO
tom	OU
does	OO
it	.O
tt:	OU
kh	,U
kh	,O
kh	,O
kh	,O
kh	.O
a	OU
cacophony	OO
of	OO
cackling	OO
kookaburras	OO
and	OO
cockatoos	OO
in	OO
kakadu	OU
couldn't	OO
quite	OO
quit	OO
ketamine	.O
mb:	OU
alright	,U
now	OO
in	OO
the	OO
beatboxing	OO
world	,O
of	OO
course	,O
they	OO
can	OO
use	OO
that	OO
for	OO
all	OO
sorts	OO
of	OO
different	OO
effects	.O
i	OU
can	OO
help	OO
you	.O
tt:	OU
this	OU
is	OO
fine	,O
we're	OO
professionals	.O
mb:	OU
alright	.U
now	OU
we're	OO
going	OO
to	OO
slide	OO
down	OO
a	OO
little	OO
further	.O
if	OU
you'll	OO
just	OO
have	OO
the	OO
lights	OO
off	OO
and	OO
just	OO
see	OO
if	OO
you	OO
can	OO
see	OO
the	OO
light	OO
in	OO
the	OO
mouth	OO
somewhere	.O
you'll	OU
be	OO
able	OO
to	OO
see	OO
exactly	OO
where	OO
the	OO
camera	OO
is	OO
at	.O
tt:	OU
surprise	.U
mb:	OU
alright	.U
so	OU
what	OO
you	OO
can	OO
see	OO
there	,O
that's	OO
the	OO
base	OO
of	OO
the	OO
tongue	.O
the	OU
side	OO
walls	OO
of	OO
the	OO
screen	,O
that's	OO
the	OO
pharynx	.O
all	OU
muscle	OO
walls	,O
and	OO
in	OO
the	OO
deep	,O
dark	OO
decks	OO
is	OO
the	OO
larynx	.O
tt:	OU
oh	,U
should	OO
we	OO
have	OO
the	OO
lights	OO
back	OO
on	?O
i	OU
think	OO
it's	OO
a	OO
good	OO
idea	.O
it's	OU
getting	OO
a	OO
bit	OO
creepy	OO
with	OO
them	OO
off	.O
mb:	OU
turn	OU
the	OO
lights	OO
on	,O
thanks	.O
good	.U
now	OU
having	OO
examined	OO
over	OO
15,000	OO
larynxes	OO
and	OO
throats	OO
in	OO
my	OO
time	,O
i	OU
can	OO
tell	OO
you	OO
that	OO
tom's	OU
is	OO
as	OO
anatomically	OO
normal	OO
as	OO
anyone	OO
else's	.O
it's	OU
just	OO
his	OO
unique	OO
use	OO
of	OO
all	OO
the	OO
muscles	OO
and	OO
soft	OO
tissues	OO
which	OO
lets	OO
him	OO
do	OO
all	OO
these	OO
amazing	OO
sounds	OO
that	OO
you're	OO
going	OO
to	OO
hear	.O
so	OU
we	OO
will	OO
dissect	OO
some	OO
of	OO
these	OO
sounds	OO
for	OO
you	OO
now	.O
tt:	OU
it's	OU
in	OO
there	OO
really	.O
definitely	.U
ok	.U
mb:	OU
so	OU
what	OO
he's	OO
doing	OO
is	OO
he's	OO
changing	OO
the	OO
shape	OO
and	OO
the	OO
length	OO
of	OO
the	OO
vibrating	OO
air	OO
column	OO
using	OO
rhythmic	OO
contractions	OO
of	OO
all	OO
the	OO
muscles	OO
to	OO
generate	OO
all	OO
those	OO
sounds	OO
that	OO
you're	OO
hearing	.O
mb:	OU
and	OU
now	OO
there's	OO
rhythmic	OO
movements	OO
of	OO
the	OO
—	OO
they're	OO
the	OO
arytenoid	OO
cartilages	OO
way	OO
down	OO
there	,O
rocking	OO
back	OO
and	OO
forth	OO
to	OO
create	OO
that	OO
different	OO
sound	.O
tt:	OU
mb:	OU
and	OU
we	OO
like	OO
to	OO
call	OO
this	OO
sphincter	OO
bass	.O
and	OU
what	OO
you	OO
can	OO
see	OO
is	OO
that	OO
collapsing	OO
all	OO
the	OO
tissue	OO
down	OO
—	OO
allows	OO
a	OO
different	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
really	OO
deep	OO
bass	OO
note	.O
alright	,U
so	OO
with	OO
local	OO
anesthetic	OO
on	OO
board	,O
a	OO
big	OO
black	OO
hose	OO
in	OO
the	OO
nose	,O
we're	OO
going	OO
to	OO
let	OO
loose	OO
a	OO
sliver	OO
of	OO
his	OO
repertoire	OO
and	OO
see	OO
all	OO
this	OO
in	OO
play	.O
and	OU
we'll	OO
move	OO
—	OO
careful	.O
tt:	OU
can	OU
you	OO
pull	OO
it	OO
up	OO
just	OO
a	OO
smidgeon	.O
tt:	OU
maybe	OU
just	OO
a	OO
little	OO
more	OO
—	OO
alright	,U
cool	,O
i	OU
think	OO
we're	OO
good	.O
to	OU
all	OO
my	OO
peeps	OO
who	OO
came	OO
to	OO
get	OO
deep	,O
deep	OO
as	OO
the	OO
abyss	OO
—	OO
check	OO
this	.O
we	OU
start	OO
from	OO
the	OO
basics	OO
and	OO
build	OO
from	OO
scratch	.O
yeah	,U
like	OO
that	.O
back	OU
to	OO
basics	.O
you	OU
know	OO
the	OO
sound	.O
make	OU
some	OO
noise	.O
tt:	OU
thank	OU
you	OO
so	OO
much	.O
by	OU
1973	,O

that	OO

essential	OO
to	OO
the	OO

that	OO

from	OU

refused	OO

was	OO
sure	OO
that	OO

from	OO

he	OO
saw	OO
the	OO

as	OO
one	OO
of	OO
many	OO

without	OO

in	OO

a	OO

the	OO
extreme	OO
conditions	OO
during	OO

with	OO

i	OU
can	OO
collide	OO

to	OO
make	OO
them	OO

or	OO
i	OU
can	OO

them	.O
i	OU
want	OO
to	OO
understand	OO
how	OO
to	OO
make	OO
the	OO
earth	OU
and	OO
the	OO
moon	OU
and	OO
why	OO
the	OO
earth	OU
is	OO
so	OO
different	OO
from	OO
other	OO
planets	.O
the	OU
leading	OO
idea	OO
for	OO
the	OO
origin	OO
of	OO
the	OO
earth	OU
and	OO

is	OO
called	OO
the	OO
giant	OO
impact	OO
theory	.O
the	OU
theory	OO
states	OO
that	OO
a	OO
mars	OU
sized	OO
body	OO
struck	OO
the	OO
young	OO
earth	,U
and	OO
the	OO
moon	OU
formed	OO
from	OO
the	OO
debris	OO
disk	OO
around	OO
the	OO
planet	.O
the	OU
theory	OO
can	OO
explain	OO
so	OO
many	OO
things	OO
about	OO
the	OO
moon	,U
but	OO
it	OO
has	OO
a	OO
huge	OO
flaw:	OO
it	OO
predicts	OO
that	OO
the	OO
moon	OU
is	OO
mostly	OO
made	OO
from	OO
the	OO
mars	OU
sized	OO
planet	,O
that	OO
the	OO
earth	OU
and	OO
the	OO
moon	OU
are	OO
made	OO
from	OO
different	OO
materials	.O
but	OU
that's	OO
not	OO
what	OO
we	OO
see	.O
the	OU
earth	OU
and	OO
the	OO
moon	OU
are	OO
actually	OO
like	OO
identical	OO
twins	.O
the	OU
genetic	OO
code	OO
of	OO
planets	OO
is	OO
written	OO
in	OO
the	OO

it's	OU

all	OU

when	OU

started	OO
working	OO
on	OO
the	OO
origin	OO
of	OO
the	OO

there	OO
were	OO
scientists	OO
that	OO

to	OO
reject	OO
the	OO
whole	OO

of	OO
the	OO

they	OU
didn't	OO
see	OO
any	OO
way	OO
for	OO
this	OO

to	OO
explain	OO
the	OO
special	OO
relationship	OO
between	OO
the	OO
earth	OU

the	OO

we	OU
were	OO
all	OO
trying	OO
to	OO
think	OO

new	OO
ideas	.O
the	OU
problem	OO
was	,O
there	OO
weren't	OO
any	OO
better	OO
ideas	.O
all	OU
of	OO
the	OO

had	OO
even	OO

so	OU
we	OO
were	OO
trying	OO
to	OO
rescue	OO
the	OO
giant	OO
impact	OO
theory	.O
a	OU
young	OO
scientist	OO
in	OO
my	OO
group	OO
suggested	OO
that	OO
we	OO
try	OO
changing	OO
the	OO
spin	OO
of	OO
the	OO
giant	OO
impact	.O
maybe	OU
making	OO
the	OO
earth	OU
spin	OO
faster	OO
could	OO
mix	OO
more	OO
material	OO
and	OO
explain	OO
the	OO
moon	.U
the	OU
mars	OU
sized	OO
impactor	OO
had	OO
been	OO
chosen	OO
because	OO
it	OO
could	OO
make	OO
the	OO
moon	OU
and	OO
make	OO
the	OO
length	OO
of	OO
earth's	OU
day	.O
people	OU
really	OO
liked	OO
that	OO
part	OO
of	OO
the	OO
model	.O
but	OU
what	OO
if	OO
something	OO
else	OO
determined	OO
the	OO
length	OO
of	OO
earth's	OU
day	?O
then	OU
there	OO
would	OO
be	OO
many	OO
more	OO
possible	OO
giant	OO
impacts	OO
that	OO
could	OO
make	OO
the	OO
moon	.U
i	OU
was	OO
curious	OO
about	OO
what	OO
could	OO
happen	,O
so	OO
i	OU
tried	OO
simulating	OO
faster	OO

and	OO
i	OU
found	OO
that	OO
it	OO
is	OO
possible	OO
to	OO
make	OO
a	OO
disk	OO
out	OO
of	OO
the	OO
same	OO
mixture	OO
of	OO
materials	OO
as	OO
the	OO

we	OU
were	OO
pretty	OO
excited	.O
maybe	OU
this	OO
was	OO
the	OO
way	OO
to	OO
explain	OO
the	OO
moon	.U
the	OU
problem	OO
is	,O
we	OO
also	OO
found	OO
that	OO
that's	OO
just	OO
not	OO
very	OO
likely	.O
most	OU
of	OO
the	OO
time	,O
the	OO
disk	OO
is	OO
different	OO
from	OO
the	OO

and	OO
it	OO
looked	OO
like	OO
making	OO
our	OO
moon	OU
this	OO
way	OO
would	OO
be	OO
an	OO
astronomical	OO
coincidence	,O
and	OO
it	OO
was	OO
just	OO
hard	OO
for	OO
everyone	OO
to	OO
accept	OO
the	OO
idea	OO
that	OO
the	OO
moon's	OU

an	OO

the	OU

the	OO

at	OO

on	OU
that	OO

we	OO

the	OU

it	OU

the	OU

in	OU

it	OO

of	OO
people	OO
don't	OO
know	OO
this	,O
that's	OO
why	,O
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
times	,O
people	OO
sweep	OO
anxiety	OO
under	OO
the	OO
rug	OO
as	OO
just	OO
nerves	OO
that	OO
you	OO
need	OO
to	OO
get	OO
over	,O
as	OO
a	OO
weakness	,O
but	OO
anxiety	OO
is	OO
so	OO
much	OO
more	OO
than	OO
that	.O
a	OU
reason	OO
why	OO
so	OO
many	OO
people	OO
don't	OO
think	OO
it's	OO
important	OO
is	OO
that	OO
they	OO
don't	OO
know	OO
what	OO
it	OO
is	.O
is	OU
it	OO
your	OO
personality	?O
is	OU
it	OO
an	OO
illness	?O
is	OU
it	OO
a	OO
normal	OO
sensation	?O
what	OU
is	?O
that's	OU
why	OO
it's	OO
important	OO
to	OO
differentiate	OO
what	OO
is	OO
normal	OO
anxiety	OO
from	OO
what	OO
is	OO
an	OO
anxiety	OO
disorder	.O
normal	OU
anxiety	OO
is	OO
an	OO
emotion	OO
that	OO
we	OO
all	OO
get	OO
when	OO
we're	OO
in	OO
stressful	OO
situations	.O
for	OU
example	,O
let's	OO
say	,O
you're	OO
out	OO
in	OO
the	OO
woods	,O
and	OO
you	OO
come	OO
face	OO
to	OO
face	OO
with	OO
a	OO
bear	.O
this	OU
will	OO
probably	OO
make	OO
you	OO
feel	OO
a	OO
little	OO
bit	OO
anxious	,O
and	OO
you'll	OO
probably	OO
want	OO
to	OO
start	OO
running	OO
like	OO
crazy	.O
this	OU
anxious	OO
feeling	OO
that	OO
you	OO
get	OO
is	OO
good	OO
because	OO
it	OO
protects	OO
you	,O
it	OO
saves	OO
you	,O
and	OO
it	OO
makes	OO
you	OO
on	OO
a	OO
hightail	OO
it	OO
out	OO
of	OO
there	,O
although	OO
maybe	OO
it's	OO
not	OO
such	OO
a	OO
good	OO
idea	OO
to	OO
start	OO
running	OO
when	OO
you	OO
see	OO
a	OO
bear	.O
i	OU
really	OO
don't	OO
think	OO
you	OO
can	OO
outrun	OO
a	OO
bear	.O
anxiety	OU
helps	OO
us	OO
meet	OO
our	OO
deadlines	OO
at	OO
work	OO
and	OO
deal	OO
with	OO
emergencies	OO
in	OO
life	,O
but	OO
when	OO
this	OO
anxiety	OO
emotion	OO
is	OO
taken	OO
to	OO
the	OO
extreme	OO
and	OO
arises	OO
in	OO
situations	OO
which	OO
don't	OO
pose	OO
a	OO
real	OO
threat	,O
then	OO
that's	OO
when	OO
you	OO
might	OO
have	OO
an	OO
anxiety	OO
disorder	.O
for	OU
example	,O
people	OO
with	OO
generalized	OO
anxiety	OO
disorder	OO
worry	OO
excessively	OO
and	OO
constantly	OO
about	OO
everything	OO
going	OO
on	OO
in	OO
their	OO
lives	,O
and	OO
they	OO
find	OO
it	OO
very	OO
difficult	OO
to	OO
control	OO
this	OO
worry	.O
they	OU
also	OO
have	OO
symptoms	OO
like	OO
restlessness	,O
fear	,O
they	OO
find	OO
it	OO
hard	OO
to	OO
fall	OO
asleep	OO
at	OO
night	,O
and	OO
they	OO
can't	OO
concentrate	OO
on	OO
tasks	.O
in	OU
spite	OO
of	OO
whatever	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
anxiety	OO
you	OO
might	OO
be	OO
suffering	OO
from	,O
there	OO
is	OO
something	OO
that	OO
you	OO
can	OO
do	OO
to	OO
lower	OO
it	.O
it	OU
works	,O
and	OO
it's	OO
simpler	OO
than	OO
you	OO
may	OO
think	.O
all	OU
too	OO
often	,O
we're	OO
given	OO
medication	OO
for	OO
mental	OO
disorders	,O
but	OO
it	OO
doesn't	OO
always	OO
work	OO
in	OO
the	OO
long	OO
run	.O
symptoms	OU
often	OO
come	OO
back	,O
and	OO
you're	OO
back	OO
to	OO
where	OO
you	OO
started	.O
so	OU
here's	OO
something	OO
else	OO
to	OO
consider:	OO
the	OO
way	OO
you	OO
cope	OO
or	OO
handle	OO
things	OO
has	OO
a	OO
direct	OO
impact	OO
on	OO
how	OO
much	OO
anxiety	OO
you're	OO
experiencing	,O
and	OO
if	OO
you	OO
tweak	OO
the	OO
way	OO
you're	OO
coping	,O
then	OO
you	OO
can	OO
lower	OO
your	OO
anxiety	.O
in	OU
our	OO
study	OO
at	OO
the	OO
university	OU
of	OO
cambridge	,U
we	OO
showed	OO
that	OO
women	OO
living	OO
in	OO
poor	OO
areas	OO
have	OO
a	OO
higher	OO
risk	OO
for	OO
anxiety	OO
than	OO
women	OO
living	OO
in	OO
richer	OO
areas	.O
these	OU
results	OO
didn't	OO
surprise	OO
us	,O
but	OO
when	OO
we	OO
looked	OO
closer	,O
we	OO
found	OO
that	OO
women	OO
living	OO
in	OO
poor	OO
areas	,O
if	OO
they	OO
had	OO
a	OO
particular	OO
set	OO
of	OO
coping	OO
resources	,O
they	OO
didn't	OO
have	OO
anxiety	,O
while	OO
women	OO
living	OO
in	OO
poor	OO
areas	OO
without	OO
these	OO
coping	OO
resources	OO
had	OO
anxiety	.O
other	OU
studies	OO
showed	OO
that	OO
people	OO
who	OO
had	OO
faced	OO
extreme	OO
circumstances	,O
who	OO
had	OO
faced	OO
adversity	,O
been	OO
through	OO
wars	OO
and	OO
natural	OO
disasters	,O
if	OO
they	OO
had	OO
coping	OO
resources	,O
they	OO
remained	OO
healthy	OO
and	OO
free	OO
of	OO
mental	OO
disorders	,O
while	OO
others	,O
facing	OO
the	OO
same	OO
hardships	OO
but	OO
without	OO
coping	OO
skills	OO
went	OO
on	OO
a	OO
downward	OO
spiral	OO
and	OO
developed	OO
mental	OO
disorders	.O
so	OU
what	OO
are	OO
some	OO
of	OO
these	OO
coping	OO
resources	,O
and	OO
how	OO
can	OO
we	OO
use	OO
them	OO
to	OO
lower	OO
our	OO
anxiety	?O
and	OU
before	OO
i	OU
dive	OO
into	OO
what	OO
they	OO
are	,O
i'd	OU
like	OO
to	OO
point	OO
out	OO
and	OO
i	OU
think	OO
this	OO
is	OO
so	OO
interesting	OO
you	OO
can	OO
develop	OO
these	OO
coping	OO
resources	OO
or	OO
coping	OO
skills	OO
on	OO
your	OO
own	OO
through	OO
the	OO
things	OO
that	OO
you	OO
do;	OO
you	OO
can	OO
take	OO
charge	OO
of	OO
your	OO
anxiety	OO
and	OO
lower	OO
it	,O
which	OO
i	OU
think	OO
is	OO
so	OO
empowering	.O
today	OU
i'll	OU
be	OO
talking	OO
about	OO
three	OO
coping	OO
resources	,O
and	OO
the	OO
first	OO
one	OO
is	OO
feeling	OO
like	OO
you're	OO
in	OO
control	OO
of	OO
your	OO
life	.O
people	OU
who	OO
feel	OO
like	OO
they're	OO
more	OO
in	OO
control	OO
of	OO
their	OO
life	OO
have	OO
better	OO
mental	OO
health	.O
if	OU
you	OO
feel	OO
like	OO
you're	OO
lacking	OO
in	OO
control	OO
in	OO
life	,O
then	OO
research	OO
shows	OO
that	OO
you	OO
should	OO
engage	OO
in	OO
experiences	OO
that	OO
give	OO
you	OO
greater	OO
control	.O
i'll	OU
show	OO
you	OO
what	OO
i	OU
mean:	OO
do	OO
you	OO
sometimes	OO
find	OO
that	OO
you	OO
put	OO
off	OO
starting	OO
something	OO
because	OO
you	OO
just	OO
don't	OO
feel	OO
ready	OO
enough	?O
do	OU
you	OO
find	OO
it	OO
hard	OO
to	OO
make	OO
decisions	OO
like	OO
what	OO
to	OO
wear	,O
what	OO
to	OO
eat	OO
who	OO
to	OO
date	,O
which	OO
job	OO
to	OO
take	OO
up	?O
do	OU
you	OO
tend	OO
to	OO
waste	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
time	OO
deciding	OO
what	OO
you	OO
might	OO
do	OO
while	OO
nothing	OO
gets	OO
done	?O
a	OU
way	OO
to	OO
overcome	OO
indecision	OO
and	OO
this	OO
lack	OO
of	OO
control	OO
in	OO
life	,O
is	OO
to	OO
do	OO
it	OO
badly	.O
there's	OU
a	OO
quote	OO
by	OO
writer	OO
and	OO
poet	OO
gk	OU
chesterton	OU
that	OO
says	,O
anything	OU
worth	OO
doing	OO
is	OO
worth	OO
doing	OO
badly	OO
the	OO
first	OO
time	.O
the	OU
reason	OO
why	OO
this	OO
works	OO
so	OO
well	OO
is	OO
that	OO
it	OO
speeds	OO
up	OO
your	OO
decision	OO
making	OO
and	OO
catapults	OO
you	OO
straight	OO
into	OO
action	,O
otherwise	,O
you	OO
can	OO
spend	OO
hours	OO
deciding	OO
how	OO
you	OO
should	OO
go	OO
about	OO
doing	OO
something	OO
or	OO
what	OO
you	OO
should	OO
do	.O
this	OU
can	OO
be	OO
paralyzing	OO
and	OO
can	OO
make	OO
you	OO
afraid	OO
to	OO
even	OO
begin	.O
all	OU
too	OO
often	,O
we	OO
aim	OO
for	OO
perfection	,O
but	OO
never	OO
end	OO
up	OO
doing	OO
anything	OO
because	OO
the	OO
standards	OO
that	OO
we	OO
set	OO
for	OO
ourselves	OO
are	OO
too	OO
high	,O
they're	OO
intimidating	,O
which	OO
stresses	OO
us	OO
out	OO
so	OO
we	OO
delay	OO
starting	OO
something	,O
or	OO
we	OO
might	OO
even	OO
abandon	OO
the	OO
whole	OO
thing	OO
altogether	.O
do	OU
it	OO
badly	OO
frees	OO
you	OO
up	OO
to	OO
take	OO
action	.O
i	OU
mean	OO
you	OO
know	OO
how	OO
it	OO
is:	OO
so	OO
often	,O
we	OO
want	OO
to	OO
do	OO
something	OO
perfectly	OO
we	OO
can't	OO
start	OO
until	OO
it's	OO
the	OO
perfect	OO
time	,O
until	OO
we've	OO
got	OO
all	OO
the	OO
skills	,O
but	OO
this	OO
can	OO
be	OO
daunting	OO
and	OO
stressful	OO
so	OO
why	OO
not	OO
just	OO
jump	OO
into	OO
it	OO
just	OO
do	OO
it	OO
however	,O
without	OO
worrying	OO
if	OO
it's	OO
good	OO
or	OO
bad	?O
this	OU
will	OO
make	OO
it	OO
that	OO
much	OO
easier	OO
to	OO
start	OO
something	OO
and	OO
as	OO
you're	OO
doing	OO
it	OO
badly	OO
to	OO
finish	OO
it	,O
and	OO
when	OO
you	OO
look	OO
back	,O
you'll	OO
realize	,O
more	OO
often	OO
than	OO
not	,O
that	OO
actually	OO
it's	OO
not	OO
that	OO
bad	.O
a	OU
close	OO
friend	OO
of	OO
mine	OO
who	OO
has	OO
anxiety	OO
started	OO
using	OO
this	OO
motto	,O
and	OO
this	OO
is	OO
what	OO
she	OO
said	,O
when	OU
i	OU
started	OO
using	OO
this	OO
motto	,O
my	OO
life	OO
transformed	.O
i	OU
found	OO
i	OU
could	OO
complete	OO
tasks	OO
in	OO
much	OO
shorter	OO
time	OO
periods	OO
than	OO
before	.O
do	OU
it	OO
badly	OO
gave	OO
me	OO
wings	OO
to	OO
take	OO
risks	,O
to	OO
try	OO
something	OO
differently	,O
and	OO
to	OO
have	OO
way	OO
more	OO
fun	OO
during	OO
the	OO
whole	OO
process	.O
it	OU
took	OO
the	OO
anxiety	OO
out	OO
of	OO
everything	OO
and	OO
replaced	OO
it	OO
with	OO
excitement	.O
so	OU
do	OO
it	OO
badly	,O
and	OO
you	OO
can	OO
improve	OO
as	OO
you	OO
go	OO
along	.O
i'd	OU
like	OO
to	OO
ask	OO
you	OO
to	OO
think	OO
about	OO
this:	OO
if	OO
you	OO
start	OO
using	OO
this	OO
motto	OO
today	,O
how	OO
would	OO
your	OO
life	OO
change	?O
the	OU
second	OO
coping	OO
strategy	OO
is	OO
to	OO
forgive	OO
yourself	,O
and	OO
this	OO
is	OO
very	OO
powerful	OO
if	OO
you	OO
use	OO
it	.O
people	OU
with	OO
anxiety	OO
think	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
about	OO
what	OO
they're	OO
doing	OO
wrong	,O
their	OO
worries	,O
and	OO
how	OO
bad	OO
they're	OO
feeling	.O
imagine	OU
if	OO
you	OO
had	OO
a	OO
friend	OO
who	OO
constantly	OO
pointed	OO
out	OO
everything	OO
you're	OO
doing	OO
wrong	,O
and	OO
everything	OO
that	OO
was	OO
wrong	OO
with	OO
your	OO
life	.O
you	OU
would	OO
probably	OO
want	OO
to	OO
get	OO
rid	OO
of	OO
this	OO
person	OO
right	OO
away	,O
wouldn't	OO
you	?O
well	,U
people	OO
with	OO
anxiety	OO
do	OO
this	OO
to	OO
themselves	OO
all	OO
day	OO
long	.O
they're	OU
not	OO
kind	OO
to	OO
themselves	.O
so	OU
maybe	OO
it's	OO
time	OO
to	OO
start	OO
being	OO
kinder	OO
with	OO
ourselves	,O
time	OO
to	OO
start	OO
supporting	OO
ourselves	,O
and	OO
a	OO
way	OO
to	OO
do	OO
this	OO
is	OO
to	OO
forgive	OO
yourself	OO
for	OO
any	OO
mistakes	OO
you	OO
think	OO
you	OO
might	OO
have	OO
made	OO
just	OO
a	OO
few	OO
moments	OO
ago	OO
to	OO
mistakes	OO
made	OO
in	OO
the	OO
past	.O
if	OU
you	OO
had	OO
a	OO
panic	OO
attack	OO
and	OO
are	OO
embarrassed	OO
about	OO
it	,O
forgive	OO
yourself;	OO
if	OO
you	OO
wanted	OO
to	OO
talk	OO
to	OO
someone	,O
but	OO
couldn't	OO
muster	OO
up	OO
the	OO
courage	OO
to	OO
do	OO
so	,O
don't	OO
worry	OO
about	OO
it	,O
let	OO
it	OO
go;	OO
forgive	OO
yourself	OO
for	OO
anything	OO
and	OO
everything	OO
and	OO
this	OO
will	OO
give	OO
you	OO
greater	OO
compassion	OO
towards	OO
yourself	.O
you	OU
can't	OO
begin	OO
to	OO
heal	OO
until	OO
you	OO
do	OO
this	.O
and	OU
last	OO
but	OO
not	OO
least	,O
having	OO
a	OO
purpose	OO
and	OO
meaning	OO
in	OO
life	OO
is	OO
a	OO
very	OO
important	OO
coping	OO
mechanism	.O
whatever	OU
we	OO
do	OO
in	OO
life	,O
whatever	OO
work	OO
we	OO
produce	,O
however	OO
much	OO
money	OO
we	OO
make	,O
we	OO
cannot	OO
be	OO
fully	OO
happy	OO
until	OO
we	OO
know	OO
that	OO
someone	OO
else	OO
needs	OO
us	,O
that	OO
someone	OO
else	OO
depends	OO
on	OO
our	OO
accomplishments	,O
or	OO
on	OO
the	OO
love	OO
that	OO
we	OO
have	OO
to	OO
share	.O
it's	OU
not	OO
that	OO
we	OO
need	OO
other	OO
people's	OO
good	OO
words	OO
to	OO
keep	OO
going	OO
in	OO
life	,O
but	OO
if	OO
we	OO
don't	OO
do	OO
something	OO
with	OO
someone	OO
else	OO
in	OO
mind	,O
then	OO
we're	OO
at	OO
much	OO
higher	OO
risk	OO
for	OO
poor	OO
mental	OO
health	.O
the	OU
famous	OO
neurologist	OO
dr	.U
victor	OU
frankel	OU
said	,O
for	OU
people	OO
who	OO
think	OO
there's	OO
nothing	OO
to	OO
live	OO
for	OO
and	OO
nothing	OO
more	OO
to	OO
expect	OO
from	OO
life	,O
the	OO
question	OO
is	OO
getting	OO
these	OO
people	OO
to	OO
realize	OO
that	OO
life	OO
is	OO
still	OO
expecting	OO
something	OO
from	OO
them	.O
doing	OU
something	OO
with	OO
someone	OO
else	OO
in	OO
mind	OO
can	OO
carry	OO
you	OO
through	OO
the	OO
toughest	OO
times	.O
you'll	OU
know	OO
the	OO
why	OO
for	OO
your	OO
existence	OO
and	OO
will	OO
be	OO
able	OO
to	OO
bear	OO
almost	OO
any	OO
how;	OO
almost	OO
any	OO
how	.O
so	OU
the	OO
question	OO
is	OO
do	OO
you	OO
do	OO
at	OO
least	OO
one	OO
thing	OO
with	OO
someone	OO
else	OO
in	OO
mind	?O
this	OU
could	OO
be	OO
volunteering	,O
or	OO
it	OO
could	OO
be	OO
sharing	OO
this	OO
knowledge	OO
that	OO
you	OO
gained	OO
today	OO
with	OO
other	OO
people	,O
especially	OO
those	OO
who	OO
need	OO
it	OO
most	,O
and	OO
these	OO
are	OO
often	OO
the	OO
people	OO
who	OO
don't	OO
have	OO
money	OO
for	OO
therapy	,O
and	OO
they're	OO
usually	OO
the	OO
ones	OO
with	OO
the	OO
highest	OO
rates	OO
of	OO
anxiety	OO

give	OU
it	OO
to	OO
them	,O
share	OO
with	OO
others	,O
because	OO
it	OO
can	OO
really	OO
improve	OO
your	OO
mental	OO
health	.O
so	OU
i	OU
would	OO
like	OO
to	OO
conclude	OO
with	OO
this:	OO
another	OO
way	OO
you	OO
can	OO
do	OO
something	OO
with	OO
someone	OO

you	OU

there's	OO
an	OO
interesting	OO
and	OO
serious	OO
point	OO
because	OO
our	OO
begrudging	OO
admiration	OO
for	OO

so	OO

that	OO
we	OO
never	OO

what	OU

it	OO

that	OO

we	OU

the	OO

—	OO
they	OO

that	OO
they're	OO
never	OO

perfect	OO
enough	.O
we	OU
know	OO
from	OO

that	OO

what's	OO

that	OO
over	OO

our	OO

john's	OU
perfectionism	,O
his	OO
unrelenting	OO
work	OO
ethic	,O
was	OO
only	OO
serving	OO
to	OO
expose	OO
what	OO
he	OO
saw	OO
as	OO
his	OO
inner	OO
weakness	OO
to	OO
himself	OO
and	OO
to	OO
others	.O
cases	OU
like	OO
john's	OU
speak	OO
to	OO
the	OO
harmfulness	OO
of	OO
perfectionism	OO
as	OO
a	OO
way	OO
of	OO
being	OO
in	OO
the	OO
world	.O
contrary	OU
to	OO
popular	OO
belief	,O
perfectionism	OO
is	OO
never	OO
about	OO
perfecting	OO
things	OO
or	OO
perfecting	OO
tasks	.O
it's	OU
not	OO
about	OO
striving	OO
for	OO
excellence	.O
john's	OU
case	OO
highlights	OO
this	OO
vividly	.O
at	OU
its	OO
root	,O
perfectionism	OO
is	OO
about	OO
perfecting	OO
the	OO
self	.O
or	,U
more	OO
precisely	,O
perfecting	OO
an	OO
imperfect	OO
self	.O
and	OU
you	OO
can	OO
think	OO
about	OO
it	OO
like	OO
a	OO
mountain	OO
of	OO
achievement	OO
that	OO
perfectionism	OO
leads	OO
us	OO
to	OO
imagine	OO
ourselves	OO
scaling	.O
and	OU
we	OO
think	OO
to	OO
ourselves	,O
once	OU
i've	OU
reached	OO
that	OO
summit	,O
then	OO
people	OO
will	OO
see	OO
i'm	OU
not	OO
flawed	,O
and	OO
i'll	OU
be	OO
worth	OO
something	.O
but	OU
what	OO
perfectionism	OO
doesn't	OO
tell	OO
us	OO
is	OO
that	OO
soon	OO
after	OO
reaching	OO
that	OO
summit	,O
we	OO
will	OO
be	OO
called	OO
down	OO
again	OO
to	OO
the	OO
fresh	OO
lowlands	OO
of	OO
insecurity	OO
and	OO
shame	,O
just	OO
to	OO
try	OO
and	OO
scale	OO
that	OO
peak	OO
again	.O
this	OU
is	OO
the	OO
cycle	OO
of	OO
self	OO
defeat	.O
in	OU
the	OO
pursuit	OO
of	OO
unattainable	OO
perfection	,O
a	OO
perfectionist	OO
just	OO
cannot	OO
step	OO
off	.O
and	OU
it's	OO
why	OO
it's	OO
so	OO
difficult	OO
to	OO
treat	.O
now	,U
we've	OO
known	OO
for	OO
decades	OO
and	OO
decades	OO
that	OO
perfectionism	OO
contributes	OO
to	OO
a	OO
host	OO
of	OO
psychological	OO
problems	,O
but	OO
there	OO
was	OO
never	OO
a	OO
good	OO
way	OO
to	OO
measure	OO
it	.O
that	OU
was	OO
until	OO
the	OO
late	OO
1980s	OO
when	OO
two	OO
canadians	,U
paul	OU
hewitt	OU
and	OO
gordon	OU
flett	,U
came	OO
along	OO
and	OO
developed	OO
a	OO
self	OO
report	OO
measure	OO
of	OO
perfectionism	.O
so	OU
that's	OO
right	,O
folks	,O
you	OO
can	OO
measure	OO
this	,O
and	OO
it	OO
essentially	OO
captures	OO
three	OO
core	OO
elements	OO
of	OO
perfectionism	.O
the	OU
first	OO
is	OO
self	OO
oriented	OO
perfectionism	,O
the	OO
irrational	OO
desire	OO
to	OO
be	OO
perfect:	OO
i	OU
strive	OO
to	OO
be	OO
as	OO
perfect	OO
as	OO
i	OU
can	OO
be	.O
the	OU
second	OO
is	OO
socially	OO
prescribed	OO
perfectionism	,O
the	OO
sense	OO
that	OO
the	OO
social	OO
environment	OO
is	OO
excessively	OO
demanding:	OO
i	OU
feel	OO
that	OO
others	OO
are	OO
too	OO
demanding	OO
of	OO
me	.O
and	OU
the	OO
third	OO
is	OO
other	OO
oriented	OO
perfectionism	,O
the	OO
imposition	OO
of	OO
unrealistic	OO
standards	OO
on	OO
other	OO
people:	OO
if	OU
i	OU
ask	OO
somebody	OO
to	OO
do	OO
something	,O
i	OU
expect	OO
it	OO
to	OO
be	OO
done	OO
perfectly	.O
now	,U
research	OO
shows	OO
that	OO
all	OO
three	OO
elements	OO
of	OO
perfectionism	OO
associate	OO
with	OO
compromised	OO
mental	OO
health	,O
including	OO
things	OO
like	OO
heightened	OO
depression	,O
heightened	OO
anxiety	OO
and	OO
suicide	OO
ideation	.O
but	,U
by	OO
far	,O
the	OO
most	OO
problematic	OO
element	OO
of	OO
perfectionism	OO
is	OO
socially	OO
prescribed	OO
perfectionism	.O
that	OU
sense	OO
that	OO
everyone	OO
expects	OO
me	OO
to	OO
be	OO
perfect	.O
this	OU
element	OO
of	OO
perfectionism	OO
has	OO
a	OO
large	OO
correlation	OO
with	OO
serious	OO
mental	OO
illness	.O
and	OU
with	OO
today's	OO
emphasis	OO
on	OO
perfection	OO
at	OO
the	OO
forefront	OO
of	OO
my	OO
mind	,O
i	OU
was	OO
curious	OO
to	OO
see	OO
whether	OO
these	OO
elements	OO
of	OO
perfectionism	OO
were	OO
changing	.O
to	OU
date	,O
research	OO
in	OO
this	OO
area	OO
is	OO
focused	OO
on	OO
immediate	OO
family	OO
relations	,O
but	OO
we	OO
wanted	OO
to	OO
look	OO
at	OO
it	OO
at	OO
a	OO
broader	OO
level	.O
so	OU
we	OO
took	OO
all	OO
of	OO
the	OO
data	OO
that	OO
had	OO
ever	OO
been	OO
collected	OO
in	OO
the	OO
27	OO
years	OO
since	OO
paul	OU
and	OO
gordon	OU
developed	OO
that	OO
perfectionism	OO
measure	,O
and	OO
we	OO
isolated	OO
the	OO
data	OO
in	OO
college	OO
students	.O
this	OU
turned	OO
out	OO
to	OO
be	OO
more	OO
than	OO
40,000	OO
young	OO
people	OO
from	OO
american	,U
canadian	OU
and	OO
british	OU
colleges	,O
and	OO
with	OO
so	OO
much	OO
data	OO
available	,O
we	OO
looked	OO
to	OO
see	OO
if	OO
there	OO
was	OO
a	OO
trend	.O
and	OU
in	OO
all	,O
it	OO
took	OO
us	OO
more	OO
than	OO
three	OO
years	OO
to	OO
collate	OO
all	OO
of	OO
this	OO
information	,O
crunch	OO
the	OO
numbers	,O
and	OO
write	OO
our	OO
report	.O
but	OU
it	OO
was	OO
worth	OO
it	OO
because	OO
our	OO
analysis	OO
uncovered	OO
something	OO
alarming	.O
all	OU
three	OO
elements	OO
of	OO
perfectionism	OO
have	OO
increased	OO
over	OO
time	.O
but	OU
socially	OO
prescribed	OO
perfectionism	OO
saw	OO
the	OO
largest	OO
increase	,O
and	OO
by	OO
far	.O
in	OU
1989	,O
just	OO
nine	OO
percent	OO
of	OO
young	OO
people	OO
report	OO
clinically	OO
relevant	OO
levels	OO
of	OO
socially	OO
prescribed	OO
perfectionism	.O
those	OU
are	OO
levels	OO
that	OO
we	OO
might	OO
typically	OO
see	OO
in	OO
clinical	OO
populations	.O
by	OU
2017	,O
that	OO
figure	OO
had	OO
doubled	OO
to	OO
18	OO
percent	.O
and	OU
by	OO
2050	,O
projections	OO
based	OO
on	OO
the	OO
models	OO
that	OO
we	OO
tested	OO
indicate	OO
that	OO
almost	OO
one	OO
in	OO
three	OO
young	OO
people	OO
will	OO
report	OO
clinically	OO
relevant	OO
levels	OO
of	OO
socially	OO
prescribed	OO
perfectionism	.O
remember	,U
this	OO
is	OO
the	OO
element	OO
of	OO
perfectionism	OO
that	OO
has	OO
the	OO
largest	OO
correlation	OO
with	OO
serious	OO
mental	OO
illness	,O
and	OO
that's	OO
for	OO
good	OO
reason	.O
socially	OU
prescribed	OO
perfectionists	OO
feel	OO
a	OO
unrelenting	OO
need	OO
to	OO
meet	OO
the	OO
expectations	OO
of	OO
other	OO
people	.O
and	OU
even	OO
if	OO
they	OO
do	OO
meet	OO
yesterday's	OO
expectation	OO
of	OO
perfection	,O
they	OO
then	OO
raise	OO
the	OO
bar	OO
on	OO
themselves	OO
to	OO
an	OO
even	OO
higher	OO
degree	OO
because	OO
these	OO
folks	OO
believe	OO
that	OO
the	OO
better	OO
they	OO
do	,O
the	OO
better	OO
that	OO
they're	OO
expected	OO
to	OO
do	.O
this	OU
breeds	OO
a	OO
profound	OO
sense	OO
of	OO
helplessness	OO
and	,O
worse	,O
hopelessness	.O
but	OU
is	OO
there	OO
hope	?O
of	OU
course	OO
there's	OO
hope	.O
perfectionists	OU
can	OO
and	OO
should	OO
hold	OO
on	OO
to	OO
certain	OO
things	OO
—	OO
they	OO
are	OO
typically	OO
bright	,O
ambitious	,O
conscientious	OO
and	OO
hardworking	.O
and	OU
yes	,O
treatment	OO
is	OO
complex	.O
but	OU
a	OO
little	OO
bit	OO
of	OO
self	OO
compassion	,O
going	OO
easy	OO
on	OO
ourselves	OO
when	OO
things	OO
don't	OO
go	OO
well	,O
can	OO
turn	OO
those	OO
qualities	OO
into	OO
greater	OO
personal	OO
peace	OO
and	OO
success	.O
and	OU
then	OO
there's	OO
what	OO
we	OO
can	OO
do	OO
as	OO
caregivers	.O
perfectionism	OU
develops	OO
in	OO
our	OO
formative	OO
years	,O
and	OO
so	OO
young	OO
people	OO
are	OO
more	OO
vulnerable	.O
parents	OU
can	OO
help	OO
their	OO
children	OO
by	OO
supporting	OO
them	OO
unconditionally	OO
when	OO
they've	OO
tried	OO
but	OO
failed	.O
and	OU
mom	OU
and	OO
dad	OU
can	OO
resist	OO
their	OO
understandable	OO
urge	OO
in	OO
today's	OO
highly	OO
competitive	OO
society	OO
to	OO
helicopter	OO
parent	,O
as	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
anxiety	OO
is	OO
communicated	OO
when	OO
parents	OO
take	OO
on	OO
their	OO
kids'	OO
successes	OO
and	OO
failures	OO
as	OO
their	OO
own	.O
but	OU
ultimately	,O
our	OO
research	OO
raises	OO
important	OO
questions	OO
about	OO
how	OO
we	OO
are	OO
structuring	OO
society	OO
and	OO
whether	OO
our	OO
society's	OO
heavy	OO
emphasis	OO
on	OO
competition	,O
evaluation	OO
and	OO
testing	OO
is	OO
benefiting	OO
young	OO
people	.O
it's	OU
become	OO
commonplace	OO
for	OO
public	OO
figures	OO
to	OO
say	OO
that	OO
young	OO
people	OO
just	OO
need	OO
a	OO
little	OO
bit	OO
more	OO
resilience	OO
in	OO
the	OO
face	OO
of	OO
these	OO
new	OO
and	OO
unprecedented	OO
pressures	.O
but	OU
i	OU
believe	OO
that	OO
is	OO
us	OO
washing	OO
our	OO
hands	OO
of	OO
the	OO
core	OO
issue	OO
because	OO
we	OO
have	OO
a	OO
shared	OO
responsibility	OO
to	OO
create	OO
a	OO
society	OO
and	OO
a	OO
culture	OO
in	OO
which	OO
young	OO
people	OO
need	OO
less	OO
perfection	OO
in	OO
the	OO
first	OO
place	.O
let's	OU
not	OO
kid	OO
ourselves	.O
creating	OU
that	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
world	OO
is	OO
an	OO
enormous	OO
challenge	,O
and	OO
for	OO
a	OO
generation	OO
of	OO
young	OO
people	OO
that	OO
live	OO
their	OO
lives	OO
in	OO
the	OO
24/7	OO
spotlight	OO
of	OO
metrics	,O
lead	OO
tables	OO
and	OO
social	OO
media	,O
perfectionism	OO
is	OO
inevitable	,O
so	OO
long	OO
as	OO
they	OO
lack	OO
any	OO
purpose	OO
in	OO
life	OO
greater	OO
than	OO
how	OO
they	OO
are	OO
appearing	OO
or	OO
how	OO
they	OO
are	OO
performing	OO
to	OO
other	OO
people	.O
what	OU
can	OO
they	OO
do	OO
about	OO
it	?O
every	OU
time	OO
they	OO
are	OO
knocked	OO
down	OO
from	OO
that	OO
mountaintop	,O
they	OO
see	OO
no	OO
other	OO
option	OO
but	OO
to	OO
try	OO
scaling	OO
that	OO
peak	OO
again	.O
the	OU
ancient	OO
greeks	OU
knew	OO
that	OO
this	OO
endless	OO
struggle	OO
up	OO
and	OO
down	OO
the	OO
same	OO
mountain	OO
is	OO
not	OO
the	OO
road	OO
to	OO
happiness	.O
their	OU
image	OO
of	OO
hell	OO
was	OO
a	OO
man	OO
called	OO
sisyphus	,U
doomed	OO
for	OO
eternity	OO
to	OO
keep	OO
rolling	OO
the	OO
same	OO
boulder	OO
up	OO
a	OO
hill	,O
only	OO
to	OO
see	OO
it	OO
roll	OO
back	OO
down	OO
and	OO
have	OO
to	OO
start	OO
again	.O
so	OU
long	OO
as	OO
we	OO
teach	OO
young	OO
people	OO
that	OO
there	OO
is	OO
nothing	OO
more	OO
real	OO
or	OO
meaningful	OO
in	OO
their	OO
lives	OO
than	OO
this	OO
hopeless	OO
quest	OO
for	OO
perfection	,O
then	OO
we	OO
are	OO
going	OO
to	OO
condemn	OO
future	OO
generations	OO
to	OO
that	OO
same	OO
futility	OO
and	OO
despair	.O
and	OU
so	OO
we're	OO
left	OO
with	OO
a	OO
question	.O
when	OU
are	OO
we	OO
going	OO
to	OO
appreciate	OO
that	OO
there	OO
is	OO
something	OO
fundamentally	OO
inhuman	OO
about	OO
limitless	OO
perfection	?O
no	OU
one	OO
is	OO
flawless	.O
if	OU
we	OO
want	OO
to	OO
help	OO
our	OO
young	OO
people	OO
escape	OO
the	OO
trap	OO
of	OO
perfectionism	,O
then	OO
we	OO
will	OO
teach	OO
them	OO
that	OO
in	OO
a	OO
chaotic	OO
world	,O
life	OO
will	OO
often	OO
defeat	OO
us	,O
but	OO
that's	OO
ok	.U
failure	OU
is	OO
not	OO
weakness	.O
if	OU
we	OO
want	OO
to	OO
help	OO
our	OO
young	OO
people	OO
outgrow	OO
this	OO
self	OO
defeating	OO
snare	OO
of	OO
impossible	OO
perfection	,O
then	OO
we	OO
will	OO
raise	OO
them	OO
in	OO
a	OO
society	OO
that	OO
has	OO
outgrown	OO
that	OO
very	OO
same	OO
delusion	.O
but	OU
most	OO
of	OO
all	,O
if	OO
we	OO
want	OO
our	OO
young	OO
people	OO
to	OO
enjoy	OO
mental	,O
emotional	OO
and	OO
psychological	OO
health	,O
then	OO
we	OO
will	OO
invite	OO
them	OO
to	OO
celebrate	OO
the	OO
joys	OO
and	OO
the	OO
beauties	OO
of	OO
imperfection	OO
as	OO
a	OO
normal	OO
and	OO
natural	OO
part	OO
of	OO

living	OO
and	OO

thank	OU
you	OO
very	OO
much	.O
try	OU
to	OO
measure	OO
a	OO
circle	.O
the	OU
diameter	OO
and	OO
radius	OO
are	OO
easy	,O
they're	OO
just	OO
straight	OO
lines	OO
you	OO
can	OO
measure	OO
with	OO
a	OO
ruler	.O
but	OU
to	OO
get	OO
the	OO
circumference	,O
you'd	OO
need	OO
measuring	OO
tape	OO
or	OO
a	OO
piece	OO
of	OO
string	,O
unless	OO
there	OO
was	OO
a	OO
better	OO
way	.O
now	,U
it's	OO
obvious	OO
that	OO
a	OO
circle's	OO
circumference	OO
would	OO
get	OO
smaller	OO
or	OO
larger	OO
along	OO
with	OO
its	OO
diameter	,O
but	OO
the	OO
relationship	OO
goes	OO
further	OO
than	OO
that	.O
in	OU
fact	,O
the	OO
ratio	OO
between	OO
the	OO
two	,O
the	OO
circumference	OO
divided	OO
by	OO
the	OO

will	OO
always	OO
be	OO
the	OO
same	OO
number	,O
no	OO

how	OO

the	OO

historians	OU
aren't	OO
sure	OO
when	OO
or	OO
how	OO
this	OO

was	OO

but	OO
it's	OO
been	OO
known	OO
in	OO
some	OO
form	OO
for	OO
almost	OO
4,000	OO
years	.O
estimates	OU
of	OO
it	OO

in	OO
the	OO

of	OO
ancient	OO
greek	,U

indian	OU
mathematicians	.O
and	OU
it's	OO

been	OO

in	OO

the	OO
egyptian	OU

it	OO

to	OO

as	OO

so	,U
when	OO

figure	OO
out	OO
the	OO

of	OO
just	OO

actually	,U
never	.O
you	OU
see	,O
the	OO
ratio	OO
of	OO
a	OO
circle's	OO
circumference	OO
to	OO
its	OO
diameter	OO
is	OO
what's	OO
known	OO
as	OO
an	OO
irrational	OO
number	,O
one	OO
that	OO
can	OO
never	OO
be	OO
expressed	OO
as	OO
a	OO
ratio	OO
of	OO

you	OU
can	OO
come	OO

no	OO

how	OO

the	OO
fraction	OO
is	,O
it	OO

be	OO
just	OO
a	OO

off	.O
so	,U
to	OO

it	OO

in	OU
every	OO

the	OO

and	OU
here's	OO
a	OO
question	.O
could	OU
you	OO
theoretically	OO
kick	OO
a	OO

hard	OO
enough	OO
to	OO
make	OO
it	OO
boomerang	OO
all	OO
the	OO
way	OO
around	OO
back	OO
to	OO
you	?O
sadly	,U
no	.O
even	OU
if	OO
the	OO
ball	OO
didn't	OO
disintegrate	OO
on	OO
impact	,O
or	OO
hit	OO
any	OO
obstacles	,O
as	OO
the	OO
air	OO
slowed	OO
it	,O
the	OO
angle	OO
of	OO
its	OO
deflection	OO
would	OO
increase	,O
causing	OO
it	OO
to	OO
spiral	OO
into	OO
smaller	OO
and	OO
smaller	OO
circles	OO
until	OO
finally	OO
stopping	.O
and	OU
just	OO
to	OO
get	OO
that	OO
spiral	,O
you'd	OO
have	OO
to	OO
make	OO
the	OO
ball	OO
spin	OO
over	OO
15	OO
times	OO
faster	OO
than	OO
carlos's	OU
immortal	OO
kick	.O
so	OU
good	OO
luck	OO
with	OO
that	.O
are	OU
you	OO
sleeping	OO

don't	OU

we've	OU
all	OO

there	.O
you're	OU
probably	OO
just	OO
stressed	OO
out	.O
stress	OU
isn't	OO

a	OO

it	OU

for	OO
a	OO

it	OO

your	OO

stress	OU
begins	OO
with	OO
something	OO
called	OO
the	OO

a	OO

of	OO

between	OO

on	OO
the	OO

your	OO

to	OO

when	OU
your	OO

detects	OO
a	OO

situation	,O
your	OO

is	OO
instantly	OO
activated	OO

releases	OO
a	OO
hormone	OO
called	OO

which	OO

but	OU
high	OO
levels	OO
of	OO
cortisol	OO
over	OO

periods	OO
of	OO

wreak	OO
havoc	OO
on	OO
your	OO

for	OU

chronic	OO
stress	OO
increases	OO
the	OO

number	OO
of	OO
neural	OO
connections	OO
in	OO
the	OO

your	OO

center	.O
and	OU

in	OO
your	OO

the	OU

inhibits	OO
the	OO

your	OO

your	OO

that's	OU

the	OU

today	,U
chocolate	OO

established	OO
itself	OO
in	OO

due	OU
to	OO

the	OO
power	OO

chocolate	OO
retains	OO
an	OO

something	OO

and	OO
forbidden	.O
yet	OU
knowing	OO
more	OO
about	OO
its	OO
fascinating	OO
and	OO
often	OO
cruel	OO
history	,O
as	OO
well	OO
as	OO
its	OO

tells	OO
us	OO
where	OO
these	OO

and	OO
what	OO

so	OU
as	OO
you	OO

take	OO
a	OO
moment	OO
to	OO

that	OO

this	OU
may	OO
look	OO

a	OO

but	OO
it's	OO
actually	OO
a	OO
mathematical	OO
treasure	OO
trove	.O
indian	OU
mathematicians	OO
called	OO
it	OO
the	OO
staircase	OU
of	OO
mount	OU
meru	.U
in	OU
iran	,U
it's	OO
the	OO
khayyam	OU
triangle	.U
and	OU
in	OO
china	,U
it's	OO
yang	OU
hui's	OU
triangle	.U
to	OU
much	OO
of	OO
the	OO
western	OU
world	,O
it's	OO
known	OO
as	OO
pascal's	OU
triangle	OU
after	OO
french	OU
mathematician	OO
blaise	OU
pascal	,U
which	OO
seems	OO
a	OO
bit	OO
unfair	OO
since	OO
he	OO
was	OO
clearly	OO
late	OO
to	OO
the	OO
party	,O
but	OO
he	OO
still	OO
had	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
to	OO
contribute	.O
so	OU
what	OO
is	OO
it	OO
about	OO
this	OO
that	OO
has	OO
so	OO
intrigued	OO
mathematicians	OO
the	OO
world	OO
over	?O
in	OU
short	,O
it's	OO
full	OO
of	OO
patterns	OO
and	OO
secrets	.O
first	OU
and	OO
foremost	,O
there's	OO
the	OO
pattern	OO
that	OO
generates	OO
it	.O
start	OU
with	OO
one	OO
and	OO
imagine	OO
invisible	OO
zeros	OO
on	OO
either	OO
side	OO
of	OO
it	.O
add	OU
them	OO
together	OO
in	OO
pairs	,O
and	OO
you'll	OO
generate	OO
the	OO
next	OO
row	.O
now	,U
do	OO
that	OO
again	OO
and	OO
again	.O
keep	OU
going	OO
and	OO
you'll	OO
wind	OO
up	OO
with	OO
something	OO
like	OO
this	,O
though	OO
really	OO
pascal's	OU
triangle	OU
goes	OO
on	OO
infinitely	.O
now	,U
each	OO
row	OO
corresponds	OO
to	OO
what's	OO
called	OO
the	OO
coefficients	OO
of	OO
a	OO
binomial	OO
expansion	OO
of	OO
the	OO
form	OO
^n	,O
where	OO
n	OO
is	OO
the	OO
number	OO
of	OO
the	OO
row	,O
and	OO
we	OO
start	OO
counting	OO
from	OO
zero	.O
so	OU
if	OO
you	OO
make	OO
n=2	OO
and	OO
expand	OO
it	,O
you	OO
get	OO
+	OO
2xy	OO
+	.O
the	OU
coefficients	,O
or	OO
numbers	OO
in	OO
front	OO
of	OO
the	OO
variables	,O
are	OO
the	OO
same	OO
as	OO
the	OO
numbers	OO
in	OO
that	OO
row	OO
of	OO
pascal's	OU
triangle	.U
you'll	OU
see	OO
the	OO
same	OO
thing	OO
with	OO
n=3	,O
which	OO
expands	OO
to	OO
this	.O
so	OU
the	OO
triangle	OO
is	OO
a	OO
quick	OO
and	OO
easy	OO
way	OO
to	OO
look	OO
up	OO
all	OO
of	OO
these	OO
coefficients	.O
but	OU
there's	OO
much	OO
more	.O
for	OU
example	,O
add	OO
up	OO
the	OO
numbers	OO
in	OO
each	OO
row	,O
and	OO
you'll	OO
get	OO
successive	OO
powers	OO
of	OO
two	.O
or	OU
in	OO
a	OO
given	OO
row	,O
treat	OO
each	OO
number	OO
as	OO
part	OO
of	OO
a	OO
decimal	OO
expansion	.O
in	OU
other	OO
words	,O
row	OO
two	OO
is	OO
+	OO
+	.O
you	OU
get	OO
121	,O
which	OO
is	OO
11^2	.O
and	OU
take	OO
a	OO
look	OO
at	OO
what	OO
happens	OO
when	OO
you	OO
do	OO
the	OO
same	OO
thing	OO
to	OO
row	OO
six	.O
it	OU
adds	OO
up	OO
to	OO
1,771,561	,O
which	OO
is	OO
11^6	,O
and	OO
so	OO
on	.O
there	OU
are	OO
also	OO
geometric	OO
applications	.O
look	OU
at	OO
the	OO
diagonals	.O
the	OU
first	OO
two	OO
aren't	OO
very	OO
interesting:	OO
all	OO
ones	,O
and	OO
then	OO
the	OO
positive	OO
integers	,O
also	OO
known	OO
as	OO
natural	OO
numbers	.O
but	OU
the	OO
numbers	OO
in	OO
the	OO
next	OO
diagonal	OO
are	OO
called	OO
the	OO
triangular	OO
numbers	OO
because	OO
if	OO
you	OO
take	OO
that	OO
many	OO
dots	,O
you	OO
can	OO
stack	OO
them	OO
into	OO
equilateral	OO
triangles	.O
the	OU
next	OO
diagonal	OO
has	OO
the	OO
tetrahedral	OO
numbers	OO
because	OO
similarly	,O
you	OO
can	OO
stack	OO
that	OO
many	OO
spheres	OO
into	OO
tetrahedra	.O
or	OU
how	OO
about	OO
this:	OO
shade	OO
in	OO
all	OO
of	OO
the	OO
odd	OO
numbers	.O
it	OU
doesn't	OO
look	OO
like	OO
much	OO
when	OO
the	OO
triangle's	OO
small	,O
but	OO
if	OO
you	OO
add	OO
thousands	OO
of	OO
rows	,O
you	OO
get	OO
a	OO
fractal	OO
known	OO
as	OO
sierpinski's	OU
triangle	.U
this	OU
triangle	OO
isn't	OO
just	OO
a	OO
mathematical	OO
work	OO
of	OO
art	.O
it's	OU
also	OO
quite	OO
useful	,O
especially	OO
when	OO
it	OO
comes	OO
to	OO
probability	OO
and	OO
calculations	OO
in	OO
the	OO
domain	OO
of	OO
combinatorics	.O
say	OU
you	OO
want	OO
to	OO
have	OO
five	OO
children	,O
and	OO
would	OO
like	OO
to	OO
know	OO
the	OO
probability	OO
of	OO
having	OO
your	OO
dream	OO
family	OO
of	OO
three	OO
girls	OO
and	OO
two	OO
boys	.O
in	OU
the	OO
binomial	OO
expansion	,O
that	OO
corresponds	OO
to	OO
girl	OO
plus	OO
boy	OO
to	OO
the	OO
fifth	OO
power	.O
so	OU
we	OO
look	OO
at	OO
the	OO
row	OO
five	,O
where	OO
the	OO
first	OO
number	OO
corresponds	OO
to	OO
five	OO
girls	,O
and	OO
the	OO

corresponds	OO
to	OO
five	OO

the	OU

is	OO
what	OO
we're	OO

for	.O
ten	OU
out	OO
of	OO
the	OO

of	OO
all	OO
the	OO

in	OO
the	OO

so	OO
10/32	,O
or	OO
31.25%	.O
or	,U
if	OO
you're	OO

you'd	OO

for	OU

this	OO

strange	.O
after	OU
all	,O

of	OO
our	OO

on	OO

whether	OO

so	OU
it's	OO

a	OO
good	OO

and	OU
up	OO
until	OO
a	OO

sometimes	,O
the	OO

the	OO

this	OU

called	OO
the	OO
paradox	OO
of	OO
unanimity	.O
the	OU
key	OO
to	OO
understanding	OO
this	OO
apparent	OO
paradox	OO
is	OO
in	OO
considering	OO
the	OO
overall	OO
level	OO
of	OO
uncertainty	OO
involved	OO
in	OO
the	OO
type	OO
of	OO
situation	OO
you're	OO
dealing	OO
with	.O
if	OU
we	OO
asked	OO
witnesses	OO
to	OO
identify	OO
the	OO

in	OO
this	OO

for	OO
example	,O
we	OO
shouldn't	OO
be	OO
surprised	OO
by	OO
a	OO

but	OU
in	OO
cases	OO
where	OO
we	OO
have	OO
reason	OO
to	OO
expect	OO
some	OO
natural	OO

we	OO
should	OO
also	OO
expect	OO

if	OU
you	OO

a	OO

you	OO
would	OO
expect	OO
to	OO
get	OO
heads	OO
somewhere	OO
around	OO
50%	OO
of	OO
the	OO
time	.O
but	OU
if	OO
your	OO
results	OO
started	OO
to	OO
approach	OO
100%	OO
heads	,O
you'd	OO
suspect	OO
that	OO
something	OO
was	OO
wrong	,O
not	OO
with	OO
your	OO
individual	OO
flips	,O
but	OO
with	OO
the	OO
coin	OO
itself	.O
of	OU
course	,O
suspect	OO
identifications	OO
aren't	OO
as	OO
random	OO
as	OO

but	OO
they're	OO
not	OO
as	OO
clear	OO

as	OO
telling	OO

from	OO

either	.O
in	OU
fact	,O
a	OO
1994	OO

that	OO
up	OO
to	OO
48%	OO
of	OO

to	OO

the	OO

person	OO
out	OO
of	OO
a	OO

even	OO
when	OO
many	OO
are	OO
confident	OO
in	OO
their	OO
choice	.O
memory	OU
based	OO
on	OO
short	OO

can	OO
be	OO
unreliable	,O

we	OO
often	OO
overestimate	OO
our	OO

accuracy	.O
knowing	OU
all	OO
this	,O
a	OO
unanimous	OO
identification	OO
starts	OO
to	OO
seem	OO
less	OO
like	OO
certain	OO
guilt	,O
and	OO
more	OO
like	OO
a	OO
systemic	OO
error	,O
or	OO
bias	OO
in	OO
the	OO
lineup	.O
and	OU
systemic	OO
errors	OO
don't	OO
just	OO
appear	OO
in	OO
matters	OO
of	OO
human	OO
judgement	.O
from	OU
1993	OO
2008	,O
the	OO

around	OO
europe	,U
incriminating	OO
an	OO

dubbed	OO
the	OO

but	OU
the	OO
dna	OU
evidence	OO
was	OO
so	OO
consistent	OO
precisely	OO
because	OO
it	OO

it	OU
turned	OO

that	OO
the	OO

in	OU
other	OO
cases	,O

like	OO
the	OO

100%	OO

of	OO

seven	OO

when	OU
you	OO
look	OO
at	OO
it	OO
this	OO
way	,O
the	OO
paradox	OO
of	OO
unanimity	OO
isn't	OO
actually	OO
all	OO
that	OO
paradoxical	.O
unanimous	OU
agreement	OO
is	OO
still	OO
theoretically	OO
ideal	,O
especially	OO
in	OO
cases	OO
when	OO
you'd	OO
expect	OO
very	OO
low	OO
odds	OO
of	OO
variability	OO
and	OO
uncertainty	,O
but	OO
in	OO
practice	,O
achieving	OO
it	OO
in	OO
situations	OO
where	OO
perfect	OO
agreement	OO
is	OO
highly	OO
unlikely	OO
should	OO
tell	OO
us	OO
that	OO
there's	OO
probably	OO
some	OO
hidden	OO
factor	OO
affecting	OO
the	OO

although	OU
we	OO
may	OO
strive	OO
for	OO
harmony	OO
and	OO
consensus	,O
in	OO
many	OO
situations	,O
error	OO
and	OO

should	OO
be	OO
naturally	OO
expected	.O
and	OU
if	OO
a	OO
perfect	OO
result	OO
seems	OO
too	OO
good	OO
to	OO
be	OO
true	,O
it	OO
probably	OO
is	.O
when	OU
you	OO
hear	OO
the	OO
word	OO
symmetry	,O
maybe	OO
you	OO
picture	OO
a	OO
simple	OO
geometric	OO
shape	OO
like	OO
a	OO
square	OO
or	OO
a	OO
triangle	,O
or	OO
the	OO
complex	OO
pattern	OO
on	OO
a	OO
butterfly's	OO
wings	.O
if	OU
you	OO
are	OO
artistically	OO
inclined	,O
you	OO
might	OO
think	OO
of	OO
the	OO
subtle	OO
modulations	OO
of	OO
a	OO
mozart	OU
concerto	,O
or	OO
the	OO
effortless	OO
poise	OO
of	OO
a	OO
prima	OO
ballerina	.O
when	OU
used	OO
in	OO
every	OO
day	OO
life	,O
the	OO
word	OO
symmetry	OO
represents	OO
vague	OO
notions	OO
of	OO
beauty	,O
harmony	OO
and	OO
balance	.O
in	OU
math	OO
and	OO
science	,O
symmetry	OO
has	OO
a	OO
different	,O
and	OO
very	OO
specific	,O
meaning	.O
in	OU
this	OO
technical	OO
sense	,O
a	OO
symmetry	OO
is	OO
the	OO
property	OO
of	OO
an	OO
object	.O
pretty	OU
much	OO
any	OO
type	OO
of	OO
object	OO
can	OO
have	OO
symmetry	,O
from	OO
tangible	OO
things	OO
like	OO
butterflies	,O
to	OO
abstract	OO
entities	OO
like	OO
geometric	OO
shapes	.O
so	,U
what	OO
does	OO
it	OO
mean	OO
for	OO
an	OO
object	OO
to	OO
be	OO
symmetric	?O
here's	OU
the	OO
definition:	OO
a	OO
symmetry	OO
is	OO
a	OO
transformation	OO
that	OO
leaves	OO
that	OO
object	OO
unchanged	.O
okay	,U
that	OO
sounds	OO
a	OO
bit	OO
abstract	,O
so	OO
let's	OO
unpack	OO
it	.O
it	OU
will	OO
help	OO
to	OO
look	OO
at	OO
a	OO
particular	OO
example	,O
like	OO
this	OO
equilateral	OO
triangle	.O
if	OU
we	OO
rotate	OO
our	OO
triangle	OO
through	OO
120	OO
degrees	,O
around	OO
an	OO
access	OO
through	OO
its	OO
center	,O
we	OO
end	OO
up	OO
with	OO
a	OO
triangle	OO
that's	OO
identical	OO
to	OO
the	OO
original	.O
in	OU
this	OO
case	,O
the	OO
object	OO
is	OO
the	OO
triangle	,O
and	OO
the	OO
transformation	OO
that	OO
leaves	OO
the	OO
object	OO
unchanged	OO
is	OO
rotation	OO
through	OO
120	OO
degrees	.O
so	OU
we	OO
can	OO
say	OO
an	OO
equilateral	OO
triangle	OO
is	OO
symmetric	OO
with	OO
respect	OO
to	OO
rotations	OO
of	OO
120	OO
degrees	OO
around	OO
its	OO
center	.O
if	OU
we	OO
rotated	OO
the	OO
triangle	OO
by	,O
say	,O
90	OO
degrees	OO
instead	,O
the	OO
rotated	OO
triangle	OO
would	OO
look	OO
different	OO
to	OO
the	OO
original	.O
in	OU
other	OO
words	,O
an	OO
equilateral	OO
triangle	OO
is	OO
not	OO
symmetric	OO
with	OO
respect	OO
to	OO
rotations	OO
of	OO
90	OO
degrees	OO
around	OO
its	OO
center	.O
but	OU
why	OO
do	OO
mathematicians	OO
and	OO
scientists	OO
care	OO
about	OO
symmetries	?O
turns	OU
out	,O
they're	OO
essential	OO
in	OO
many	OO
fields	OO
of	OO
math	OO
and	OO
science	.O
let's	OU
take	OO
a	OO
close	OO
look	OO
at	OO
one	OO
example:	OO
symmetry	OO
in	OO
biology	.O
you	OU
might	OO
have	OO
noticed	OO
that	OO
there's	OO
a	OO
very	OO
familiar	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
symmetry	OO
we	OO
haven't	OO
mentioned	OO
yet:	OO
the	OO
symmetry	OO
of	OO
the	OO
right	OO
and	OO
left	OO
sides	OO
of	OO
the	OO
human	OO
body	.O
the	OU
transformation	OO
that	OO
gives	OO
this	OO
symmetry	OO
is	OO
reflection	OO
by	OO
an	OO
imaginary	OO
mirror	OO
that	OO
slices	OO
vertically	OO
through	OO
the	OO
body	.O
biologists	OU
call	OO
this	OO
bilateral	OO
symmetry	.O
as	OU
with	OO
all	OO
symmetries	OO
found	OO
in	OO
living	OO
things	,O
it's	OO
only	OO
approximate	,O
but	OO
still	OO
a	OO
striking	OO
feature	OO
of	OO
the	OO
human	OO
body	.O
we	OU
humans	OO
aren't	OO
the	OO
only	OO
bilaterally	OO
symmetric	OO
organisms	.O
many	OU
other	OO
animals	,O
foxes	,O
sharks	,O
beetles	,O
that	OO
butterfly	OO
we	OO
mentioned	OO
earlier	,O
have	OO
this	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
symmetry	,O
as	OO
do	OO
some	OO
plants	OO
like	OO
orchid	OO
flowers	.O
other	OU
organisms	OO
have	OO
different	OO
symmetries	,O
ones	OO
that	OO
only	OO
become	OO
apparent	OO
when	OO
you	OO
rotate	OO
the	OO
organism	OO
around	OO
its	OO
center	OO
point	.O
it's	OU
a	OO
lot	OO
like	OO
the	OO
rotational	OO
symmetry	OO
of	OO
the	OO
triangle	OO
we	OO
watched	OO
earlier	.O
but	OU
when	OO
it	OO
occurs	OO
in	OO
animals	,O
this	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
symmetry	OO
is	OO
known	OO
as	OO
radial	OO
symmetry	.O
for	OU
instance	,O
some	OO
sea	OO
urchins	OO
and	OO
starfish	OO
have	OO
pentaradial	OO
or	OO
five	OO
fold	OO
symmetry	,O
that	OO
is	,O
symmetry	OO
with	OO
respect	OO
to	OO
rotations	OO
of	OO
72	OO
degrees	OO
around	OO
their	OO
center	.O
this	OU
symmetry	OO
also	OO
appears	OO
in	OO
plants	,O
as	OO
you	OO
can	OO
see	OO
for	OO
yourself	OO
by	OO
slicing	OO
through	OO
an	OO
apple	OO
horizontally	.O
some	OU
jellyfish	OO
are	OO
symmetric	OO
with	OO
respect	OO
to	OO
rotations	OO
of	OO
90	OO
degrees	,O
while	OO
sea	OO
anemones	OO
are	OO
symmetric	OO
when	OO
you	OO
rotate	OO
them	OO
at	OO
any	OO
angle	.O
some	OU
corals	,O
on	OO
the	OO
other	OO
hand	,O
have	OO
no	OO
symmetry	OO
at	OO
all	.O
they	OU
are	OO
completely	OO
asymmetric	.O
but	OU
why	OO
do	OO
organisms	OO
exhibit	OO
these	OO
different	OO
symmetries	?O
does	OU
body	OO
symmetry	OO
tell	OO
us	OO
anything	OO
about	OO
an	OO
animal's	OO
lifestyle	?O
let's	OU
look	OO
at	OO
one	OO
particular	OO
group:	OO
bilaterally	OO
symmetric	OO
animals	.O
in	OU
this	OO
camp	,O
we	OO
have	OO
foxes	,O
beetles	,O
sharks	,O
butterflies	,O
and	,O
of	OO
course	,O
humans	.O
the	OU
thing	OO
that	OO
unites	OO
bilaterally	OO
symmetric	OO
animals	OO
is	OO
that	OO
their	OO
bodies	OO
are	OO
designed	OO
around	OO
movement	.O
if	OU
you	OO
want	OO
to	OO
pick	OO
one	OO
direction	OO
and	OO
move	OO
that	OO
way	,O
it	OO
helps	OO
to	OO
have	OO
a	OO
front	OO
end	OO
where	OO
you	OO
can	OO
group	OO
your	OO
sensory	OO
organs—	OO
your	OO
eyes	,O
ears	OO
and	OO
nose	.O
it	OU
helps	OO
to	OO
have	OO
your	OO
mouth	OO
there	OO
too	OO
since	OO
you're	OO
more	OO
likely	OO
to	OO
run	OO
into	OO
food	OO
or	OO

that's	OU
what	OO

these	OU

to	OO

in	OO
the	OO

system	.O
normally	,U
the	OO
brain's	OO
electrical	OO
signals	OO
are	OO
a	OO

chorus	OO
as	OO

parts	OO

with	OO

that	OU

as	OO

there's	OU

the	OU

most	OU

the	OO

to	OO

this	OO
technology	OO
today	.O
technology	OU
that	OO
they	OO
could	OO
have	OO
created	OO
in	OO
any	OO
way	OO
they	OO
wanted	.O
and	OU
yet	,O
they	OO
have	OO
chosen	OO
to	OO
create	OO
it	OO
in	OO
the	OO
style	OO
of	OO
1950s	OO
mad	OU
man	OU
secretary	.O
yay	.U
but	OU
ok	,U
don't	OO
worry	,O
this	OO
is	OO
not	OO
going	OO
to	OO
end	OO
with	OO
me	OO
telling	OO
you	OO
that	OO
we	OO
are	OO
all	OO
heading	OO
towards	OO
sexist	,O
racist	OO
machines	OO
running	OO
the	OO
world	.O
the	OU
good	OO
news	OO
about	OO
ai	OU
is	OO
that	OO
it	OO
is	OO
entirely	OO
within	OO
our	OO
control	.O
we	OU
get	OO
to	OO
teach	OO
the	OO
right	OO
values	,O
the	OO
right	OO
ethics	OO
to	OO
ai	.U
so	OU
there	OO
are	OO
three	OO
things	OO
we	OO
can	OO
do	.O
one	,U
we	OO
can	OO
be	OO
aware	OO
of	OO
our	OO
own	OO
biases	OO
and	OO
the	OO
bias	OO
in	OO
machines	OO
around	OO
us	.O
two	,U
we	OO
can	OO
make	OO
sure	OO
that	OO
diverse	OO
teams	OO
are	OO
building	OO
this	OO
technology	.O
and	OU
three	,O
we	OO
have	OO
to	OO
give	OO
it	OO
diverse	OO
experiences	OO
to	OO
learn	OO
from	.O
i	OU
can	OO
talk	OO
about	OO
the	OO
first	OO
two	OO
from	OO
personal	OO
experience	.O
when	OU
you	OO
work	OO
in	OO
technology	OO
and	OO
you	OO
don't	OO
look	OO
like	OO
a	OO
mark	OU
zuckerberg	OU
or	OO
elon	OU
musk	,U
your	OO
life	OO
is	OO
a	OO
little	OO
bit	OO
difficult	,O
your	OO
ability	OO
gets	OO
questioned	.O
here's	OU
just	OO
one	OO
example	.O
like	OU
most	OO
developers	,O
i	OU
often	OO
join	OO
online	OO
tech	OO
forums	OO
and	OO
share	OO
my	OO
knowledge	OO
to	OO
help	OO
others	.O
and	OU
i've	OU
found	,O
when	OO
i	OU
log	OO
on	OO
as	OO
myself	,O
with	OO
my	OO
own	OO
photo	,O
my	OO
own	OO
name	,O
i	OU
tend	OO
to	OO
get	OO
questions	OO
or	OO
comments	OO
like	OO
this:	OO
what	OU
makes	OO
you	OO
think	OO
you're	OO
qualified	OO
to	OO
talk	OO
about	OO
ai	?U
what	OU
makes	OO
you	OO
think	OO
you	OO
know	OO
about	OO
machine	OO
learning	?O
so	,U
as	OO
you	OO
do	,O
i	OU
made	OO
a	OO
new	OO
profile	,O
and	OO
this	OO
time	,O
instead	OO
of	OO
my	OO
own	OO
picture	,O
i	OU
chose	OO
a	OO
cat	OO
with	OO
a	OO
jet	OO
pack	OO
on	OO
it	.O
and	OU
i	OU
chose	OO
a	OO
name	OO
that	OO
did	OO
not	OO
reveal	OO
my	OO
gender	.O
you	OU
can	OO
probably	OO
guess	OO
where	OO
this	OO
is	OO
going	,O
right	?O
so	,U
this	OO
time	,O
i	OU
didn't	OO
get	OO
any	OO
of	OO
those	OO
patronizing	OO
comments	OO
about	OO
my	OO
ability	OO
and	OO
i	OU
was	OO
able	OO
to	OO
actually	OO
get	OO
some	OO
work	OO
done	.O
and	OU
it	OO
sucks	,O
guys	.O
i've	OU
been	OO
building	OO
robots	OO
since	OO
i	OU
was	OO
15	,O
i	OU
have	OO
a	OO
few	OO
degrees	OO
in	OO
computer	OO
science	,O
and	OO
yet	,O
i	OU
had	OO
to	OO
hide	OO
my	OO
gender	OO
in	OO
order	OO
for	OO
my	OO
work	OO
to	OO
be	OO
taken	OO
seriously	.O
so	,U
what's	OO
going	OO
on	OO
here	?O
are	OU
men	OO
just	OO
better	OO
at	OO
technology	OO
than	OO
women	?O
another	OU
study	OO
found	OO
that	OO
when	OO
women	OO
coders	OO
on	OO
one	OO
platform	OO
hid	OO
their	OO
gender	,O
like	OO
myself	,O
their	OO
code	OO
was	OO
accepted	OO
four	OO
percent	OO
more	OO
than	OO
men	.O
so	OU
this	OO
is	OO
not	OO
about	OO
the	OO
talent	.O
this	OU
is	OO
about	OO
an	OO
elitism	OO
in	OO
ai	OU
that	OO
says	OO
a	OO
programmer	OO
needs	OO
to	OO
look	OO
like	OO
a	OO
certain	OO
person	.O
what	OU
we	OO
really	OO
need	OO
to	OO
do	OO
to	OO
make	OO
ai	OU
better	OO
is	OO
bring	OO
people	OO
from	OO
all	OO
kinds	OO
of	OO

we	OU
need	OO
people	OO
who	OO
can	OO

we	OU

who	OO

we	OU

people	OO
who	OO

we	OO

people	OO
who	OO

tell	OO
us	OO
what	OO
are	OO
the	OO
real	OO
issues	OO
that	OO

fixing	OO
and	OO
help	OO
us	OO
find	OO
ways	OO
that	OO

actually	OO
fix	OO
it	.O
because	,U
when	OO

when	OO
we	OO

in	OO
the	OO

the	OO

and	OU
that's	OO
what	OO
i	OU
want	OO
to	OO

by	OO
talking	OO
to	OO
you	OO

less	OU

that	OO

and	OO
more	OO
about	OO
what	OO

some	OO
of	OO
the	OO

the	OO

in	OO
the	OO

a	OO

of	OO
it	OO

towards	OO
making	OO
the	OO

what	OU

i	OU

i'll	OU

the	OO

about	OO
the	OO

but	OU
i	OU
feel	OO
incredibly	OO
positive	OO
about	OO
this	OO

this	OU

our	OO
chance	OO
to	OO
remake	OO
the	OO

into	OO
a	OO
much	OO
more	OO
equal	OO

to	OO
do	OO
that	,O
we	OO

to	OO

it	OO
the	OO

from	OO

we	OU
need	OO
people	OO
of	OO

we	OU

women	OO
to	OO

the	OO
makers	OO
and	OO
not	OO
just	OO
the	OO
machines	OO
who	OO
do	OO
the	OO

we	OU

to	OO
think	OO
very	OO
carefully	OO
what	OO
we	OO

we've	OO
only	OO
just	OO
scratched	OO
the	OO

of	OO
what	OO

with	OO
ai	.U
thank	OU
you	.O
as	OU
the	OO
story	OO
goes	,O
the	OO
legendary	OO
marksman	OO
william	OU
tell	OU
was	OO
forced	OO
into	OO
a	OO
cruel	OO
challenge	OO
by	OO
a	OO
corrupt	OO
lord	.O
william's	OU
son	OO
was	OO
to	OO
be	OO
executed	OO
unless	OO
william	OU
could	OO
shoot	OO
an	OO
apple	OO
off	OO
his	OO
head	.O
william	OU
succeeded	,O
but	OO
let's	OO
imagine	OO
two	OO
variations	OO
on	OO
the	OO
tale	.O
in	OU
the	OO
first	OO
variation	,O
the	OO
lord	OO
hires	OO
a	OO
bandit	OO
to	OO
steal	OO
william's	OU
trusty	OO
crossbow	,O
so	OO
he	OO
is	OO
forced	OO
to	OO
borrow	OO
an	OO
inferior	OO
one	OO
from	OO
a	OO
peasant	.O
however	,U
the	OO
borrowed	OO
crossbow	OO
isn't	OO
adjusted	OO
perfectly	,O
and	OO
william	OU
finds	OO
that	OO
his	OO
practice	OO
shots	OO
cluster	OO
in	OO
a	OO
tight	OO
spread	OO
beneath	OO
the	OO
bullseye	.O
fortunately	,U
he	OO
has	OO
time	OO
to	OO
correct	OO
for	OO
it	OO
before	OO
it's	OO
too	OO
late	.O
variation	OU
two:	OO
william	OU
begins	OO
to	OO
doubt	OO
his	OO
skills	OO
in	OO
the	OO
long	OO
hours	OO
before	OO
the	OO
challenge	OO
and	OO
his	OO
hand	OO
develops	OO
a	OO
tremor	.O
his	OU
practice	OO
shots	OO
still	OO
cluster	OO
around	OO
the	OO
apple	OO
but	OO
in	OO
a	OO
random	OO
pattern	.O
occasionally	,U
he	OO
hits	OO
the	OO
apple	,O
but	OO
with	OO
the	OO
wobble	,O
there	OO
is	OO
no	OO
guarantee	OO
of	OO
a	OO
bullseye	.O
he	OU
must	OO
settle	OO
his	OO
nervous	OO
hand	OO
and	OO
restore	OO
the	OO
certainty	OO
in	OO
his	OO
aim	OO
to	OO
save	OO
his	OO
son	.O
at	OU
the	OO
heart	OO
of	OO
these	OO
variations	OO
are	OO
two	OO
terms	OO
often	OO
used	OO
interchangeably:	OO
accuracy	OO
and	OO
precision	.O
the	OU
distinction	OO
between	OO
the	OO
two	OO
is	OO
actually	OO
critical	OO
for	OO
many	OO
scientific	OO
endeavours	.O
accuracy	OU
involves	OO
how	OO
close	OO
you	OO
come	OO
to	OO
the	OO
correct	OO
result	.O
your	OU
accuracy	OO
improves	OO
with	OO
tools	OO
that	OO
are	OO
calibrated	OO
correctly	OO
and	OO
that	OO
you're	OO
well	OO
trained	OO
on	.O
precision	,U
on	OO
the	OO
other	OO
hand	,O
is	OO
how	OO
consistently	OO
you	OO
can	OO
get	OO
that	OO
result	OO
using	OO
the	OO
same	OO
method	.O
your	OU
precision	OO
improves	OO
with	OO
more	OO
finely	OO
incremented	OO
tools	OO
that	OO
require	OO
less	OO
estimation	.O
the	OU
story	OO
of	OO
the	OO
stolen	OO
crossbow	OO
was	OO
one	OO
of	OO
precision	OO
without	OO
accuracy	.O
william	OU
got	OO
the	OO
same	OO
wrong	OO
result	OO
each	OO
time	OO
he	OO
fired	.O
the	OU
variation	OO
with	OO
the	OO
shaky	OO
hand	OO
was	OO
one	OO
of	OO
accuracy	OO
without	OO
precision	.O
william's	OU
bolts	OO
clustered	OO
around	OO
the	OO
correct	OO
result	,O
but	OO
without	OO
certainty	OO
of	OO
a	OO
bullseye	OO
for	OO
any	OO
given	OO
shot	.O
you	OU
can	OO
probably	OO
get	OO
away	OO
with	OO
low	OO
accuracy	OO
or	OO
low	OO
precision	OO
in	OO
everyday	OO
tasks	.O
but	OU
engineers	OO
and	OO
researchers	OO
often	OO
require	OO
accuracy	OO
on	OO
microscopic	OO
levels	OO
with	OO
a	OO
high	OO
certainty	OO
of	OO
being	OO
right	OO
every	OO
time	.O
factories	OU
and	OO
labs	OO
increase	OO
precision	OO
through	OO
better	OO
equipment	OO
and	OO
more	OO
detailed	OO
procedures	.O
these	OU
improvements	OO
can	OO
be	OO
expensive	,O
so	OO
managers	OO
must	OO
decide	OO
what	OO
the	OO
acceptable	OO
uncertainty	OO
for	OO
each	OO
project	OO
is	.O
however	,U
investments	OO
in	OO

let's	OU

at	OO
what	OO

when	OO

it	OU

with	OO
an	OO

the	OO

the	OU

that	OO

that	OO

a	OO

of	OO

alive	OO
while	OO

what	OU

if	OU
we	OO

to	OO

the	OO

with	OO

of	OO
the	OO

to	OO
increase	OO
the	OO

of	OO

it	OO
turns	OO
out	OO
he	OO
can	OO

than	OO
that	.O
why	?U
like	OU
we	OO
said	,O
the	OO
pirates	OO
all	OO
know	OO
each	OO

to	OO
be	OO
top	OO

logicians	.O
so	OU
when	OO
each	OO

they	OO
won't	OO
just	OO
be	OO
thinking	OO
about	OO
the	OO
current	OO
proposal	,O
but	OO
about	OO
all	OO
possible	OO
outcomes	OO
down	OO
the	OO
line	.O
and	OU
because	OO
the	OO
rank	OO

each	OO
can	OO
accurately	OO
predict	OO
how	OO
the	OO

would	OO
vote	OO
in	OO
any	OO
situation	OO
and	OO
adjust	OO
their	OO

accordingly	.O
because	OU
eliza's	OU
last	,O
she	OO
has	OO
the	OO
most	OO
outcomes	OO
to	OO
consider	,O
so	OO
let's	OO
start	OO
by	OO
following	OO
her	OO
thought	OO
process	.O
she'd	OU
reason	OO
this	OO
out	OO
by	OO
working	OO
backwards	OO
from	OO
the	OO
last	OO
possible	OO
scenario	OO
with	OO
only	OO
her	OO
and	OO
daniel	OU
remaining	.O
daniel	OU
would	OO
obviously	OO
propose	OO
to	OO
keep	OO
all	OO
the	OO
gold	OO
and	OO
eliza's	OU
one	OO
vote	OO
would	OO
not	OO
be	OO
enough	OO
to	OO
override	OO
him	,O
so	OO
eliza	OU
wants	OO
to	OO
avoid	OO
this	OO
situation	OO
at	OO
all	OO
costs	.O
now	OU
we	OO
move	OO
to	OO
the	OO
previous	OO
decision	OO
point	OO
with	OO
three	OO
pirates	OO
left	OO
and	OO
charlotte	OU
making	OO
the	OO
proposal	.O
everyone	OU
knows	OO
that	OO
if	OO
she's	OO
outvoted	,O
the	OO
decision	OO
moves	OO
to	OO
daniel	,U
who	OO
will	OO
then	OO
get	OO
all	OO
the	OO
gold	OO
while	OO
eliza	OU
gets	OO
nothing	.O
so	OU
to	OO
secure	OO
eliza's	OU
vote	,O
charlotte	OU
only	OO
needs	OO
to	OO
offer	OO
her	OO
slightly	OO
more	OO
than	OO
nothing	,O
one	OO

since	OU
this	OO
ensures	OO
her	OO

charlotte	OU
doesn't	OO
need	OO
to	OO

daniel	OU
anything	OO
at	OO
all	.O
what	OU
if	OO
there	OO
are	OO
four	OO
pirates	?O
as	OU

would	OO
still	OO
only	OO

one	OO

he	OU

that	OO
daniel	OU

the	OO

so	OO
he	OO
would	OO

daniel	OU
one	OO

for	OO
his	OO
support	OO
with	OO
nothing	OO
for	OO
charlotte	OU
or	OO
eliza	.U
now	OU
we're	OO
back	OO
at	OO
the	OO
initial	OO
vote	OO
with	OO
all	OO
five	OO
pirates	OO
standing	.O
having	OU
considered	OO
all	OO
the	OO
other	OO
scenarios	,O
amaro	OU
knows	OO
that	OO
if	OO
he	OO
goes	OO
overboard	,O
the	OO
decision	OO
comes	OO
down	OO
to	OO
bart	,U
which	OO
would	OO
be	OO
bad	OO
news	OO
for	OO
charlotte	OU
and	OO
eliza	.U
so	OU
he	OO
offers	OO
them	OO
one	OO
coin	OO
each	,O
keeping	OO
98	OO
for	OO
himself	.O
bart	OU
and	OO
daniel	OU
vote	OO
nay	,O
but	OO
charlotte	OU
and	OO
eliza	OU
grudgingly	OO
vote	OO
yarr	OO
knowing	OO
that	OO
the	OO
alternative	OO
would	OO
be	OO
worse	OO
for	OO
them	.O
the	OU
pirate	OO
game	OO
involves	OO
some	OO
interesting	OO
concepts	OO
from	OO
game	OO
theory	.O
one	OU
is	OO
the	OO
concept	OO
of	OO
common	OO
knowledge	OO
where	OO
each	OO
person	OO
is	OO
aware	OO
of	OO
what	OO
the	OO
others	OO
know	OO
and	OO
uses	OO
this	OO
to	OO
predict	OO
their	OO
reasoning	.O
and	OU
the	OO
final	OO
distribution	OO
is	OO
an	OO
example	OO
of	OO
a	OO
nash	OU
equilibrium	OO
where	OO
each	OO
player	OO
knows	OO
every	OO
other	OO
players'	OO
strategy	OO
and	OO
chooses	OO
theirs	OO
accordingly	.O
even	OU
though	OO
it	OO
may	OO
lead	OO
to	OO
a	OO
worse	OO
outcome	OO
for	OO

than	OO

no	OO
individual	OO
player	OO
can	OO
benefit	OO
by	OO
changing	OO
their	OO
strategy	.O
so	OU
it	OO
looks	OO
like	OO
amaro	OU

to	OO
keep	OO
most	OO
of	OO
the	OO

the	OO

the	OU

unfortunately	,U
you	OO

can	OU
you	OO

in:	OO
2	OO
answer	OU
in:	OO
1	OO
to	OU
solve	OO
this	OO
problem	,O
we	OO
need	OO
to	OO
visualize	OO
it	.O
for	OU
starters	,O
we	OO
know	OO
that	OO
on	OO
the	OO
correct	OO
floor	OO
there's	OO
one	OO
room	,O
let's	OO
call	OO
it	OO
room	OO
a	,U
with	OO
one	OO
door	OO
to	OO
the	OO
control	OO
panel	OO
room	,O
plus	OO
one	OO
door	OO
to	OO
room	OO
b	,U
and	OO
one	OO
to	OO
c	.U
so	OU
there	OO
must	OO
be	OO
at	OO
least	OO
four	OO
rooms	,O
which	OO
we	OO
can	OO
represent	OO
as	OO
circles	,O
drawing	OO
lines	OO
between	OO
them	OO
for	OO
the	OO
doorways	.O
but	OU
once	OO
we	OO
connect	OO
rooms	OO
b	OU
and	OO
c	,U
there	OO
are	OO
no	OO
other	OO
connections	OO
possible	,O
so	OO
the	OO
fourth	OO
floor	OO
down	OO
from	OO
the	OO
top	OO
is	OO
out	.O
we	OU
know	OO
the	OO
control	OO
panel	OO
has	OO
to	OO
be	OO
as	OO
high	OO
up	OO
as	OO
possible	,O
so	OO
let's	OO
make	OO
our	OO
way	OO
down	OO
the	OO
pyramid	.O
the	OU
fifth	OO
highest	OO
floor	OO
doesn't	OO
work	OO
either	.O
we	OU
can	OO
figure	OO
that	OO
out	OO
by	OO
drawing	OO
it	,O
but	OO
to	OO
be	OO
sure	OO
we	OO
haven't	OO
missed	OO
any	OO
possibilities	,O
here's	OO
another	OO
way	.O
every	OU
door	OO
corresponds	OO
to	OO
a	OO
line	OO
in	OO
our	OO
graph	OO
that	OO
makes	OO
two	OO
rooms	OO
into	OO
neighbors	.O
so	OU
in	OO
the	OO
end	,O
there	OO
have	OO
to	OO
be	OO
an	OO
even	OO
number	OO
of	OO
neighbors	OO
no	OO
matter	OO
how	OO
many	OO
connections	OO
we	OO
make	.O
on	OU
the	OO
fifth	OO
highest	OO
floor	,O
to	OO
fulfill	OO
our	OO
starting	OO
conditions	,O
we'd	OO
need	OO
four	OO
rooms	OO
with	OO
three	OO
neighbors	OO
each	,O
plus	OO
the	OO
control	OO
panel	OO
room	OO
with	OO
one	OO
neighbor	,O
which	OO
makes	OO
13	OO
total	OO
neighbors	.O
since	OU
that's	OO
an	OO
odd	OO
number	,O
it's	OO
not	OO
possible	,O
and	,O
in	OO
fact	,O
this	OO
also	OO
rules	OO
out	OO
every	OO
floor	OO
that	OO
has	OO
an	OO
odd	OO
number	OO
of	OO
rooms	.O
so	OU
let's	OO
go	OO
one	OO
more	OO
floor	OO
down	.O
when	OU
we	OO
draw	OO
out	OO
the	OO
rooms	,O
low	OO
and	OO

we	OO
can	OO
find	OO

every	OU

off	OO
the	OO

so	OO
that	OO
instead	OO
of	OO
a	OO

it’s	OO
an	OO

when	OU
we	OO

that’s	OU

that’s	OU

now	,U

a	OO

about	OO

—	OO
about	OO
how	OO
it	OO

and	OO
what	OO
it	OO

a	OU

one	OO
is	OO
that	OO
science	OO
is	OO
just	OO
a	OO
big	OO
old	OO

of	OO
facts	.O
but	OU
that's	OO
not	OO

that's	OO
not	OO
even	OO
the	OO

of	OO

science	OU

a	OO

it's	OU
a	OO

it	,O

it's	OO

the	OO

the	OU

of	OO
science	OO
is	OO
to	OO
understand	OO

the	OO

we	OO

that's	OO

the	OU

that	OO

we	OU

we're	OO

good	OO
at	OO

ourselves	.O

this	OO

boiled	OO
down	OO
more	OO
than	OO
is	OO
probably	OO
useful	,O
here's	OO
how	OO
this	OO
works	.O
if	OU
you	OO
want	OO
to	OO
do	OO
some	OO
science	,O
what	OO
you	OO
want	OO
to	OO
do	OO
is	OO
you	OO
want	OO
to	OO
observe	OO
something	.O
say	,O
the	OU
sky	OO
is	OO
blue	.O
hey	,U
i	OU
wonder	OO
why	?O
you	OU
question	OO
it	.O
the	OU
next	OO
thing	OO
you	OO
do	OO
is	OO
you	OO
come	OO
up	OO
with	OO
an	OO
idea	OO
that	OO
may	OO
explain	OO
it:	OO
a	OO
hypothesis	.O
well	,U
you	OO
know	OO
what	?O
oceans	OU
are	OO
blue	.O
maybe	OU
the	OO
sky	OO
is	OO
reflecting	OO
the	OO
colors	OO
from	OO
the	OO
ocean	.O
great	,U
but	OO
now	OO
you	OO
have	OO
to	OO
test	OO
it	OO
so	OO
you	OO
predict	OO
what	OO
that	OO
might	OO
mean	.O
your	OU
prediction	OO
would	OO
be	,O
well	,U
if	OO
the	OO
sky	OO
is	OO
reflecting	OO
the	OO
ocean	OO
color	,O
it	OO
will	OO
be	OO
bluer	OO
on	OO
the	OO
coasts	OO
than	OO
it	OO
will	OO
be	OO
in	OO
the	OO
middle	OO
of	OO
the	OO
country	.O
ok	,U
that's	OO
fair	OO
enough	,O
but	OO
you've	OO
got	OO
to	OO
test	OO
that	OO
prediction	OO
so	OO
you	OO
get	OO
on	OO
a	OO
plane	,O
you	OO
leave	OO
denver	OU
on	OO
a	OO
nice	OO
gray	OO
day	,O
you	OO
fly	OO
to	OO
la	,U
you	OO
look	OO
up	OO
and	OO
the	OO
sky	OO
is	OO
gloriously	OO
blue	.O
hooray	,U
your	OO
thesis	OO
is	OO
proven	.O
but	OU
is	OO
it	OO
really	?O
no	.U
you've	OU
made	OO
one	OO
observation	.O
you	OU
need	OO
to	OO
think	OO
about	OO
your	OO
hypothesis	,O
think	OO
about	OO
how	OO
to	OO
test	OO
it	OO
and	OO
do	OO
more	OO
than	OO
just	OO
one	.O
maybe	OU
you	OO
could	OO
go	OO
to	OO
a	OO
different	OO
part	OO
of	OO
the	OO
country	OO
or	OO
a	OO
different	OO
part	OO
of	OO
the	OO
year	OO
and	OO
see	OO
what	OO
the	OO
weather's	OO
like	OO
then	.O
another	OU
good	OO
idea	OO
is	OO
to	OO
talk	OO
to	OO
other	OO
people	.O
they	OU
have	OO
different	OO
ideas	,O
different	OO
perspectives	,O
and	OO
they	OO
can	OO
help	OO
you	.O
this	OU
is	OO
what	OO
we	OO
call	OO
peer	OO
review	.O
and	OU
in	OO
fact	OO
that	OO
will	OO
probably	OO
also	OO
save	OO
you	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
money	OO
and	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
time	,O
flying	OO
coast	OO
to	OO
coast	OO
just	OO
to	OO
check	OO
the	OO
weather	.O
now	,U
what	OO
happens	OO
if	OO
your	OO
hypothesis	OO
does	OO
a	OO
decent	OO
job	OO
but	OO
not	OO
a	OO
perfect	OO
job	?O
well	,U
that's	OO
ok	,U
because	OO
what	OO
you	OO
can	OO
do	OO
is	OO
you	OO
can	OO
modify	OO
it	OO
a	OO
little	OO
bit	OO
and	OO
then	OO
go	OO
through	OO
this	OO
whole	OO
process	OO
again	OO
—	OO
make	OO
predictions	,O
test	OO
them	OO
—	OO
and	OO
as	OO
you	OO
do	OO
that	OO
over	OO
and	OO
over	OO
again	,O
you	OO
will	OO
hone	OO
this	OO
idea	.O
and	OU
if	OO
it	OO
gets	OO
good	OO
enough	,O
it	OO
may	OO
be	OO
accepted	OO
by	OO
the	OO
scientific	OO
community	,O
at	OO
least	OO
provisionally	,O
as	OO
a	OO
good	OO
explanation	OO
of	OO
what's	OO
going	OO
on	,O
at	OO
least	OO
until	OO
a	OO
better	OO
idea	OO
or	OO
some	OO
contradictory	OO
evidence	OO
comes	OO
along	.O
now	,U
part	OO
of	OO
this	OO
process	OO
is	OO
admitting	OO
when	OO
you're	OO
wrong	.O
and	OU
that	OO
can	OO
be	OO
really	,O
really	OO
hard	.O
science	OU
has	OO
its	OO
strengths	OO
and	OO
weaknesses	OO
and	OO
they	OO
depend	OO
on	OO
this	.O
one	OU
of	OO
the	OO
strengths	OO
of	OO
science	OO
is	OO
that	OO
it's	OO
done	OO
by	OO
people	,O
and	OO
it's	OO
proven	OO
itself	OO
to	OO
do	OO
a	OO
really	OO
good	OO
job	.O
we	OU
understand	OO
the	OO
universe	OO
pretty	OO
well	OO
because	OO
of	OO
science	.O
one	OU
of	OO
science's	OO
weaknesses	OO
is	OO
that	OO
it's	OO
done	OO
by	OO
people	,O
and	OO
we	OO
bring	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
baggage	OO
along	OO
with	OO
us	OO
when	OO
we	OO
investigate	OO
things	.O
we	OU
are	OO
egotistical	,O
we	OO
are	OO
stubborn	,O
we're	OO
superstitious	,O
we're	OO
tribal	,O
we're	OO
humans	OO
—	OO
these	OO
are	OO
all	OO
human	OO
traits	OO
and	OO
scientists	OO
are	OO
humans	.O
and	OU
so	OO
we	OO
have	OO
to	OO
be	OO
aware	OO
of	OO
that	OO
when	OO
we're	OO
studying	OO
science	OO
and	OO
when	OO
we're	OO
trying	OO
to	OO
develop	OO
our	OO
theses	.O
but	OU
part	OO
of	OO
this	OO
whole	OO
thing	,O
part	OO
of	OO
this	OO
scientific	OO
process	,O
part	OO
of	OO
the	OO
scientific	OO
method	,O
is	OO
admitting	OO
when	OO
you're	OO
wrong	.O
i	OU
know	,O
i've	OU
been	OO
there	.O
many	OU
years	OO
ago	OO
i	OU
was	OO
working	OO
on	OO
hubble	OU
space	OU
telescope	,U
and	OO
a	OO
scientist	OO
i	OU
worked	OO
with	OO
came	OO
to	OO
me	OO
with	OO
some	OO
data	,O
and	OO
he	OO
said	,O
i	OU
think	OO
there	OO
may	OO
be	OO
a	OO
picture	OO
of	OO
a	OO
planet	OO
orbiting	OO
another	OO
star	OO
in	OO
this	OO
data	.O
we	OU
had	OO
not	OO
had	OO
any	OO
pictures	OO
taken	OO
of	OO
planets	OO
orbiting	OO
other	OO
stars	OO
yet	,O
so	OO
if	OO
this	OO
were	OO
true	,O
then	OO
this	OO
would	OO
be	OO
the	OO
first	OO
one	OO
and	OO
we	OO
would	OO
be	OO
the	OO
ones	OO
who	OO
found	OO
it	.O
that's	OU
a	OO
big	OO
deal	.O
i	OU
was	OO
very	OO
excited	,O
so	OO
i	OU
just	OO
dug	OO
right	OO
into	OO
this	OO
data	.O
i	OU
spent	OO
a	OO
long	OO
time	OO
trying	OO
to	OO
figure	OO
out	OO
if	OO
this	OO
thing	OO
were	OO
a	OO
planet	OO
or	OO
not	.O
the	OU
problem	OO
is	OO
planets	OO
are	OO
faint	OO
and	OO
stars	OO
are	OO
bright	,O
so	OO
trying	OO
to	OO
get	OO
the	OO
signal	OO
out	OO
of	OO
this	OO
data	OO
was	OO
like	OO
trying	OO
to	OO
hear	OO
a	OO
whisper	OO
in	OO
a	OO
heavy	OO
metal	OO
concert	OO
—	OO
it	OO
was	OO
really	OO
hard	.O
i	OU
tried	OO
everything	OO
i	OU
could	,O
but	OO
after	OO
a	OO
month	OO
of	OO
working	OO
on	OO
this	,O
i	OU
came	OO
to	OO
a	OO
realization	.O
couldn't	OO
do	OO
it	.O
i	OU
had	OO
to	OO
give	OO
up	.O
and	OU
i	OU
had	OO
to	OO
tell	OO
this	OO
other	OO
scientist	,O
the	OU
data's	OO
too	OO
messy	.O
we	OU
can't	OO
say	OO
whether	OO
this	OO
is	OO
a	OO
planet	OO
or	OO
not	.O
and	OU
that	OO
was	OO
hard	.O
then	OU
later	OO
on	OO
we	OO
got	OO
follow	OO
up	OO
observations	OO
with	OO
hubble	,U
and	OO
it	OO
showed	OO
that	OO
it	OO
wasn't	OO
a	OO
planet	.O
it	OU
was	OO
a	OO
background	OO
star	OO
or	OO
galaxy	,O
something	OO
like	OO
that	.O
well	,U
not	OO
to	OO
get	OO
too	OO
technical	,O
but	OO
that	OO
sucked	.O
i	OU
was	OO
really	OO
unhappy	OO
about	OO
this	.O
but	OU
that's	OO
part	OO
of	OO
it	.O
you	OU
have	OO
to	OO
say	,O
look	,U
you	OO
know	,O
we	OO
can't	OO
do	OO
this	OO
with	OO
the	OO
data	OO
we	OO
have	.O
and	OU
then	OO
i	OU
had	OO
to	OO
face	OO
up	OO
to	OO
the	OO
fact	OO
that	OO
even	OO
the	OO
follow	OO
up	OO
data	OO
showed	OO
we	OO
were	OO
wrong	.O
emotionally	OU
i	OU
was	OO
pretty	OO
unhappy	.O
but	OU
if	OO
a	OO
scientist	OO
is	OO
doing	OO
their	OO
job	OO
correctly	,O
being	OO
wrong	OO
is	OO
not	OO
so	OO
bad	OO
because	OO
that	OO
means	OO
there's	OO
still	OO
more	OO
stuff	OO
out	OO
there	OO
—	OO
more	OO
things	OO
to	OO
figure	OO
out	.O
scientists	OU
don't	OO
love	OO
being	OO
wrong	OO
but	OO
we	OO
love	OO
puzzles	,O
and	OO
the	OO
universe	OO
is	OO
the	OO
biggest	OO
puzzle	OO
of	OO
them	OO
all	.O
now	OU
having	OO
said	OO
that	,O
if	OO
you	OO
have	OO
a	OO
piece	OO
and	OO
it	OO
doesn't	OO
fit	OO
no	OO
matter	OO
how	OO
you	OO
move	OO
it	,O
jamming	OO
it	OO
in	OO
harder	OO
isn't	OO
going	OO
to	OO
help	.O
there's	OU
going	OO
to	OO
be	OO
a	OO
time	OO
when	OO
you	OO
have	OO
to	OO
let	OO
go	OO
of	OO
your	OO
idea	OO
if	OO
you	OO
want	OO
to	OO
understand	OO
the	OO
bigger	OO
picture	.O
the	OU
price	OO
of	OO
doing	OO
science	OO
is	OO
admitting	OO
when	OO
you're	OO
wrong	,O
but	OO
the	OO
payoff	OO
is	OO
the	OO
best	OO
there	OO
is:	OO
knowledge	OO
and	OO
understanding	.O
and	OU
i	OU
can	OO
give	OO
you	OO
a	OO
thousand	OO
examples	OO
of	OO
this	OO
in	OO
science	,O
but	OO
there's	OO
one	OO
i	OU
really	OO
like	.O
it	OU
has	OO
to	OO
do	OO
with	OO
astronomy	,O
and	OO
it	OO
was	OO
a	OO
question	OO
that	OO
had	OO
been	OO
plaguing	OO
astronomers	OO
literally	OO
for	OO
centuries	.O
when	OU
you	OO
look	OO
at	OO
the	OO
sun	,U
it	OO
seems	OO
special	.O
it	OU
is	OO
the	OO
brightest	OO
object	OO
in	OO
the	OO
sky	,O
but	OO
having	OO
studied	OO
astronomy	,O
physics	,O
chemistry	,O
thermodynamics	OO
for	OO
centuries	,O
we	OO
learned	OO
something	OO
very	OO
important	OO
about	OO
it	.O
it's	OU
not	OO
that	OO
special	.O
it's	OU
a	OO
star	OO
just	OO
like	OO
millions	OO
of	OO
other	OO
stars	.O
but	OU
that	OO
raises	OO
an	OO
interesting	OO
question	.O
if	OU
the	OO
sun	OU
is	OO
a	OO
star	OO
and	OO
the	OO
sun	OU
has	OO
planets	,O
do	OO
these	OO
other	OO
stars	OO
have	OO
planets	?O
well	,U
like	OO
i	OU
said	OO
with	OO
my	OO
own	OO
failure	OO
in	OO
the	OO
planet	OO
i	OU
was	OO
looking	OO
for	,O
finding	OO
them	OO
is	OO
super	OO
hard	,O
but	OO
scientists	OO
tend	OO
to	OO
be	OO
pretty	OO
clever	OO
people	OO
and	OO
they	OO
used	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
different	OO
techniques	OO
and	OO
started	OO
observing	OO
stars	.O
and	OU
over	OO
the	OO
decades	OO
they	OO
started	OO
finding	OO
some	OO
things	OO
that	OO
were	OO
pretty	OO
interesting	,O
right	OO
on	OO
the	OO
thin	,O
hairy	OO
edge	OO
of	OO
what	OO
they	OO
were	OO
able	OO
to	OO
detect	.O
but	OU
time	OO
and	OO
again	,O
it	OO
was	OO
shown	OO
to	OO
be	OO
wrong	.O
that	OU
all	OO
changed	OO
in	OO
1991	.O
a	OU
couple	OO
of	OO
astronomers	OO
—	OO
alexander	OU
lyne	OU
—	OO
andrew	OU
lyne	,U
pardon	OO
me	OO
—	OO
and	OO
matthew	OU
bailes	,U
had	OO
a	OO
huge	OO
announcement	.O
they	OU
had	OO
found	OO
a	OO
planet	OO
orbiting	OO
another	OO
star	.O
and	OU
not	OO
just	OO
any	OO
star	,O
but	OO
a	OO
pulsar	,O
and	OO
this	OO
is	OO
the	OO
remnant	OO
of	OO
a	OO
star	OO
that	OO
has	OO
previously	OO
exploded	.O
it's	OU
blasting	OO
out	OO
radiation	.O
this	OU
is	OO
the	OO
last	OO
place	OO
in	OO
the	OO
universe	OO
you	OO
would	OO
expect	OO
to	OO
find	OO
a	OO
planet	,O
but	OO
they	OO
had	OO
very	OO
methodically	OO
looked	OO
at	OO
this	OO
pulsar	,O
and	OO
they	OO
detected	OO
the	OO
gravitational	OO
tug	OO
of	OO
this	OO
planet	OO
as	OO
it	OO
orbited	OO
the	OO
pulsar	.O
it	OU
looked	OO
really	OO
good	.O
the	OU
first	OO
planet	OO
orbiting	OO
another	OO
star	OO
had	OO
been	OO
found	.O
except	OO
not	OO
so	OO
much	.O
after	OU
they	OO
made	OO
the	OO
announcement	,O
a	OO
bunch	OO
of	OO
other	OO
astronomers	OO
commented	OO
on	OO
it	,O
and	OO
so	OO
they	OO
went	OO
back	OO
and	OO
looked	OO
at	OO
their	OO
data	OO
and	OO
realized	OO
they	OO
had	OO
made	OO
a	OO
very	OO
embarrassing	OO
mistake	.O
they	OU
had	OO
not	OO
accounted	OO
for	OO
some	OO
very	OO
subtle	OO
characteristics	OO
of	OO
the	OO
earth's	OU
motion	OO
around	OO
the	OO
sun	,U
which	OO
affected	OO
how	OO
they	OO
measured	OO
this	OO
planet	OO
going	OO
around	OO
the	OO
pulsar	.O
and	OU
it	OO
turns	OO
out	OO
that	OO
when	OO
they	OO
did	OO
account	OO
for	OO
it	OO
correctly	,O
poof	OO
—	OO
their	OO
planet	OO
disappeared	.O
it	OU
wasn't	OO
real	.O
so	OU
andrew	OU
lyne	OU
had	OO
a	OO
very	OO
formidable	OO
task	.O
he	OU
had	OO
to	OO
admit	OO
this	.O
so	OU
in	OO
1992	OO
at	OO
the	OO
american	OU
astronomical	OU
society	OU
meeting	,O
which	OO
is	OO
one	OO
of	OO
the	OO
largest	OO
gatherings	OO
of	OO
astronomers	OO
on	OO
the	OO
planet	,O
he	OO
stood	OO
up	OO
and	OO
announced	OO
that	OO
he	OO
had	OO
made	OO
a	OO
mistake	OO
and	OO
that	OO
the	OO
planet	OO
did	OO
not	OO
exist	.O
and	OU
what	OO
happened	OO
next	OO
—	OO
oh	,O
i	OU
love	OO
this	OO
—	OO
what	OO
happened	OO
next	OO
was	OO
wonderful	.O
he	OU
got	OO
an	OO
ovation	.O
the	OU
astronomers	OO
weren't	OO
angry	OO
at	OO
him;	OO
they	OO
didn't	OO
want	OO
to	OO
chastise	OO
him	.O
they	OU
praised	OO
him	OO
for	OO
his	OO
honesty	OO
and	OO
his	OO
integrity	.O
i	OU
love	OO
that	.O
scientists	OU
are	OO
people	.O
and	OU
it	OO
gets	OO
better	.O
lyne	OU
steps	OO
off	OO
the	OO
podium	.O
the	OU
next	OO
guy	OO
to	OO
come	OO
up	OO
is	OO
a	OO
man	OO
named	OO
aleksander	OU
wolszczan	OU
he	OU
takes	OO
the	OO
microphone	OO
and	OO
says	,O
yeah	,U
so	OO
lyne's	OU
team	OO
didn't	OO
find	OO
a	OO
pulsar	OO
planet	,O
but	OO
my	OO
team	OO
found	OO
not	OO
just	OO
one	OO
but	OO
two	OO
planets	OO
orbiting	OO
a	OO
different	OO
pulsar	.O
we	OU
knew	OO
about	OO
the	OO
problem	OO
that	OO
lyne	OU
had	,O
we	OO
checked	OO
for	OO
it	,O
and	OO
yeah	,O
ours	OO
are	OO
real	.O
and	OU
it	OO
turns	OO
out	OO
he	OO
was	OO
right	.O
and	OU
in	OO
fact	,O
a	OO
few	OO
months	OO
later	,O
they	OO
found	OO
a	OO
third	OO
planet	OO
orbiting	OO
this	OO
pulsar	OO
and	OO
it	OO
was	OO
the	OO
first	OO
exoplanet	OO
system	OO
ever	OO
found	OO
—	OO
what	OO
we	OO
call	OO
alien	OO
worlds	OO
—	OO
exoplanets	.O
that	OU
to	OO
me	OO
is	OO
just	OO
wonderful	.O
at	OU
that	OO
point	OO
the	OO
floodgates	OO
were	OO
opened	.O
in	OU
1995	OO
a	OO
planet	OO
was	OO
found	OO
around	OO
a	OO
star	OO
more	OO
like	OO
the	OO
sun	,U
and	OO
then	OO
we	OO
found	OO
another	OO
and	OO
another	.O
this	OU
is	OO
an	OO
image	OO
of	OO
an	OO
actual	OO
planet	OO
orbiting	OO
an	OO
actual	OO
star	.O
we	OU
kept	OO
getting	OO
better	OO
at	OO
it	.O
we	OU
started	OO
finding	OO
them	OO
by	OO
the	OO
bucketload	.O
we	OU
started	OO
finding	OO
thousands	OO
of	OO
them	.O
we	OU
built	OO
observatories	OO
specifically	OO
designed	OO
to	OO
look	OO
for	OO
them	.O
and	OU
now	OO
we	OO
know	OO
of	OO
thousands	OO
of	OO
them	.O
we	OU
even	OO
know	OO
of	OO
planetary	OO
systems	.O
that	OU
is	OO
actual	OO
data	,O
animated	,O
showing	OO
four	OO
planets	OO
orbiting	OO
another	OO
star	.O
this	OU
is	OO
incredible	.O
think	OU
about	OO
that	.O
for	OU
all	OO
of	OO
human	OO
history	,O
you	OO
could	OO
count	OO
all	OO
the	OO
known	OO
planets	OO
in	OO
the	OO
universe	OO
on	OO
two	OO
hands	OO
—	OO
nine	OO
—	OO
eight	?O
nine	?U
eight	OU
—	OO
eight	.O
eh	.U
but	OU
now	OO
we	OO
know	OO
they're	OO
everywhere	.O
every	OU
star	OO
—	OO
for	OO
every	OO
star	OO
you	OO
see	OO
in	OO
the	OO

there	OO
could	OO
be	OO
three	,O
five	,O
ten	OO
planets	.O
the	OU
sky	OO
is	OO
filled	OO
with	OO
them	.O
we	OU
think	OO
that	OO
planets	OO
may	OO
outnumber	OO
stars	OO
in	OO
the	OO
galaxy	.O
this	OU
is	OO
a	OO
profound	OO
statement	,O
and	OO
it	OO
was	OO
made	OO
because	OO
of	OO
science	.O
and	OU
it	OO
wasn't	OO
made	OO
just	OO
because	OO
of	OO
science	OO
and	OO
the	OO
observatories	OO
and	OO
the	OO
data;	OO
it	OO
was	OO
made	OO
because	OO

the	OO

the	OO

who	OO
took	OO
the	OO
data	,O
who	OO
made	OO
the	OO

then	OO
let	OO

that	OO

what	OO

a	OO

about	OO
the	OO

it	OO
always	OO

stuck	OO
with	OO

he	OU
argues	OO
that	OO
the	OO

color	OO
of	OO

red	,O
and	OO
that	OO
in	OO

all	OO

that	OO
it's	OO
red	OO
but	OO
the	OO

that	OO

imagine	OO
are	OO
as	OO

the	OO

if	OO

for	OO

the	OO

hay	OO

gone	,O
causing	OO
global	OO

economic	OO

a	OO
total	OO
moral	OO
crisis	OO
across	OO

now	,U
i	OU
first	OO
started	OO
keeping	OO
bees	OO
here	OO
in	OO
cape	OU
cod	OU
right	OO
after	OO
i	OU
finished	OO
my	OO
doctorate	OO
in	OO
honeybee	OO
immunology	.O
imagine	OU
getting	OO
such	OO
a	OO
degree	OO
in	OO
a	OO
good	OO

—	OO
and	OO
it	OO
was	OO
2009:	OO
the	OO

and	OU
i	OU
was	OO
onto	OO
something	.O
i	OU
knew	OO
that	OO
i	OU
could	OO
find	OO
out	OO
how	OO
to	OO
improve	OO

and	OU
so	OO
the	OO
community	OO
on	OO
cape	OU

here	OO
in	OO
provincetown	OU
was	OO
ripe	OO
for	OO
citizen	OO

people	OO
looking	OO
for	OO
ways	OO
to	OO
get	OO
involved	OO
and	OO
to	OO

and	OU
so	OO
we	OO
met	OO
with	OO
people	OO
in	OO
coffee	OO
shops	.O
a	OU
wonderful	OO
woman	OO
named	OO
natalie	OU
got	OO
eight	OO
beehives	OO
at	OO
her	OO
home	OO
in	OO
truro	,U
and	OO
she	OO
introduced	OO
us	OO
to	OO
her	OO
friend	OO
valerie	,U
who	OO
let	OO
us	OO
set	OO
up	OO
60	OO
beehives	OO
at	OO
an	OO
abandoned	OO
tennis	OO
court	OO
on	OO
her	OO
property	.O
and	OU
so	OO
we	OO
started	OO
testing	OO
vaccines	OO
for	OO
bees	.O
we	OU
were	OO
starting	OO
to	OO
look	OO
at	OO
probiotics	.O
we	OU
called	OO
it	OO
bee	OO
yogurt	OO
—	OO
ways	OO
to	OO
make	OO
bees	OO
healthier	.O
and	OU
our	OO
citizen	OO

project	OO
started	OO
to	OO
take	OO
off	.O
meanwhile	,U
back	OO
in	OO
my	OO
apartment	OO
here	,O
i	OU
was	OO
a	OO
bit	OO
nervous	OO
about	OO
my	OO
landlord	.O
i	OU
figured	OO
i	OU
should	OO
tell	OO
him	OO
what	OO
we	OO
were	OO
doing	.O
i	OU
was	OO
terrified;	OO
i	OU
really	OO
thought	OO
i	OU
was	OO
going	OO
to	OO
get	OO
an	OO
eviction	OO
notice	,O
which	OO
really	OO
was	OO
the	OO
last	OO
thing	OO
we	OO
needed	,O
right	?O
i	OU
must	OO
have	OO
caught	OO
him	OO
on	OO
a	OO
good	OO
day	,O
though	,O
because	OO
when	OO
i	OU
told	OO
him	OO
what	OO
we	OO
were	OO
doing	OO
and	OO
how	OO
we	OO
started	OO
our	OO
nonprofit	OO
urban	OO
beekeeping	OO
laboratory	,O
he	OO
said	,O
that's	OU
great	.O
let's	OU
get	OO
a	OO
beehive	OO
in	OO
the	OO
back	OO
alley	.O
i	OU
was	OO
shocked	.O
i	OU
was	OO
completely	OO
surprised	.O
i	OU
mean	,O
instead	OO
of	OO
getting	OO
an	OO
eviction	OO
notice	,O
we	OO
got	OO
another	OO
data	OO
point	.O
and	OU
in	OO
the	OO
back	OO
alley	OO
of	OO
this	OO
image	,O
what	OO
you	OO
see	OO
here	,O
this	OO
hidden	OO
beehive	OO
—	OO
that	OO
beehive	OO
produced	OO
more	OO
honey	OO
that	OO
first	OO
year	OO
than	OO
we	OO
have	OO
ever	OO
experienced	OO
in	OO
any	OO
beehive	OO
we	OO
had	OO
managed	.O
it	OU
shifted	OO
our	OO
research	OO
perspective	OO
forever	.O
it	OU
changed	OO
our	OO
research	OO
question	OO
away	OO
from	OO
how	OU
do	OO
we	OO
save	OO
the	OO
dead	OO
and	OO
dying	OO
bees	?O
to	OO
where	OU
are	OO
bees	OO
doing	OO
best	?O
and	OU
we	OO
started	OO
to	OO
be	OO
able	OO
to	OO
put	OO
maps	OO
together	,O
looking	OO
at	OO
all	OO
of	OO
these	OO
citizen	OO
science	OO
beehives	OO
from	OO
people	OO
who	OO
had	OO
beehives	OO
at	OO
home	OO

gardens	,O
business	OO
rooftops	.O
we	OU
started	OO
to	OO
engage	OO
the	OO
public	,O
and	OO
the	OO
more	OO
people	OO
who	OO
got	OO
these	OO

the	OO
more	OO

our	OO

and	OU
so	OO
when	OO
you're	OO
sitting	OO
here	OO
thinking	,O
how	OU
can	OO
i	OU
get	OO
involved	?O
you	OO
might	OO

about	OO
a	OO

of	OO
my	OO

fred	,U
who's	OO
a	OO
commercial	OO
real	OO

he	OU
was	OO

the	OO

he	OU

at	OO

about	OO
what	OO
he	OO
could	OO
do	OO
for	OO

at	OO

and	OU
while	OO
he	OO
was	OO
having	OO
a	OO
tea	OO
break	,O
he	OO
put	OO
honey	OO
into	OO
his	OO

and	OO
noticed	OO
on	OO
the	OO

a	OO
message	OO
about	OO
corporate	OO
sustainability	OO
from	OO
the	OO
host	OO
company	OO
of	OO
that	OO
meeting	.O
and	OU
it	OO

an	OO
idea	.O
he	OU
came	OO
back	OO
to	OO
his	OO
office	.O
an	OU
email	,O
a	OO
phone	OO
call	OO
later	,O
and	OO
—	OO
boom	.O
—	OO
we	OO
went	OO
national	OO
together	.O
we	OU
put	OO
dozens	OO
of	OO
beehives	OO
on	OO
the	OO
rooftops	OO
of	OO
their	OO
skyscrapers	OO
across	OO
nine	OO
cities	OO
nationwide	.O
nine	OU
years	OO
later	OO
—	OO
nine	OU
years	OO
later	,O
we	OO
have	OO
raised	OO
over	OO
a	OO
million	OO
dollars	OO
for	OO
bee	OO
research	.O
we	OU
have	OO
a	OO
thousand	OO
beehives	OO
as	OO
little	OO
data	OO
points	OO
across	OO
the	OO
country	,O
18	OO
states	OO
and	OO
counting	,O
where	OO
we	OO
have	OO
created	OO
paying	OO
jobs	OO
for	OO
local	OO
beekeepers	,O
65	OO
of	OO
them	,O
to	OO
manage	OO
beehives	OO
in	OO
their	OO
own	OO
communities	,O
to	OO
connect	OO
with	OO
people	,O
everyday	OO
people	,O
who	OO
are	OO
now	OO
data	OO
points	OO
together	OO
making	OO
a	OO
difference	.O
so	OU
in	OO
order	OO
to	OO
explain	OO
what's	OO
actually	OO
been	OO
saving	OO
bees	,O
where	OO
they're	OO
thriving	,O
i	OU
need	OO
to	OO
first	OO
tell	OO
you	OO
what's	OO
been	OO
killing	OO
them	.O
the	OU
top	OO
three	OO
killers	OO
of	OO
bees	OO
are	OO
agricultural	OO
chemicals	OO
such	OO
as	OO
pesticides	,O
herbicides	,O
fungicides;	OO
diseases	OO
of	OO
bees	,O
of	OO
which	OO
there	OO
are	OO
many;	OO
and	OO
habitat	OO
loss	.O
so	OU
what	OO
we	OO
did	OO
is	OO
we	OO
looked	OO
on	OO
our	OO
maps	OO
and	OO
we	OO
identified	OO
areas	OO
where	OO
bees	OO
were	OO
thriving	.O
this	OU
was	OO
mostly	OO
in	OO
cities	,O
we	OO
found	.O
data	OU
are	OO
now	OO
showing	OO
that	OO
urban	OO
beehives	OO
produce	OO
more	OO
honey	OO
than	OO
rural	OO
beehives	OO
and	OO
suburban	OO
beehives	.O
urban	OU
beehives	OO
have	OO
a	OO
longer	OO
life	OO
span	OO
than	OO
rural	OO
and	OO
suburban	OO
beehives	,O
and	OO
bees	OO
in	OO
the	OO
city	OO
are	OO
more	OO
biodiverse;	OO
there	OO
are	OO
more	OO
bee	OO
species	OO
in	OO
urban	OO
areas	.O
right	?U
why	OU
is	OO
this	?O
that	OU
was	OO
our	OO
question	.O
so	OU
we	OO
started	OO
with	OO
these	OO
three	OO
killers	OO
of	OO
bees	,O
and	OO
we	OO
flipped	OO
it:	OO
which	OU
of	OO
these	OO
is	OO
different	OO
in	OO
the	OO
cities	?O
so	OU
the	OO
first	OO
one	,O
pesticides	.O
we	OU
partnered	OO
up	OO
with	OO
the	OO
harvard	OU
school	OU
of	OO
public	OU
health	.U
we	OU
shared	OO
our	OO
data	OO
with	OO
them	.O
we	OU
collected	OO
samples	OO
from	OO
our	OO
citizen	OO
science	OO
beehives	OO
at	OO
people's	OO
homes	OO
and	OO
business	OO
rooftops	.O
we	OU
looked	OO
at	OO
pesticide	OO
levels	.O
we	OU
thought	OO
there	OO
would	OO
be	OO
less	OO
pesticides	OO
in	OO
areas	OO
where	OO
bees	OO
are	OO
doing	OO
better	.O
that's	OU
not	OO
the	OO
case	.O
so	OU
what	OO
we	OO
found	OO
here	OO
in	OO
our	OO
study	OO
is	OO
—	OO
the	OO
orange	OO
bars	OO
are	OO
boston	,U
and	OO
we	OO
thought	OO
those	OO
bars	OO
would	OO
be	OO
the	OO
lowest	,O
there	OO
would	OO
be	OO
the	OO
lowest	OO
levels	OO
of	OO
pesticides	.O
and	,U
in	OO
fact	,O
there	OO
are	OO
the	OO
most	OO
pesticides	OO
in	OO
cities	.O
so	OU
the	OO
pesticide	OO
hypothesis	OO
for	OO
what's	OO
saving	OO
bees	OO
—	OO
less	OO
pesticides	OO
in	OO
cities	OO
—	OO
is	OO
not	OO
it	.O
and	OU
this	OO
is	OO
very	OO
typical	OO
of	OO
my	OO
life	OO
as	OO
a	OO
scientist	.O
anytime	OU
i've	OU
had	OO
a	OO
hypothesis	,O
not	OO
only	OO
is	OO
it	OO
not	OO
supported	,O
but	OO
the	OO
opposite	OO
is	OO
true	.O
which	OU
is	OO
still	OO
an	OO
interesting	OO
finding	,O
right	?O
we	OU
moved	OO
on	.O
the	OU
disease	OO
hypothesis	.O
we	OU
looked	OO
at	OO
diseases	OO
all	OO
over	OO
our	OO
beehives	.O
and	OU
what	OO
we	OO
found	OO
in	OO
a	OO
similar	OO
study	OO
to	OO
this	OO
one	OO
with	OO
north	OU
carolina	OU
state	OU
is:	OO
there's	OO
no	OO
difference	OO
between	OO
disease	OO
in	OO
bees	OO
in	OO
urban	,O
suburban	OO
and	OO
rural	OO
areas	.O
diseases	OU
are	OO
everywhere;	OO
bees	OO
are	OO
sick	OO
and	OO
dying	.O
in	OU
fact	,O
there	OO
were	OO
more	OO
diseases	OO
of	OO
bees	OO
in	OO
cities	.O
this	OU
was	OO
from	OO
raleigh	,U
north	OU
carolina	.U
so	OU
again	,O
my	OO
hypothesis	OO
was	OO
not	OO
supported	.O
the	OU
opposite	OO
was	OO
true	.O
we're	OU
moving	OO
on	.O
the	OU
habitat	OO
hypothesis	.O
this	OU
said	OO
that	OO
areas	OO
where	OO
bees	OO
are	OO
thriving	OO
have	OO
a	OO
better	OO
habitat	OO
—	OO
more	OO
flowers	,O
right	?O
but	OU
we	OO
didn't	OO
know	OO
how	OO
to	OO
test	OO
this	.O
so	OU
i	OU
had	OO
a	OO
really	OO
interesting	OO
meeting	.O
an	OU
idea	OO
sparked	OO
with	OO
my	OO
friend	OO
and	OO
colleague	OO
anne	OU
madden	,U
fellow	OO
ted	OU
speaker	.O
we	OU
thought	OO
about	OO
genomics	,O
kind	OO
of	OO
like	OO
ancestrydna	OU
or	OO
23andme	.O
have	OU
you	OO
done	OO
these	?O
you	OU
spit	OO
in	OO
a	OO
tube	OO
and	OO
you	OO
find	OO
out	,O
i'm	OU
german	.U
well	,U
we	OO
developed	OO
this	OO
for	OO
honey	.O
so	OU
we	OO
have	OO
a	OO
sample	OO
of	OO
honey	OO
and	OO
we	OO
look	OO
at	OO
all	OO
the	OO
plant	OO
dna	,U
and	OO
we	OO
find	OO
out	,O
i'm	OU
sumac	.O
and	OU
that's	OO
what	OO
we	OO
found	OO
here	OO
in	OO
provincetown	.U
so	OU
for	OO
the	OO
first	OO
time	OO
ever	,O
i'm	OU
able	OO
to	OO
report	OO
to	OO
you	OO
what	OO
type	OO
of	OO
honey	OO
is	OO
from	OO
right	OO
here	OO
in	OO
our	OO
own	OO
community	.O
honeydna	,U
a	OO
genomics	OO
test	.O
spring	OU
honey	OO
in	OO
provincetown	OU
is	OO
from	OO
privet	.O
what's	OU
privet	?O
hedges	.U
what's	OU
the	OO
message	?O
don't	OU
trim	OO
your	OO
hedges	OO
to	OO
save	OO
the	OO
bees	.O
i	OU
know	OO
we're	OO
getting	OO
crunchy	OO
and	OO
it's	OO
controversial	,O
so	OO
before	OO
you	OO
throw	OO
your	OO

we'll	OO
move	OO
to	OO
the	OO
summer	OO
honey	,O
which	OO
is	OO
water	OO
lily	OO
honey	.O
if	OU
you	OO
have	OO
honey	OO
from	OO
provincetown	OU
right	OO
here	OO
in	OO
the	OO
summer	,O
you're	OO
eating	OO
water	OO

in	OO
the	OO

sumac	OO
honey	.O
we're	OU
learning	OO
about	OO
our	OO

for	OO
the	OO
first	OO

ever	.O
and	OU
now	OO
we're	OO
able	OO
to	OO
report	,O
if	OO
you	OO
need	OO
to	OO
do	OO
any	OO
city	OO
planning:	OO
what	OU
are	OO
good	OO
things	OO
to	OO

what	OU

we	OO

the	OO

to	OO
that's	OO

for	OO

for	OU
the	OO

ever	OO
for	OO
any	OO

we	OO
now	OO

this	OO
answer	.O
what's	OU
more	OO
interesting	OO
for	OO
us	OO
is	OO
deeper	OO
in	OO
the	OO

so	,U
if	OO
you're	OO

from	OO
the	OO

but	OU
what's	OO

is	OO
85	OO

in	OO

austen’s	OU

these	OO

doubly	OO
surprising	,O
blindsiding	OO
both	OO

but	OU
rather	OO
than	OO
diminishing	OO
her	OO
host	OO

these	OO

only	OO
confirm	OO
“the	OO

their	OU

also	OO

help	OO
them	OO
deal	OO
with	OO
and	OO
manage	OO
their	OO
own	OO
emotions	.O
and	OU
in	OO
doing	OO
that	,O
we	OO
were	OO
able	OO
to	OO
move	OO
our	OO
school	OO
from	OO
one	OO
of	OO
the	OO
lowest	OO
performing	OO
schools	OO
in	OO
the	OO
state	OO
of	OO
ohio	,U
with	OO
an	OO
f	OU
rating	,O
all	OO
the	OO
way	OO
up	OO
to	OO
a	OO
c	OU
in	OO
just	OO
a	OO
matter	OO
of	OO
a	OO
few	OO
years	.O
so	OU
it	OO
might	OO
sound	OO
obvious	,O
right	?O
of	OU
course	OO
teachers	OO
should	OO
be	OO
focused	OO
on	OO
the	OO
emotional	OO
well	OO
being	OO
of	OO
their	OO
kids	.O
but	OU
in	OO
reality	,O
when	OO
you're	OO
in	OO
a	OO
classroom	OO
full	OO
of	OO
30	OO
students	OO
and	OO
one	OO
of	OO
them's	OO
throwing	OO
tables	OO
at	OO
you	,O
it's	OO
far	OO
easier	OO
to	OO
exclude	OO
that	OO
child	OO
than	OO
to	OO
figure	OO
out	OO
what's	OO
going	OO
on	OO
inside	OO
of	OO
his	OO
head	.O
but	OU
what	OO
we	OO
learned	OO
about	OO
d	,U
and	OO
for	OO
kids	OO
like	OO
d	,U
was	OO
that	OO
small	OO
changes	OO
can	OO
make	OO
huge	OO
differences	,O
and	OO
it's	OO
possible	OO
to	OO
start	OO
right	OO
now	.O
you	OU
don't	OO
need	OO
bigger	OO
budgets	OO
or	OO
grand	OO
strategic	OO
plans	,O
you	OO
simply	OO
need	OO
smarter	OO
ways	OO
of	OO
thinking	OO
about	OO
what	OO
you	OO
have	OO
and	OO
where	OO
you	OO
have	OO
it	.O
in	OU
education	,O
we	OO
tend	OO
to	OO
always	OO
look	OO
outside	OO
the	OO
box	OO
for	OO
answers	,O
and	OO
we	OO
rarely	OO
spend	OO
enough	OO
time	,O
money	OO
and	OO
effort	OO
developing	OO
what	OO
we	OO
already	OO
have	OO
inside	OO
the	OO
box	.O
and	OU
this	OO
is	OO
how	OO
meaningful	OO
change	OO
can	OO
happen	OO
fast	.O
so	OU
here's	OO
what	OO
i	OU
learned	OO
about	OO
d	.U
i	OU
was	OO
wanting	OO
to	OO
dig	OO
a	OO
little	OO
bit	OO
deeper	OO
to	OO
figure	OO
out	OO
how	OO
he	OO
had	OO
become	OO
so	OO
angry	.O
and	OU
what	OO
i	OU
learned	OO
was	OO
his	OO
father	OO
had	OO
left	OO
the	OO
home	OO
and	OO
his	OO
mother	OO
was	OO
working	OO
long	OO
shifts	OO
in	OO
order	OO
to	OO
support	OO
the	OO
family	,O
which	OO
left	OO
no	OO
adult	OO
for	OO
d	OU
to	OO
connect	OO
with	OO
—	OO
and	OO
he	OO
was	OO
in	OO
charge	OO
of	OO
taking	OO
care	OO
of	OO
his	OO
younger	OO
brother	OO
when	OO
he	OO
got	OO
home	OO
from	OO
school	.O
might	OU
i	OU
remind	OO
you	OO
that	OO
d	OU
was	OO
six	OO
years	OO
old	?O
can't	OU
say	OO
that	OO
i	OU
blame	OO
him	OO
for	OO
having	OO
some	OO
trouble	OO
transitioning	OO
into	OO
the	OO
school	OO
environment	.O
but	OU
yet	OO
we	OO
had	OO
to	OO
figure	OO
out	OO
a	OO
way	OO
to	OO
help	OO
him	OO
with	OO
these	OO
big	OO
emotions	OO
all	OO
while	OO
teaching	OO
him	OO
core	OO
skills	OO
of	OO
reading	OO
and	OO
math	.O
and	OU
three	OO
things	OO
helped	OO
us	OO
most	.O
first	,U
we	OO
had	OO
to	OO
figure	OO
out	OO
where	OO
he	OO
was	OO
struggling	OO
the	OO
most	.O
and	OU
like	OO
most	OO
young	OO
kids	,O
arrival	OO
at	OO
school	OO
can	OO
be	OO
a	OO
tough	OO
transition	OO
time	OO
as	OO
they're	OO
moving	OO
from	OO
a	OO
less	OO
structured	OO
home	OO
environment	OO
to	OO
a	OO
more	OO
structured	OO
school	OO
environment	.O
so	OU
what	OO
we	OO
did	OO
for	OO
d	OU
was	OO
we	OO
created	OO
a	OO
calming	OO
area	OO
for	OO
him	OO
in	OO
our	OO
time	OO
out	OO
room	,O
which	OO
we	OO
had	OO
equipped	OO
with	OO
rocking	OO
chairs	OO
and	OO
soft	OO
cushions	OO
and	OO
books	,O
and	OO
we	OO
allowed	OO
d	OU
to	OO
go	OO
to	OO
this	OO
place	OO
in	OO
the	OO
morning	,O
away	OO
from	OO
the	OO
other	OO
kids	,O
allowing	OO
him	OO
time	OO
to	OO
transition	OO
back	OO
into	OO
the	OO
school	OO
environment	OO
on	OO
his	OO
own	OO
terms	.O
and	OU
as	OO
we	OO
began	OO
to	OO
learn	OO
more	OO
about	OO
d	,U
we	OO
learned	OO
other	OO
strategies	OO
that	OO
helped	OO
him	OO
calm	OO
down	.O
for	OU
example	,O
d	OU
loved	OO
to	OO
help	OO
younger	OO
students	,O
so	OO
we	OO
made	OO
him	OO
a	OO
kindergarten	OO
helper	,O
and	OO
he	OO
went	OO
into	OO
the	OO
kindergarten	OO
classroom	OO
and	OO
taught	OO
students	OO
how	OO
to	OO
write	OO
their	OO
letters	.O
and	OU
he	OO
was	OO
actually	OO
successful	OO
with	OO
a	OO
few	OO
of	OO
them	OO
that	OO
the	OO
teacher	OO
was	OO
unable	OO
to	OO
reach	.O
and	OU
believe	OO
it	OO
or	OO
not	,O
d	OU
actually	OO
helped	OO
calm	OO
some	OO
of	OO
those	OO
kindergarten	OO
students	OO
down	,O
signalling	OO
to	OO
us	OO
that	OO
the	OO
influence	OO
of	OO
peers	OO
on	OO
behavior	OO
was	OO
far	OO
greater	OO
than	OO
anything	OO
we	OO
adults	OO
could	OO
ever	OO
do	.O
we	OU
used	OO
humor	OO
and	OO
song	OO
with	OO
him	.O
yes	,U
i	OU
know	OO
it	OO
sounds	OO
really	OO
silly	OO
that	OO
the	OO
principal	OO
and	OO
the	OO
teachers	OO
would	OO
actually	OO
laugh	OO
with	OO
kids	,O
but	OO
you	OO
can	OO
imagine	OO
the	OO
shock	OO
on	OO
d's	OU
face	OO
when	OO
the	OO
principal's	OO
cracking	OO
a	OO
joke	OO
or	OO
singing	OO
a	OO
song	OO
from	OO
the	OO
radio	OO
station	,O
which	OO
almost	OO
always	OO
ended	OO
in	OO
a	OO
laugh	,O
shortening	OO
the	OO
length	OO
of	OO
his	OO
outburst	OO
and	OO
helping	OO
us	OO
to	OO
connect	OO
with	OO
him	OO
in	OO
his	OO
world	.O
so	OU
i	OU
know	OO
some	OO
you	OO
are	OO
like	,O
it's	OU
really	OO
not	OO
practical	OO
to	OO
lay	OO
on	OO
this	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
special	OO
treatment	OO
for	OO
every	OO
student	,O
but	OO
we	OO
actually	OO
made	OO
it	OO
happen	.O
because	OU
once	OO
we	OO
figured	OO
out	OO
the	OO
tools	OO
and	OO
tactics	OO
that	OO
worked	OO
for	OO
d	,U
our	OO
teachers	OO
were	OO
able	OO
to	OO
roll	OO
that	OO
out	OO
and	OO
use	OO
them	OO
with	OO
other	OO
students	.O
we	OU
began	OO
to	OO
proactively	OO
address	OO
student	OO
behavior	OO
instead	OO
of	OO
simply	OO
react	OO
to	OO
it	.O
our	OU
teachers	OO
actually	OO
took	OO
time	OO
during	OO
the	OO
lesson	OO
plan	OO
to	OO
teach	OO
kids	OO
how	OO
to	OO
identify	OO
their	OO
feelings	OO
and	OO
appropriate	,O
healthy	OO
coping	OO
strategies	OO
for	OO
dealing	OO
with	OO
them	,O
such	OO
as	OO
counting	OO
to	OO
10	,O
grabbing	OO
a	OO
fidget	OO
spinner	OO
or	OO
taking	OO
a	OO
quick	OO
walk	.O
we	OU
incorporated	OO
brain	OO
breaks	OO
throughout	OO
the	OO
day	,O
allowing	OO
kids	OO
to	OO
sing	OO
songs	,O
do	OO
yoga	OO
poses	OO
and	OO
participate	OO
in	OO
structured	OO
physical	OO
activities	.O
and	OU
for	OO
those	OO
kids	OO
that	OO
struggle	OO
with	OO
sitting	OO
for	OO
long	OO
periods	OO
of	OO
time	,O
we	OO
invested	OO
in	OO
flexible	OO
seating	,O
such	OO
as	OO
rocking	OO
chairs	OO
and	OO
exercise	OO
bikes	,O
and	OO
even	OO
floor	OO
elliptical	OO
machines	,O
allowing	OO
kids	OO
to	OO
pedal	OO
underneath	OO
their	OO
desks	.O
these	OU
changes	OO
encouraged	OO
kids	OO
to	OO
stay	OO
in	OO
the	OO
classroom	,O
helping	OO
them	OO
to	OO
focus	OO
and	OO
learn	.O
and	OU
when	OO
less	OO
kids	OO
are	OO
disrupting	,O
all	OO
kids	OO
do	OO
better	.O
and	OU
here's	OO
the	OO
magical	OO
thing:	OO
it	OO
didn't	OO
cost	OO
us	OO
a	OO
whole	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
extra	OO
money	.O
we	OU
simply	OO
thought	OO
differently	OO
about	OO
what	OO
we	OO
had	.O
for	OU
example	,O
every	OO
public	OO
school	OO
has	OO
an	OO
instructional	OO
supply	OO
line	.O
an	OU
instructional	OO
supply	OO
could	OO
be	OO
a	OO
book	,O
it	OO
could	OO
be	OO
a	OO
whiteboard	,O
it	OO
could	OO
be	OO
flexible	OO
seating	,O
it	OO
could	OO
be	OO
a	OO
fidget	OO
spinner	,O
it	OO
could	OO
even	OO
be	OO
painting	OO
the	OO
walls	OO
of	OO
a	OO
school	OO
a	OO
more	OO
calming	OO
color	,O
allowing	OO
students	OO
to	OO
thrive	.O
it's	OU
not	OO
that	OO
we	OO
didn't	OO
invest	OO
in	OO
the	OO
academic	OO
tools	OO
—	OO
obviously	OO
—	OO
but	OO
we	OO
took	OO
the	OO
social	OO
tools	OO
seriously	,O
too	.O
and	OU
the	OO
results	OO
speak	OO
for	OO
themselves	.O
by	OU
taking	OO
the	OO
emotional	OO
development	OO
of	OO
our	OO
kids	OO
seriously	OO
and	OO
helping	OO
them	OO
manage	OO
their	OO
emotions	,O
we	OO
saw	OO
huge	OO
growth	OO
in	OO
our	OO
reading	OO
and	OO
math	OO
scores	,O
far	OO
exceeding	OO
the	OO
one	OO
year	OO
of	OO
expected	OO
growth	OO
and	OO
outscoring	OO
many	OO
schools	OO
with	OO
our	OO
same	OO
demographic	.O
the	OU
second	OO
thing	OO
we	OO
did	OO
to	OO
help	OO
our	OO
kids	OO
manage	OO
their	OO
emotions	OO
was	OO
we	OO
used	OO
leverage	.O
as	OU
a	OO
not	OO
so	OO
funded	OO
public	OO
school	,O
we	OO
didn't	OO
have	OO
the	OO
support	OO
staff	OO
to	OO
address	OO
the	OO
chaos	OO
that	OO
our	OO
kids	OO
might	OO
be	OO
facing	OO
at	OO
home	,O
and	OO
we	OO
certainly	OO
weren't	OO
trained	OO
or	OO
funded	OO
to	OO
address	OO
it	OO
directly	.O
so	OU
we	OO
started	OO
to	OO
reach	OO
out	OO
to	OO
local	OO
groups	,O
community	OO
agencies	,O
and	OO
even	OO
the	OO
ohio	OU
state	OU
university	.U
our	OU
partnership	OO
with	OO
the	OO
ohio	OU
state	OU
university	OU
afforded	OO
us	OO
college	OO
students	OO
not	OO
only	OO
studying	OO
education	OO
but	OO
also	OO
school	OO
psychology	OO
and	OO
school	OO
social	OO
work	.O
these	OU
students	OO
were	OO
paired	OO
with	OO
our	OO
teachers	OO
to	OO
help	OO
our	OO
most	OO
struggling	OO
students	.O
and	OU
everyone	OO
benefitted	OO
because	OO
our	OO
teachers	OO
got	OO
access	OO
to	OO
the	OO
latest	OO
college	OO
level	OO
thinking	,O
and	OO
those	OO
college	OO
students	OO
got	OO
real	OO

life	OO
experiences	OO
in	OO
the	OO
classroom	.O
our	OU
partnership	OO
with	OO
our	OO
local	OO
nationwide	OU
children's	OU
hospital	OU
afforded	OO
us	OO
—	OO
they're	OO
building	OO
us	OO
a	OO
health	OO
clinic	OO
within	OO
our	OO
school	,O
providing	OO
health	OO
and	OO
mental	OO
health	OO
resources	OO
for	OO
our	OO
students	.O
and	OU
our	OO
kids	OO
benefitted	OO
from	OO
this	,O
too	.O
our	OU
absences	OO
continued	OO
to	OO
go	OO
down	,O
and	OO
our	OO
kids	OO
had	OO
access	OO
to	OO
counseling	OO
that	OO
they	OO
could	OO
access	OO
during	OO
the	OO
school	OO
day	.O
and	OU
perhaps	OO
the	OO
biggest	OO
change	OO
was	OO
not	OO
in	OO
d	OU
or	OO
in	OO
the	OO
kids	OO
at	OO
all	.O
it	OU
was	OO
in	OO
the	OO
adults	OO
in	OO
the	OO
room	.O
teachers	OU
are	OO
typically	OO
good	OO
at	OO
planning	OO
for	OO
and	OO
delivering	OO
academic	OO
instruction	,O
but	OO
when	OO
you	OO
throw	OO
in	OO
disruptive	OO
behavior	,O
it	OO
can	OO
feel	OO
completely	OO
outside	OO
the	OO
scope	OO
of	OO
the	OO
job	.O
but	OU
by	OO
us	OO
taking	OO
the	OO
emotional	OO
development	OO
of	OO
our	OO
kids	OO
seriously	,O
we	OO
moved	OO
from	OO
a	OO
philosophy	OO
of	OO
exclusion	OO
—	OO
you	OO
disrupt	,O
get	OO
out	OO
—	OO
to	OO
one	OO
of	OO
trust	OO
and	OO
respect	.O
it	OU
wasn't	OO
easy	,O
but	OO
we	OO
felt	OO
at	OO
heart	,O
it	OO
was	OO
a	OO
positive	OO
way	OO
to	OO
make	OO
change	,O
and	OO
i'm	OU
in	OO
awe	OO
at	OO
the	OO
teachers	OO
that	OO
took	OO
that	OO
leap	OO
with	OO
me	.O
as	OU
part	OO
of	OO
our	OO
personal	OO
professional	OO
development	OO
plan	,O
we	OO
studied	OO
the	OO
research	OO
of	OO
dr	.U
bruce	OU
perry	OU
and	OO
his	OO
research	OO
on	OO
the	OO
effects	OO
of	OO
different	OO
childhood	OO
experiences	OO
on	OO
the	OO
developing	OO
child's	OO
brain	.O
and	OU
what	OO
we	OO
learned	OO
was	OO
that	OO
some	OO
of	OO
our	OO
students'	OO
experiences	,O
such	OO
as	OO
an	OO
absent	OO
parent	,O
chaotic	OO
home	OO
life	,O
poverty	OO
and	OO
illness	,O
create	OO
real	OO
trauma	OO
on	OO
developing	OO
brains	.O
yes	,U
trauma	.O
i	OU
know	OO
it's	OO
a	OO
very	OO
strong	OO
word	,O
but	OO
it	OO
helped	OO
us	OO
to	OO
reframe	OO
and	OO
understand	OO
the	OO
behaviors	OO
that	OO
we	OO
were	OO
seeing	.O
and	OU
those	OO
difficult	OO
home	OO
experiences	OO
created	OO
real	OO
barbed	OO
wire	OO
barriers	OO
to	OO
learning	,O
and	OO
we	OO
had	OO
to	OO
figure	OO
out	OO
a	OO
way	OO
over	OO
it	.O
so	OU
our	OO
teachers	OO
continued	OO
to	OO
practice	OO
with	OO
lesson	OO
plans	,O
doing	OO
shorter	OO
lesson	OO
plans	OO
with	OO
a	OO
single	OO
focus	,O
allowing	OO
kids	OO
to	OO
engage	,O
and	OO
continued	OO
to	OO
incorporate	OO
these	OO
movement	OO
breaks	,O
allowing	OO
kids	OO
to	OO
jump	OO
up	OO
and	OO
down	OO
in	OO
class	OO
and	OO
dance	OO
for	OO
two	OO
minutes	OO
straight	,O
because	OO
we	OO
learned	OO
that	OO
taking	OO
breaks	OO
helps	OO
the	OO
learner	OO
retain	OO
new	OO
information	.O
and	OU
might	OO
i	OU
add	OO
that	OO
the	OO
cha	OU
cha	OU
slide	OU
provides	OO
a	OO
perfect	OO
short	OO
dance	OO
party	.O
i	OU
saw	OO
teachers	OO
say	,O
what	OU
happened	OO
to	OO
you	?O
instead	OO
of	OO
what's	OU
wrong	OO
with	OO
you	?O
or	OO
how	OU
can	OO
i	OU
help	OO
you	?O
instead	OO
of	OO
get	OU
out	.O
and	OU
this	OO
investment	OO
in	OO
our	OO

made	OO
huge	OO

and	OO
we	OO
continue	OO
to	OO

in	OO
our	OO

i'm	OU
happy	OO
to	OO

that	OO
when	OO

he	OO
rarely	OO

into	OO
trouble	.O
he	OU
became	OO
a	OO

in	OO
the	OO

this	OO

i	OU

i	OU

to	OO

and	OU
it's	OO

the	OO

the	OU
time	OO

us	OO
to	OO

what	OO
we	OO

if	OU
we	OO

your	OU

you	OO

and	OO
you	OO

your	OO

it's	OU
official:	OO
you've	OO
got	OO
the	OO
flu	.O
it's	OU
logical	OO
to	OO
assume	OO
that	OO
this	OO

of	OO
symptoms	OO
is	OO
the	OO
result	OO
of	OO
the	OO
infection	OO
coursing	OO

but	OO
is	OO
that	OO
really	OO
the	OO
case	?O
what's	OU
actually	OO
making	OO
you	OO
feel	OO
sick	?O
what	OU
if	OO
your	OO
body	OO
itself	OO
was	OO
driving	OO
this	OO
vicious	OO
onslaught	?O
you	OU
first	OO
get	OO
ill	OO
when	OO
a	OO
pathogen	OO
like	OO
the	OO
flu	OO

gets	OO
into	OO
your	OO
system	,O
infecting	OO
and	OO
killing	OO
your	OO
cells	.O
but	OU
this	OO
unwelcome	OO
intrusion	OO
has	OO
another	OO
effect:	OO
it	OO
alerts	OO
your	OO
body's	OO
immune	OO
system	OO
to	OO
your	OO
plight	.O
as	OU
soon	OO
as	OO
it	OO
becomes	OO
aware	OO
of	OO
infection	,O
your	OO
body	OO
leaps	OO
to	OO
your	OO
defense	.O
cells	OU
called	OO
macrophages	OO
charge	OO
in	OO
as	OO
the	OO
first	OO
line	OO
of	OO
attack	,O
searching	OO
for	OO
and	OO
destroying	OO
the	OO
viruses	OO
and	OO
infected	OO
cells	.O
afterwards	,U
the	OO
macrophages	OO
release	OO
protein	OO
molecules	OO
called	OO
cytokines	OO
whose	OO
job	OO
is	OO
to	OO
recruit	OO
and	OO
organize	OO
more	OO
virus	OO
busting	OO
cells	OO
from	OO
your	OO

system	.O
if	OU
this	OO
coordinated	OO
effort	OO
is	OO
strong	OO
enough	,O
it'll	OO
wipe	OO
out	OO
the	OO
infection	OO
before	OO
you	OO
even	OO
notice	OO
it	.O
but	OU
that's	OO
just	OO
your	OO

the	OO

for	OO
some	OO

action	.O
in	OU
some	OO

to	OU
avoid	OO
this	OO
sometimes	OO
dangerous	OO
fate	,O
your	OO
immune	OO
system	OO
must	OO
launch	OO
a	OO
stronger	OO
attack	,O
coordinating	OO
its	OO
activity	OO
with	OO
the	OO
brain	.O
that's	OU
where	OO
those	OO
unpleasant	OO
symptoms	OO
come	OO
in	,O
starting	OO
with	OO
the	OO
surging	OO
temperature	,O
aches	OO
and	OO
pains	,O
and	OO
sleepiness	.O
so	OU
why	OO
do	OO
we	OO
experience	OO
this	?O
when	OU
the	OO
immune	OO
system	OO
is	OO
under	OO
serious	OO
attack	,O
it	OO
secretes	OO
more	OO
cytokines	,O
which	OO
trigger	OO
two	OO
responses	.O
first	,U
the	OO
vagus	OO
nerve	,O
which	OO
runs	OO
through	OO
the	OO
body	OO
into	OO
the	OO
brain	,O
quickly	OO
transmits	OO
the	OO
information	OO
to	OO
the	OO
brain	OO
stem	,O
passing	OO
near	OO
an	OO
important	OO
area	OO
of	OO
pain	OO
processing	.O
second	,U
cytokines	OO
travel	OO
through	OO
the	OO
body	OO
to	OO
the	OO
hypothalamus	,O
the	OO
part	OO
of	OO
the	OO
brain	OO
responsible	OO
for	OO
controlling	OO
temperature	,O
thirst	,O
hunger	,O
and	OO
sleep	,O
among	OO
other	OO
things	.O
when	OU
it	OO
receives	OO
this	OO
message	,O
the	OO
hypothalamus	OO
produces	OO
another	OO
molecule	OO
called	OO
prostaglandin	OO
e2	,U
which	OO
gears	OO
it	OO
up	OO
for	OO
war	.O
the	OU
hypothalamus	OO
sends	OO
signals	OO
that	OO
instruct	OO
your	OO
muscles	OO
to	OO
contract	OO
and	OO
causes	OO
a	OO
rise	OO
in	OO
body	OO
temperature	.O
it	OU
also	OO
makes	OO
you	OO
sleepy	,O
and	OO
you	OO
lose	OO
your	OO
appetite	OO
and	OO
thirst	.O
but	OU
what's	OO
the	OO
point	OO
of	OO
all	OO
of	OO
these	OO
unpleasant	OO
symptoms	?O
well	,U
we're	OO
not	OO
yet	OO
sure	,O
but	OO
some	OO
theorize	OO
that	OO
they	OO
aid	OO
in	OO
recovery	.O
the	OU
rise	OO
in	OO
temperature	OO
can	OO
slow	OO
bacteria	OO
and	OO
help	OO
your	OO
immune	OO
system	OO
destroy	OO
pathogens	.O
sleep	OU
lets	OO
your	OO
body	OO
channel	OO
more	OO
energy	OO
towards	OO
fighting	OO
infection	.O
when	OU
you	OO
stop	OO
eating	,O
your	OO
liver	OO
can	OO
take	OO
up	OO
much	OO
of	OO
the	OO
iron	OO
in	OO
your	OO
blood	,O
and	OO
since	OO
iron	OO
is	OO
essential	OO
for	OO
bacterial	OO
survival	,O
that	OO
effectively	OO
starves	OO
them	.O
your	OU
reduced	OO
thirst	OO
makes	OO
you	OO
mildly	OO
dehydrated	,O
diminishing	OO
transmission	OO
through	OO
sneezes	,O
coughs	,O
vomit	,O
or	OO
diarrhea	.O
though	OU
it's	OO
worth	OO
noting	OO
that	OO
if	OO
you	OO
don't	OO
drink	OO
enough	OO
water	,O
that	OO
dehydration	OO
can	OO
become	OO
dangerous	.O
even	OU
the	OO
body's	OO
aches	OO
make	OO
you	OO
more	OO
sensitive	,O
drawing	OO
attention	OO
to	OO
infected	OO
cuts	OO
that	OO
might	OO
be	OO
worsening	,O
or	OO
even	OO
causing	OO
your	OO
condition	.O
in	OU
addition	OO
to	OO
physical	OO
symptoms	,O
sickness	OO
can	OO
also	OO
make	OO
you	OO
irritable	,O
sad	,O
and	OO
confused	.O
that's	OU
because	OO
cytokines	OO
and	OO
prostaglandin	OO
can	OO
reach	OO
even	OO
higher	OO
structures	OO
in	OO
your	OO
brain	,O
disrupting	OO
the	OO
activity	OO
of	OO
neurotransmitters	,O
like	OO
glutamate	,O
endorphins	,O
serotonin	,O
and	OO
dopamine	.O
this	OU
affects	OO
areas	OO
like	OO
the	OO
limbic	OO
system	,O
which	OO
oversees	OO
emotions	,O
and	OO
your	OO
cerebral	OO
cortex	,O
which	OO
is	OO
involved	OO
in	OO
reasoning	.O
so	OU
it's	OO
actually	OO
the	OO
body's	OO
own	OO
immune	OO
response	OO
that	OO
causes	OO
much	OO
of	OO
the	OO
discomfort	OO
you	OO
feel	OO
every	OO
time	OO
you	OO
get	OO
ill	.O
unfortunately	,U
it	OO
doesn't	OO
always	OO
work	OO
perfectly	.O
most	OU
notably	,O
millions	OO
of	OO
people	OO
worldwide	OO
suffer	OO
from	OO
autoimmune	OO
diseases	,O
in	OO
which	OO
the	OO
immune	OO
system	OO
treats	OO
normal	OO
bodily	OO
cues	OO
as	OO
threats	,O
so	OO
the	OO
body	OO
attacks	OO
itself	.O
but	OU
for	OO
the	OO
majority	OO
of	OO
the	OO
human	OO
race	,O
millions	OO
of	OO
years	OO
of	OO
evolution	OO
have	OO
fine	OO
tuned	OO
the	OO
immune	OO
system	OO
so	OO
that	OO
it	OO
works	OO
for	,O
rather	OO
than	OO
against	OO
us	.O
the	OU
symptoms	OO
of	OO
our	OO
illnesses	OO
are	OO
annoying	,O

collectively	,O
they	OO

an	OO

some	OU

generate	OO
electricity	.O
my	OU
work	OO
is	OO
in	OO
museums	OO
all	OO
over	OO
the	OO
world	,O
such	OO
as	OO
moma	.U
and	,U
i	OU
mean	,O
it	OO
all	OO
went	OO
quite	OO
well	,O
but	OO
it	OO
always	OO
felt	OO
that	OO
something	OO
was	OO
missing	.O
and	OU
it	OO
was	,O
until	OO
i	OU
read	OO
the	OO
book	OO
called	OO
the	OO
solar	OU
revolution	,U
where	OO
it	OO
says	OO
that	OO
within	OO
one	OO
hour	OO
we	OO
receive	OO
enough	OO
sunlight	OO
to	OO
provide	OO
the	OO
world	OO
with	OO
enough	OO
electricity	OO
for	OO
an	OO
entire	OO
year	.O
one	OU
hour	.O
and	OU
since	OO
then	,O
i	OU
realized	OO
i	OU
just	OO
want	OO
to	OO
focus	OO
on	OO
solar	.O
scientists	OU
all	OO
over	OO
the	OO
world	OO
have	OO
been	OO
focusing	OO
on	OO
making	OO
solar	OO
panels	OO
more	OO
efficient	OO
and	OO
cheaper	.O
so	OU
the	OO
price	OO
of	OO
solar	OO
has	OO
dropped	OO
enormously	.O
and	OU
this	OO
is	OO
because	OO
china	OU
started	OO
producing	OO
them	OO
on	OO
a	OO
large	OO
scale	.O
and	OU
also	OO
their	OO
efficiency	OO
has	OO
increased	OO
a	OO
lot	.O
they	OU
now	OO
even	OO
have	OO
an	OO
efficiency	OO
of	OO
44.5	OO
percent	.O
but	OU
if	OO
you	OO
think	OO
about	OO
the	OO
image	OO
of	OO
solar	OO
cells	,O
it's	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
stayed	OO
the	OO
same	OO
for	OO
the	OO
last	OO
60	OO
years	.O
it's	OU
still	OO
this	OO
technology	OO
just	OO
stacked	OO
onto	OO
something	.O
and	OU
solar	OO
cells	OO
need	OO
to	OO
be	OO
much	OO
better	OO
integrated	OO
into	OO
our	OO
environment	.O
climate	OU
change	OO
is	OO
the	OO
biggest	OO
problem	OO
of	OO
our	OO
time	.O
and	OU
we	OO
can't	OO
rely	OO
on	OO
the	OO
others	OO
—	OO
the	OO
government	,O
the	OO
engineers	OO
—	OO
to	OO
make	OO
positive	OO
changes	.O
we	OU
all	OO
can	OO
contribute	OO
towards	OO
change	.O
like	OU
i	OU
said	,O
i'm	OU
a	OO
designer	OO
and	OO
i	OU
would	OO
like	OO
to	OO
change	OO
things	OO
through	OO
design	.O
let	OU
me	OO
give	OO
you	OO
some	OO
examples	OO
of	OO
my	OO
work	.O
i'm	OU
collaborating	OO
with	OO
swarovski	,U
the	OO
crystal	OO
company	.O
and	OU
if	OO
you	OO
cut	OO
crystals	OO
in	OO
a	OO
certain	OO
way	,O
you	OO
are	OO
able	OO
to	OO
bend	OO
and	OO
direct	OO
the	OO
light	OO
onto	OO
a	OO
certain	OO
place	.O
so	OU
i	OU
use	OO
these	OO
crystals	OO
to	OO
focus	OO
the	OO
light	OO
onto	OO
a	OO
solar	OO
panel	,O
making	OO
them	OO
more	OO
efficient	,O
but	OO
using	OO
aesthetics	.O
so	OU
you	OO
take	OO
the	OO
solar	OO
crystal	OO
with	OO
you	OO
in	OO
the	OO
light	,O
there's	OO
a	OO
battery	OO
in	OO
the	OO
solar	OO
cell	,O
you	OO
put	OO
it	OO
in	OO
a	OO
docking	OO
station	OO
and	OO
you	OO
are	OO
able	OO
to	OO
power	OO
these	OO
chandeliers	.O
so	OU
you're	OO
literally	OO
bringing	OO
the	OO
light	OO
indoors	.O
i	OU
got	OO
completely	OO
hooked	OO
on	OO
solar	OO
when	OO
i	OU
came	OO
across	OO
this	OO
technology	OO
called	OO
dye	OO
sensitized	OO
solar	OO
cells	,O
colored	OO
solar	OO
cells	,O
and	OO
they	OO
are	OO
based	OO
on	OO
photosynthesis	OO
in	OO
plants	.O
where	OU
the	OO
green	OO
chlorophyl	OO
converts	OO
light	OO
into	OO
sugar	OO
for	OO
plants	,O
these	OO
cells	OO
convert	OO
light	OO
into	OO
electricity	.O
the	OU
best	OO
thing	OO
is	,O
they	OO
even	OO
work	OO
indoors	.O
so	OU
different	OO
colors	OO
have	OO
different	OO
efficiency	,O
depending	OO
on	OO
their	OO
place	OO
on	OO
the	OO
color	OO
spectrum	.O
so	,U
for	OO
example	,O
red	OO
is	OO
more	OO
efficient	OO
than	OO
blue	.O
so	OU
if	OO
i	OU
hear	OO
this	OO
as	OO
a	OO
designer:	OO
a	OO
colored	OO
surface	,O
a	OO
glass	OO
colored	OO
surface	,O
color	OO
that's	OO
mostly	OO
just	OO
used	OO
for	OO
esthetics	,O
now	OO
gets	OO
an	OO
extra	OO
function	OO
and	OO
is	OO
able	OO
to	OO
harvest	OO
electricity	,O
i	OU
think	,O
where	OO
can	OO
we	OO
apply	OO
this	,O
then	?O
this	OU
is	OO
current	OU
table	,U
where	OO
the	OO
whole	OO
tabletop	OO
consists	OO
of	OO
these	OO
colored	OO
solar	OO
cells	.O
there	OU
are	OO
batteries	OO
in	OO
the	OO
legs	OO
where	OO
you	OO
can	OO
charge	OO
your	OO
phone	OO
through	OO
usb	OU
ports	.O
and	OU
in	OO
my	OO
work	,O
it's	OO
always	OO
very	OO
important	,O
the	OO
balance	OO
between	OO
efficiency	OO
and	OO
aesthetics	.O
so	OU
that's	OO
why	OO
the	OO
table	OO
is	OO
orange	,O
because	OO
it	OO
is	OO
a	OO
very	OO
stable	OO
color	OO
for	OO
indoors	.O
and	OU
this	OO
is	OO
always	OO
the	OO
most	OO
asked	OO
question	OO
i	OU
get:	OO
ok	,U
great	,O
but	OO
how	OO
many	OO
phones	OO
can	OO
i	OU
charge	OO
from	OO
this	,O
then	?O
and	OU
before	OO
i	OU
go	OO
to	OO
this	OO
complicated	OO
answer	OO
of	OO
like	,O
well	,U
where	OO
is	OO
the	OO
table	,O
does	OO
it	OO
have	OO
enough	OO
light	,O
is	OO
it	OO
next	OO
to	OO
a	OO
window	?O
the	OU
table	OO
now	OO
has	OO
sensors	OO
that	OO
read	OO
the	OO
light	OO
intensity	OO
of	OO
the	OO
room	.O
so	OU
through	OO
an	OO
app	OO
we	OO
developed	OO
you	OO
can	OO
literally	OO
follow	OO
how	OO
much	OO
light	OO
it's	OO
getting	,O
and	OO
how	OO
full	OO
the	OO
battery	OO
is	.O
i'm	OU
actually	OO
proud	,O
because	OO
yesterday	OO
we	OO
installed	OO
a	OO
table	OO
at	OO
stichting	OU
doen's	OU
offices	OO
in	OO
amsterdam	OU
and	,O
right	OO
at	OO
this	OO
moment	,O
our	OO
queen	OU
maxima	OU
is	OO
charging	OO
a	OO
phone	OO
from	OO
this	OO
table	.O
it's	OU
cool	.O
so	OU
the	OO
more	OO
surface	OO
you	OO
have	,O
the	OO
more	OO
energy	OO
you	OO
can	OO
harvest	.O
these	OU
are	OO
current	OU
windows	,U
where	OO
we	OO
replaced	OO
all	OO
windows	OO
in	OO
a	OO
gallery	OO
in	OO
london	,U
in	OO
soho	,U
with	OO
this	OO
modern	OO
version	OO
of	OO
stained	OO
glass	.O
so	OU
people	OO
from	OO
the	OO
street	OO
could	OO
come	OO
and	OO
charge	OO
their	OO
phones	OO
through	OO
the	OO
window	OO
ledges	.O
so	OU
i'm	OU
giving	OO
extra	OO
functions	OO
to	OO
objects	.O
a	OU
window	OO
doesn't	OO
have	OO
to	OO
be	OO
just	OO
a	OO
window	OO
anymore	.O
it	OU
can	OO
also	OO
function	OO
as	OO
a	OO
little	OO
power	OO
station	.O
so	,U
here	OO
i	OU
am	,O
talking	OO
about	OO
how	OO
much	OO
i	OU
love	OO
solar	,O
but	OO
i	OU
don't	OO
have	OO
solar	OO
panels	OO
on	OO
my	OO
roof	.O
i	OU
live	OO
in	OO
the	OO
center	OO
of	OO
amsterdam	,U
i	OU
don't	OO
own	OO
the	OO
house	OO
and	OO
it's	OO
a	OO
monument	,O
so	OO
it's	OO
not	OO
possible	OO
and	OO
not	OO
allowed	.O
so	OU
how	OO
can	OO
you	OO
make	OO
solar	OO
cells	OO
more	OO
accessible	OO
and	OO
for	OO
everyone	,O
and	OO
not	OO
only	OO
for	OO
the	OO
people	OO
that	OO
can	OO
afford	OO
a	OO
sustainable	OO
lifestyle	?O
we	OU
now	OO
have	OO
the	OO
opportunity	OO
to	OO
integrate	OO
solar	OO
on	OO
the	OO
place	OO
where	OO
we	OO
directly	OO
need	OO
it	.O
and	OU
there	OO
are	OO
so	OO
many	OO
amazing	OO
technologies	OO
out	OO
there	.O
if	OU
i	OU
look	OO
around	OO
now	,O
i	OU
see	OO
every	OO
surface	OO
as	OO
an	OO
opportunity	.O
for	OU
example	,O
i	OU
was	OO
driving	OO
in	OO
the	OO
train	OO
through	OO
the	OO
westland	,U
the	OO
area	OO
in	OO
the	OO
netherlands	OU
with	OO
all	OO
the	OO
greenhouses	.O
there	OU
i	OU
saw	OO
all	OO
this	OO
glass	OO
and	OO
thought	,O
what	OO
if	OO
we	OO
integrate	OO
those	OO
with	OO
transparent	OO
solar	OO
glass	?O
what	OU
if	OO
we	OO
integrate	OO
traditional	OO
farming	OO
that	OO
requires	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
energy	OO
together	OO
with	OO
high	OO
tech	OO
and	OO
combine	OO
those	?O
with	OU
this	OO
idea	OO
in	OO
mind	,O
i	OU
created	OO
power	OU
plant	.U
i	OU
had	OO
a	OO
team	OO
of	OO
architects	OO
and	OO
engineers	,O
but	OO
let	OO
me	OO
first	OO
explain	OO
how	OO
it	OO
works	.O
we	OU
use	OO
transparent	OO
solar	OO
glass	OO
to	OO
power	OO
its	OO
indoor	OO
climate	.O
we	OU
use	OO
hydroponics	OO
that	OO
pumps	OO
around	OO
nutrified	OO
water	,O
saving	OO
90	OO
percent	OO
of	OO
water	OO
usage	.O
by	OU
stacking	OO
up	OO
in	OO
layers	,O
you	OO
are	OO
able	OO
to	OO
grow	OO
more	OO
yield	OO
per	OO
square	OO
meter	.O
extra	OU
light	,O
besides	OO
sunlight	,O
coming	OO
from	OO
these	OO
colored	OO
led	OU
lights	OO
also	OO
enhances	OO
plant	OO
growth	.O
as	OU
more	OO
and	OO
more	OO
people	OO
will	OO
live	OO
in	OO
big	OO
cities	,O
by	OO
placing	OO
power	OU
plants	OU
on	OO
the	OO
rooftops	OO
you	OO
don't	OO
have	OO
to	OO
fly	OO
it	OO
in	OO
from	OO
the	OO
other	OO
side	OO
of	OO
the	OO
world	,O
you	OO
are	OO
able	OO
to	OO
grow	OO
it	OO
on	OO
the	OO
location	OO
itself	.O
well	,U
the	OO
big	OO
dream	OO
is	OO
to	OO
build	OO
these	OO
in	OO
off	OO
grid	OO
places	OO
—	OO
where	OO
there's	OO
no	OO
access	OO
to	OO
water	,O
electricity	OO
—	OO
as	OO
an	OO
independent	OO
ecosystem	.O
for	OU
this	OO
year's	OO
design	OU
biennial	,U
i	OU
created	OO
the	OO
first	OO
four	OO
meter	OO
high	OO
model	OO
of	OO
the	OO
power	OO
plant	,O
so	OO
you	OO
could	OO
come	OO
in	OO
and	OO
experience	OO
how	OO
plants	OO
grow	.O
so	OU
it's	OO
a	OO
double	OO
harvest	OO
of	OO
sunlight	,O
so	OO
both	OO
for	OO
the	OO
solar	OO
cells	OO
and	OO
for	OO
the	OO
plants	.O
it's	OU
like	OO
a	OO
future	OO
botanical	OO
garden	,O
where	OO
we	OO
celebrate	OO
all	OO
these	OO
modern	OO
technologies	.O
and	OU
the	OO
biggest	OO
compliment	OO
i	OU
got	OO
was	,O
but	OU
where	OO
are	OO
the	OO
solar	OO
panels	?O
and	OU
that's	OO
when	OO
i	OU
think	OO
design	OO
really	OO
works	,O
when	OO
it	OO
becomes	OO
invisible	OO
and	OO
you	OO
don't	OO
notice	OO
it	.O
i	OU
believe	OO
in	OO
solar	OO
democracy:	OO

for	OO
everyone	,O
everywhere	.O
my	OU
aim	OO
is	OO
to	OO

to	OO

where	OO
all	OO
the	OO

think	OU
about	OO
this	OO
on	OO
a	OO

there	OO

so	OO
many	OO

the	OU

by	OO

on	OO
the	OO

we	OO
now	OO

currently	,U
the	OO

it's	OO

to	OO
tell	OO
if	OO
this	OO
65	OO

a	OO

the	OO

what	OO

what's	OU
the	OO

they	OO

very	OO

quite	OO
differently	OO
in	OO
our	OO

glucose	OU

the	OO
best	OO
source	OO
of	OO

for	OO

all	OO

it	OU

in	OO
the	OO

fructose	,U
on	OO
the	OO
other	OO
hand	,O
is	OO
metabolized	OO
primarily	OO
in	OO
the	OO

and	OO
when	OO
your	OO

gets	OO
overloaded	OO
with	OO
sweet	,O
sweet	OO
fructose	,O
the	OO
excess	OO

to	OO

fresh	OU
fruits	OO
actually	OO
contain	OO
fructose	,O
but	OO
it's	OO
naturally	OO
occurring	OO
and	OO
doesn't	OO
cause	OO
an	OO
overload	OO
because	OO
the	OO
fiber	OO
in	OO
fruit	OO
slows	OO
its	OO
absorption	.O
this	OU
gives	OO
your	OO
liver	OO
the	OO
time	OO
it	OO
needs	OO
to	OO
do	OO
its	OO
job	.O
it's	OU
sugar	OO
that	OO
makes	OO
cookies	OO

crunchy	.O
it	OU
even	OO
turns	OO
bread	OO

a	OO
beautiful	,O
golden	OO
brown	.O
it's	OU
also	OO
a	OO
great	OO
preservative;	OO
it	OO
doesn't	OO
spoil	OO
or	OO
evaporate	,O
so	OO
the	OO
foods	OO

easier	OO
to	OO
store	OO

that's	OU

so	OU
where's	OO
the	OO

the	OO

the	OO

organ	OO
that	OO

and	OO
nourishes	OO
the	OO

while	OO
it	OO

in	OU
most	OO

the	OO
placenta	OO
is	OO
confined	OO
behind	OO
a	OO

in	OO

the	OO

the	OO

a	OU

the	OO

as	OU
it	OO

a	OO

that	OO

the	OO

this	OU
is	OO
where	OO

starts	OO
with	OO
a	OO
process	OO
called	OO

where	OO
the	OO

embeds	OO
itself	OO
in	OO
the	OO

that	OO

the	OU

it	OO

the	OU

what	OU

it	OU

something	OO

when	OU

it	OO

it	OU

the	OO

the	OO
less	OO
my	OO

the	OO

reduced	.O
so	OU
i	OU
became	OO
curious	OO

how	OO
these	OO

who	OO

the	OO

the	OU

the	OO

the	OU
astronauts	OO
—	OO
who	OU
are	OO
the	OO
astronauts	?O
they	OU
are	OO
professionals	,O
high	OO
level	OO
technicians	.O
they	OU
are	OO
experimenters	,O
because	OO
they	OO
perform	OO
the	OO
scientific	OO
experiments	OO
that	OO
we	OO
doctors	OO
and	OO

design	.O
they	OU
are	OO
also	OO
the	OO
subjects	OO
of	OO
our	OO

because	OO
we	OO
do	OO
experiments	OO
on	OO
them	.O
the	OU
question	OO
that	OO
you	OO
will	OO
ask	,O
of	OO

is:	OO
if	OO
the	OO
astronauts	OO
are	OO
all	OO
healthy	,O
why	OO
do	OO
they	OO
need	OO
a	OO
doctor	?O
they	OU
actually	OO
do	,O
because	OO
my	OO
work	OO
within	OO
the	OO
research	,O
like	OO
those	OO
of	OO
my	OO
colleagues	,O
is	OO
to	OO
enable	OO
the	OO
astronauts	OO
to	OO
overcome	OO
their	OO
fiscal	OO
physical	OO
and	OO
psychological	OO
problems	OO
so	OO
they	OO
can	OO
live	OO
and	OO
work	OO
in	OO
space	.O
an	OU
environment	OO
for	OO
which	OO
evolution	OO
didn't	OO
prepare	OO
us	.O
on	OU
the	OO
earth	OU
there	OO
are	OO
two	OO
fundamental	OO
factors;	OO
the	OO
force	OO
of	OO
gravity	OO
that	OO
has	OO
conditioned	OO
our	OO
entire	OO
anatomy	,O
the	OO
rotation	OO
of	OO
earth	OU
and	OO
the	OO
way	OO
it	OO
alternates	OO
between	OO
light	OO
and	OO
darkness	,O
that	OO
has	OO
conditioned	OO
all	OO
of	OO
our	OO
physiology	.O
the	OU
force	OO
of	OO
gravity	OO
has	OO
conditioned	OO
our	OO
anatomy	OO
giving	OO
us	OO
our	OO
symmetrical	OO
body	,O
more	OO
or	OO
less	,O
our	OO
sense	OO
of	OO
balance	,O
the	OO
skeleton	,O
our	OO
muscle	OO
mass	,O
all	OO
of	OO
this	OO
is	OO
conditioned	OO
by	OO
gravity	OO
and	OO
the	OO
fight	OO
against	OO
it	.O
there	OU
is	OO
no	OO
gravity	OO
in	OO
space	,O
so	OO
what	OO
will	OO
happen	?O
they	OU
will	OO
have	OO
balance	OO
problems	,O
they	OO
will	OO
have	OO
decalcification	.O
the	OU
skeleton	OO
that's	OO
up	OO
there	OO
will	OO
have	OO
a	OO
loss	OO
of	OO
muscle	OO
mass	.O
so	.U
we	OO
have	OO
designed	OO
a	OO
series	OO
of	OO
physical	OO
exercises	OO
with	OO
very	OO
precise	OO
protocols	OO
which	OO
take	OO
into	OO
account	OO
all	OO
of	OO
the	OO
sectors	OO
of	OO
the	OO
body	,O
so	OO
they	OO
can	OO
stay	OO
in	OO
shape	.O
because	,U
in	OO
addition	,O
the	OO
astronauts	OO
aren't	OO
weighed	OO
down	,O
so	OO
they	OO
stretch	,O
growing	OO
about	OO
one	OO
inch	.O
and	OU
this	OO
produces	OO
pain	.O
short	OU
people	OO
don't	OO
have	OO
expectations	,O
because	OO
when	OO
you	OO
return	,O
you	OO
shrink	OO
—	OO
so	,U
at	OO
this	OO
moment	,O
we	OO
are	OO
all	OO
working	OO
to	OO
ease	OO
this	OO
type	OO
of	OO
pain	,O
creating	OO
a	OO
super	OO
skin	OO
suit	,O
that	OO
is	OO
the	OO
suit	OO
that	OO
the	OO

use	OO
here	,O
that	OO
we	OO
tried	OO
for	OO
the	OO

three	OO

about	OO

the	OO

when	OU
this	OO

all	OO

and	,U
of	OO

that	OO
together	OO
with	OO
all	OO
of	OO
the	OO

all	OO
of	OO
the	OO

variables	.O
from	OU
the	OO
first	OO

to	OO

we	OO
learned	OO
that	OO
the	OO

the	OU

altered	.O
the	OU

that	OO

is	OO
affected	.O
above	OU
all	,O
the	OO

of	OO
the	OO

with	OO
the	OO
long	OO
working	OO
hours	OO
from	OO
8	OO
am	OO
to	OO
10	OO

so	OO
they	OO
can	OO
execute	OO
all	OO
of	OO
the	OO
protocols	,O
that	OO
we	OO
give	OO
them	OO
to	OO
do	.O
and	OU
also	OO
the	OO
constant	OO
noise	OO
of	OO
ventilation	,O
up	OO
to	OO
60	OO

70	OO
decibels	OO
to	OO

the	OO

the	OU
light	OO
that	OO

that	OO
bright	.O
however	,U
in	OO
30	OO
years	OO
of	OO

we	OO
have	OO
been	OO
able	OO
to	OO
improve	OO
a	OO
few	OO
of	OO
the	OO
working	OO
conditions	.O
the	OU
simple	OO
things:	OO
a	OO
comfortable	OO
sleeping	OO
bag	,O
which	OO
produces	OO
in	OO

the	OO
same	OO
pleasing	OO
sensation	OO
that	OO
we	OO
feel	OO
when	OO
we	OO
go	OO
to	OO
lie	OO
down	OO
and	OO
are	OO
between	OO
the	OO

also	,U
the	OO
nutrition:	OO
it's	OU
not	OO
only	OO
to	OO
cover	OO
nutritional	OO
and	OO
metabolic	OO
needs	OO
—	OO
because	OO
you	OO
have	OO
to	OO
be	OO
really	OO
hungry	OO
to	OO
want	OO
to	OO

this	OO
—	OO
but	OU
also	,O
to	OO
take	OO

the	OO

that's	OU
why	OO

that's	OU
a	OO

it	OO

the	OO

the	OU

this	,O
above	OO
all	OO
for	OO
the	OO

i	OU
want	OO
to	OO
tell	OO
you	OO
that	OO
i	OU
really	OO
hope	OO
that	OO
you	OO

and	OO
that	OO
you	OO

a	OO
prophylactic	OO
for	OO
a	OO
disease	,O
but	OO
a	OO
whole	OO
new	OO
way	OO
of	OO
thinking:	OO
that	OO
medicine	OO
could	OO
prevent	OO
disease	.O
however	,U
for	OO
over	OO
200	OO
years	,O
this	OO
prevention	OO
was	OO
not	OO
believed	OO
to	OO
extend	OO
to	OO
psychiatric	OO
diseases	.O
until	OU
2014	,O
when	OO
my	OO
colleague	OO
and	OO
i	OU
accidentally	OO
discovered	OO
the	OO
first	OO
drugs	OO
that	OO
might	OO
prevent	OO
depression	OO
and	OO
ptsd	.U
we	OU
discovered	OO
the	OO
drugs	OO
in	OO
mice	,O
and	OO
we're	OO
currently	OO
studying	OO
whether	OO
they	OO
work	OO
in	OO
humans	.O
and	OU
these	OO
preventative	OO
psychopharmaceuticals	OO
are	OO
not	OO
antidepressants	.O
they	OU
are	OO
a	OO
whole	OO
new	OO
class	OO
of	OO
drug	.O
and	OU
they	OO
work	OO
by	OO
increasing	OO
stress	OO
resilience	,O
so	OO
let's	OO
call	OO
them	OO
resilience	OO
enhancers	.O
so	OU
think	OO
back	OO
to	OO
a	OO
stressful	OO
time	OO
that	OO
you've	OO
since	OO
recovered	OO
from	.O
maybe	OU
a	OO
breakup	OO
or	OO
an	OO
exam	,O
you	OO
missed	OO
a	OO
flight	.O
stress	OU
resilience	OO
is	OO
the	OO
active	OO
biological	OO
process	OO
that	OO
allows	OO
us	OO
to	OO
bounce	OO
back	OO
after	OO
stress	.O
similar	OU
to	OO
if	OO
you	OO
have	OO
a	OO
cold	OO
and	OO
your	OO
immune	OO
system	OO
fights	OO
it	OO
off	.O
and	OU
insufficient	OO
resilience	OO
in	OO
the	OO
face	OO
of	OO
a	OO
significant	OO
enough	OO
stressor	,O
can	OO
result	OO
in	OO
a	OO
psychiatric	OO
disorder	,O
such	OO
as	OO
depression	.O
in	OU
fact	,O
most	OO
cases	OO
of	OO
major	OO
depressive	OO
disorder	OO
are	OO
initially	OO
triggered	OO
by	OO
stress	.O
and	OU
from	OO
what	OO
we've	OO
seen	OO
so	OO
far	OO
in	OO
mice	,O
resilience	OO
enhancers	OO
can	OO
protect	OO
against	OO
purely	OO
biological	OO
stressors	,O
like	OO
stress	OO
hormones	,O
and	OO
social	OO
and	OO
psychological	OO
stressors	,O
like	OO
bullying	OO
and	OO
isolation	.O
so	OU
here	OO
is	OO
an	OO
example	OO
where	OO
we	OO
gave	OO
mice	OO
three	OO
weeks	OO
of	OO
high	OO
levels	OO
of	OO
stress	OO
hormones	.O
so	,U
in	OO
other	OO
words	,O
a	OO
biological	OO
stressor	OO
without	OO
a	OO
psychological	OO
component	.O
and	OU
this	OO
causes	OO
depressive	OO
behavior	.O
and	OU
if	OO
we	OO
give	OO
three	OO
weeks	OO
of	OO
antidepressant	OO
treatment	OO
beforehand	,O
it	OO
has	OO
no	OO
beneficial	OO
effects	.O
but	OU
a	OO
single	OO
dose	OO
of	OO
a	OO
resilience	OO
enhancer	OO
given	OO
a	OO
week	OO
before	OO
completely	OO
prevents	OO
the	OO
depressive	OO
behavior	.O
even	OU
after	OO
three	OO
weeks	OO
of	OO
stress	.O
this	OU
is	OO
the	OO
first	OO
time	OO
a	OO
drug	OO
has	OO
ever	OO
been	OO
shown	OO
to	OO
prevent	OO
the	OO
negative	OO
effects	OO
of	OO
stress	.O
depression	OU
and	OO
ptsd	OU
are	OO
chronic	,O
often	OO
lifelong	,O
clinical	OO
diseases	.O
they	OU
also	OO
increase	OO
the	OO
risk	OO
of	OO
substance	OO
abuse	,O
homelessness	,O
heart	OO
disease	,O
alzheimer's	,U
suicide	.O
the	OU
global	OO
cost	OO
of	OO
depression	OO
alone	OO
is	OO
over	OO
three	OO

per	OO

but	OU
now	,O
imagine	OO
a	OO
scenario	OO
where	OO
we	OO

someone	OO
is	OO
predictively	OO
at	OO
high	OO
risk	OO
for	OO
exposure	OO
to	OO
extreme	OO

say	,U
a	OO
red	OO

volunteer	OO
going	OO
into	OO
an	OO
earthquake	OO
zone	.O
in	OU
addition	OO
to	OO
the	OO

we	OO
could	OO

a	OO
pill	OO
or	OO
an	OO
injection	OO
of	OO
a	OO
resilience	OO

before	OO
she	OO

so	OU
when	OO
she	OO
is	OO
held	OO
at	OO

by	OO

or	OO
worse	,O
she	OO
would	OO
at	OO

be	OO
protected	OO
against	OO
developing	OO
depression	OO
or	OO
ptsd	OU
after	OO
the	OO
fact	.O
it	OU
won't	OO
prevent	OO
her	OO
from	OO
experiencing	OO
the	OO

but	OO
it	OO
will	OO
allow	OO
her	OO
to	OO
recover	OO
from	OO
it	.O
and	OU
that's	OO
what's	OO
revolutionary	OO
here	.O
by	OU
increasing	OO
resiliency	,O
we	OO
can	OO
dramatically	OO
reduce	OO
her	OO

her	OO
from	OO

her	OO

her	OO

her	OO

why	?U

that	OO

all	OO

they	OO

to	OO

and	OO
they	OO
do	OO
that	OO
just	OO
like	OO
us	OO
humans	OO
—	OO
by	OO

but	OU
instead	OO
of	OO
using	OO

they	OO
use	OO

to	OO

when	OU
bacteria	OO

few	,O
the	OO

when	OO

that	OO

so	OU

a	OO

a	OO

the	OO

of	OO
the	OO

the	OO

of	OO

how	OO

the	OO

what	OO
is	OO
it	OO
like	OO
when	OO

communicate	?O
before	OU
i	OU
developed	OO
the	OO
translation	OO
tool	,O
my	OO
first	OO
assumption	OO
was	OO
that	OO
bacteria	OO
would	OO
have	OO
a	OO
primitive	OO
language	,O
like	OO
infants	OO
that	OO

when	OU
they	OO

they're	OO

when	OO
they	OO

they're	OO

simple	OU
as	OO
that	.O
but	OU
bacteria	OO
turned	OO
out	OO
to	OO
be	OO
nowhere	OO
as	OO
primitive	OO
as	OO
i	OU
thought	OO
they	OO
would	OO
be	.O
a	OU
molecule	OO
is	OO
not	OO
just	OO
a	OO
molecule	.O
it	OU
can	OO
mean	OO
different	OO
things	OO
depending	OO
on	OO
the	OO
context	,O
just	OO
like	OO
the	OO
crying	OO
of	OO
babies	OO
can	OO
mean	OO
different	OO
things:	OO
sometimes	OO
the	OO
baby	OO
is	OO
hungry	,O
sometimes	OO
it's	OO
wet	,O
sometimes	OO
it's	OO
hurt	OO
or	OO
afraid	.O
parents	OU
know	OO
how	OO
to	OO
decode	OO
those	OO
cries	.O
and	OU
to	OO
be	OO
a	OO
real	OO
translation	OO
tool	,O
it	OO
had	OO
to	OO
be	OO
able	OO
to	OO
decode	OO
the	OO

and	OO
translate	OO
them	OO
depending	OO
on	OO
the	OO

and	OU
who	OO
knows	?O
maybe	OU
google	OU
translate	OU
will	OO
adopt	OO
this	OO
soon	.O
let	OU
me	OO
give	OO
you	OO
an	OO
example	.O
i've	OU
brought	OO
some	OO
bacterial	OO
data	OO
that	OO
can	OO
be	OO
a	OO
bit	OO
tricky	OO
to	OO
understand	OO
if	OO
you're	OO
not	OO
trained	,O
but	OO
try	OO
to	OO
take	OO
a	OO
look	.O
here's	OU
a	OO
happy	OO
bacterial	OO
family	OO
that	OO
has	OO
infected	OO
a	OO
patient	.O
let's	OU
call	OO
them	OO
the	OO
montague	OU
family	.O
they	OU
share	OO
resources	,O
they	OO
reproduce	,O
and	OO
they	OO
grow	.O
one	OU
day	,O
they	OO
get	OO
a	OO
new	OO
neighbor	,O
bacterial	OO
family	OO
capulet	.U
everything	OU
is	OO
fine	,O
as	OO
long	OO
as	OO
they're	OO
working	OO
together	.O
but	OU
then	OO
something	OO
unplanned	OO
happens	.O
romeo	OU
from	OO
montague	OU
has	OO
a	OO
relationship	OO
with	OO
juliet	OU
from	OO
capulet	.U
and	OU
yes	,O
they	OO
share	OO
genetic	OO
material	.O
now	,U
this	OO
gene	OO
transfer	OO
can	OO
be	OO
dangerous	OO
to	OO
the	OO
montagues	OU
that	OO
have	OO
the	OO
ambition	OO
to	OO
be	OO
the	OO
only	OO
family	OO
in	OO
the	OO
patient	OO
they	OO
have	OO
infected	,O
and	OO
sharing	OO
genes	OO
contributes	OO
to	OO
the	OO
capulets	OU
developing	OO
resistance	OO
to	OO
antibiotics	.O
so	OU
the	OO
montagues	OU
start	OO
talking	OO
internally	OO
to	OO
get	OO
rid	OO
of	OO
this	OO
other	OO
family	OO
by	OO
releasing	OO
this	OO
molecule	.O
and	OU
with	OO
subtitles:	OO
let's	OU
coordinate	OO
an	OO
attack	.O
and	OU
then	OO
everybody	OO
at	OO
once	OO
responds	OO
by	OO
releasing	OO
a	OO
poison	OO
that	OO
will	OO
kill	OO
the	OO
other	OO
family	.O
the	OU
capulets	OU
respond	OO
by	OO
calling	OO
for	OO
a	OO
counterattack	.O
and	OU
they	OO
have	OO
a	OO
battle	.O
this	OU
is	OO
a	OO
video	OO
of	OO
real	OO
bacteria	OO
dueling	OO
with	OO
swordlike	OO
organelles	,O
where	OO
they	OO
try	OO
to	OO
kill	OO
each	OO
other	OO
by	OO
literally	OO
stabbing	OO
and	OO
rupturing	OO
each	OO
other	.O
whoever's	OU
family	OO
wins	OO
this	OO
battle	OO
becomes	OO
the	OO
dominant	OO
bacteria	.O
so	OU
what	OO
i	OU
can	OO
do	OO
is	OO
to	OO
detect	OO
bacterial	OO
conversations	OO
that	OO
lead	OO
to	OO
different	OO

the	OO

what	OO

to	OO

sample	OO
was	OO
transferred	OO
for	OO

analysis	OO
at	OO
the	OO

so	OO
the	OO
doctors	OO
could	OO
act	OO
quickly	OO
if	OO
they	OO
discovered	OO
an	OO
infection	.O
and	OU
it	OO
allowed	OO
me	OO
to	OO
test	OO
my	OO

well	.O
the	OU
first	OO
two	OO

i	OU
measured	OO
on	OO
her	OO

there	OO
was	OO
nothing	.O
but	OU
the	OO
third	OO
month	,O
i	OU
discovered	OO
some	OO
bacterial	OO
chatter	OO
in	OO
her	OO
sample	.O
the	OU
bacteria	OO
were	OO
coordinating	OO
to	OO
damage	OO
her	OO
lung	OO

but	OU
the	OO
traditional	OO
diagnostics	OO
showed	OO
no	OO
bacteria	OO
at	OO
all	.O
i	OU
measured	OO
again	OO
the	OO
next	OO
month	,O
and	OO
i	OU
could	OO
see	OO
that	OO
the	OO
bacterial	OO
conversations	OO
became	OO
even	OO
more	OO
aggressive	.O
still	,U
the	OO
traditional	OO
diagnostics	OO
showed	OO
nothing	.O
my	OU
study	OO
ended	,O
but	OO
a	OO
half	OO
a	OO
year	OO
later	,O
i	OU
followed	OO
up	OO
on	OO
her	OO
status	OO
to	OO
see	OO
if	OO
the	OO
bacteria	OO
only	OO
i	OU
knew	OO
about	OO
had	OO
disappeared	OO
without	OO
medical	OO
intervention	.O
they	OU
hadn't	.O
but	OU
the	OO
girl	OO
was	OO
now	OO
diagnosed	OO
with	OO
a	OO
severe	OO
infection	OO
of	OO
deadly	OO
bacteria	.O
it	OU
was	OO
the	OO
very	OO
same	OO
bacteria	OO
my	OO
tool	OO
discovered	OO
earlier	.O
and	OU
despite	OO
aggressive	OO
antibiotic	OO
treatment	,O
it	OO
was	OO
impossible	OO
to	OO
eradicate	OO
the	OO
infection	.O
doctors	OU
deemed	OO
that	OO
she	OO
would	OO
not	OO
survive	OO
her	OO
20s	.O
when	OU
i	OU
measured	OO
on	OO
this	OO
girl's	OO
samples	,O
my	OO
tool	OO
was	OO
still	OO
in	OO
the	OO
initial	OO
stage	.O
i	OU
didn't	OO
even	OO
know	OO
if	OO
my	OO
method	OO
worked	OO
at	OO
all	,O
therefore	OO
i	OU
had	OO
an	OO
agreement	OO
with	OO
the	OO
doctors	OO
not	OO
to	OO
tell	OO
them	OO
what	OO
my	OO
tool	OO
revealed	OO
in	OO
order	OO
not	OO
to	OO
compromise	OO
their	OO
treatment	.O
so	OU
when	OO
i	OU
saw	OO
these	OO
results	OO
that	OO
weren't	OO
even	OO
validated	,O
i	OU
didn't	OO
dare	OO
to	OO
tell	OO
because	OO
treating	OO
a	OO
patient	OO
without	OO
an	OO
actual	OO
infection	OO
also	OO
has	OO
negative	OO
consequences	OO
for	OO
the	OO
patient	.O
but	OU
now	OO
we	OO
know	OO
better	,O
and	OO
there	OO
are	OO
many	OO
young	OO
boys	OO
and	OO
girls	OO
that	OO
still	OO
can	OO
be	OO
saved	OO
because	,O
unfortunately	,O
this	OO
scenario	OO
happens	OO
very	OO
often	.O
patients	OU
get	OO
infected	,O
the	OO
bacteria	OO
somehow	OO
don't	OO
show	OO
on	OO
the	OO
traditional	OO
diagnostic	OO
test	,O
and	OO
suddenly	,O
the	OO
infection	OO
breaks	OO
out	OO
in	OO
the	OO
patient	OO
with	OO
severe	OO
symptoms	.O
and	OU
at	OO
that	OO
point	,O
it's	OO
already	OO
too	OO
late	.O
the	OU
surprising	OO
result	OO
of	OO
the	OO
62	OO
patients	OO
i	OU
followed	OO
was	OO
that	OO
my	OO
device	OO
caught	OO
bacterial	OO
conversations	OO
in	OO
more	OO
than	OO
half	OO
of	OO
the	OO
patient	OO
samples	OO
that	OO
were	OO
diagnosed	OO
as	OO
negative	OO
by	OO
traditional	OO
methods	.O
in	OU
other	OO
words	,O
more	OO
than	OO
half	OO
of	OO
these	OO
patients	OO
went	OO
home	OO
thinking	OO
they	OO
were	OO
free	OO
from	OO
infection	,O
although	OO
they	OO
actually	OO
carried	OO
dangerous	OO
bacteria	.O
inside	OU
these	OO
wrongly	OO
diagnosed	OO
patients	,O
bacteria	OO
were	OO
coordinating	OO
a	OO
synchronized	OO
attack	.O
they	OU
were	OO
whispering	OO
to	OO
each	OO
other	.O
what	OU
i	OU
call	OO
whispering	OO
bacteria	OO
are	OO
bacteria	OO
that	OO
traditional	OO
methods	OO
cannot	OO
diagnose	.O
so	OU
far	,O
it's	OO
only	OO
the	OO
translation	OO
tool	OO
that	OO
can	OO
catch	OO
those	OO

i	OU
believe	OO
that	OO
the	OO
time	OO
frame	OO
in	OO
which	OO
bacteria	OO
are	OO
still	OO
whispering	OO
is	OO
a	OO
window	OO
of	OO

for	OO

treatment	.O
if	OU
the	OO

had	OO
been	OO

during	OO
this	OO
window	OO
of	OO

it	OO
might	OO
have	OO

to	OO
kill	OO
the	OO
bacteria	OO
in	OO
their	OO
initial	OO
stage	,O
before	OO
the	OO

out	OO

what	OU
i	OU

everything	OO

to	OO

i	OU
also	OO

over	OU

in	OU
an	OO

i'd	OU

to	OO

you	OO
about	OO
a	OO
patient	OO
named	OO
donna	.U
in	OU
this	OO
photograph	,O
donna	OU
was	OO
in	OO
her	OO
mid	OO
70s	,O
a	OO
vigorous	,O
healthy	OO
woman	,O
the	OO
matriarch	OO
of	OO
a	OO
large	OO
clan	.O
she	OU
had	OO
a	OO
family	OO
history	OO
of	OO
heart	OO
disease	,O
however	,O
and	OO
one	OO
day	,O
she	OO
had	OO
the	OO
sudden	OO
onset	OO
of	OO
crushing	OO
chest	OO
pain	.O
now	OU
unfortunately	,O
rather	OO
than	OO
seeking	OO
medical	OO
attention	,O
donna	OU
took	OO
to	OO
her	OO
bed	OO
for	OO
about	OO
12	OO
hours	OO
until	OO
the	OO
pain	OO
passed	.O
the	OU
next	OO
time	OO
she	OO
went	OO
to	OO
see	OO
her	OO
physician	,O
he	OO
performed	OO
an	OO
electrocardiogram	,O
and	OO
this	OO
showed	OO
that	OO
she'd	OO
had	OO
a	OO
large	OO
heart	OO
attack	,O
or	OO
a	OO
myocardial	OO
infarction	OO
in	OO
medical	OO
parlance	.O
after	OU
this	OO
heart	OO
attack	,O
donna	OU
was	OO
never	OO
quite	OO
the	OO
same	.O
her	OU
energy	OO
levels	OO
progressively	OO
waned	,O
she	OO
couldn't	OO
do	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
the	OO
physical	OO
activities	OO
she'd	OO
previously	OO
enjoyed	.O
it	OU
got	OO
to	OO
the	OO
point	OO
where	OO
she	OO
couldn't	OO
keep	OO
up	OO
with	OO
her	OO
grandkids	,O
and	OO
it	OO
was	OO
even	OO
too	OO
much	OO
work	OO
to	OO
go	OO
out	OO
to	OO
the	OO
end	OO
of	OO
the	OO
driveway	OO
to	OO
pick	OO
up	OO
the	OO
mail	.O
one	OU
day	,O
her	OO
granddaughter	OO
came	OO
by	OO
to	OO
walk	OO
the	OO
dog	,O
and	OO
she	OO
found	OO
her	OO
grandmother	OO
dead	OO
in	OO
the	OO
chair	.O
doctors	OU
said	OO
it	OO
was	OO
a	OO
cardiac	OO
arrhythmia	OO
that	OO
was	OO
secondary	OO
to	OO
heart	OO
failure	.O
but	OU
the	OO
last	OO
thing	OO
that	OO
i	OU
should	OO
tell	OO
you	OO
is	OO
that	OO
donna	OU
was	OO
not	OO
just	OO
an	OO
ordinary	OO
patient	.O
donna	OU
was	OO
my	OO
mother	.O
stories	OU
like	OO
ours	OO
are	,O
unfortunately	,O
far	OO
too	OO
common	.O
heart	OU
disease	OO
is	OO
the	OO
number	OO
one	OO
killer	OO
in	OO
the	OO
entire	OO
world	.O
in	OU
the	OO
united	OU
states	,U
it's	OO
the	OO
most	OO
common	OO
reason	OO
patients	OO
are	OO
admitted	OO
to	OO
the	OO
hospital	,O
and	OO
it's	OO
our	OO
number	OO
one	OO
health	OO
care	OO
expense	.O
we	OU
spend	OO
over	OO
a	OO
100	OO
billion	OO
dollars	OO
—	OO
billion	OO
with	OO
a	OO
b	OU
—	OO
in	OO
this	OO
country	OO
every	OO
year	OO
on	OO
the	OO
treatment	OO
of	OO
heart	OO
disease	.O
just	OU
for	OO
reference	,O
that's	OO
more	OO
than	OO
twice	OO
the	OO
annual	OO
budget	OO
of	OO
the	OO
state	OO
of	OO
washington	.U
what	OU
makes	OO
this	OO
disease	OO
so	OO
deadly	?O
well	,U
it	OO
all	OO
starts	OO
with	OO
the	OO
fact	OO
that	OO
the	OO
heart	OO
is	OO
the	OO
least	OO
regenerative	OO
organ	OO
in	OO
the	OO
human	OO
body	.O
now	,U
a	OO
heart	OO
attack	OO
happens	OO
when	OO
a	OO
blood	OO
clot	OO
forms	OO
in	OO
a	OO
coronary	OO
artery	OO
that	OO
feeds	OO
blood	OO
to	OO
the	OO
wall	OO
of	OO
the	OO
heart	.O
this	OU
plugs	OO
the	OO
blood	OO
flow	,O
and	OO
the	OO
heart	OO
muscle	OO
is	OO
very	OO
metabolically	OO
active	,O
and	OO
so	OO
it	OO
dies	OO
very	OO
quickly	,O
within	OO
just	OO
a	OO
few	OO
hours	OO
of	OO
having	OO
its	OO
blood	OO
flow	OO
interrupted	.O
since	OU
the	OO
heart	OO
can't	OO
grow	OO
back	OO
new	OO
muscle	,O
it	OO
heals	OO
by	OO
scar	OO
formation	.O
this	OU
leaves	OO
the	OO
patient	OO
with	OO
a	OO
deficit	OO
in	OO
the	OO
amount	OO
of	OO
heart	OO
muscle	OO
that	OO
they	OO
have	.O
and	OU
in	OO
too	OO
many	OO
people	,O
their	OO
illness	OO
progresses	OO
to	OO
the	OO
point	OO
where	OO
the	OO
heart	OO
can	OO
no	OO
longer	OO
keep	OO
up	OO
with	OO
the	OO
body's	OO
demand	OO
for	OO
blood	OO
flow	.O
this	OU
imbalance	OO
between	OO
supply	OO
and	OO
demand	OO
is	OO
the	OO
crux	OO
of	OO
heart	OO
failure	.O
so	OU
when	OO
i	OU
talk	OO
to	OO
people	OO
about	OO
this	OO
problem	,O
i	OU
often	OO
get	OO
a	OO
shrug	OO
and	OO
a	OO
statement	OO
to	OO
the	OO
effect	OO
of	,O
well	,U
you	OO
know	,O
chuck	,U
we've	OO
got	OO
to	OO
die	OO
of	OO
something	.O
and	OU
yeah	,O
but	OO
what	OO
this	OO
also	OO
tells	OO
me	OO
is	OO
that	OO
we've	OO
resigned	OO
ourselves	OO
to	OO
this	OO
as	OO
the	OO
status	OO
quo	OO
because	OO
we	OO
have	OO
to	.O
or	OU
do	OO
we	?O
i	OU
think	OO
there's	OO
a	OO
better	OO
way	,O
and	OO
this	OO
better	OO
way	OO
involves	OO
the	OO
use	OO
of	OO
stem	OO
cells	OO
as	OO
medicines	.O
so	OU
what	,O
exactly	,O
are	OO
stem	OO
cells	?O
if	OU
you	OO
look	OO
at	OO
them	OO
under	OO
the	OO
microscope	,O
there's	OO
not	OO
much	OO
going	OO
on	.O
they're	OU
just	OO
simple	OO
little	OO
round	OO
cells	.O
but	OU
that	OO
belies	OO
two	OO
remarkable	OO
attributes	.O
the	OU
first	OO
is	OO
they	OO
can	OO
divide	OO
like	OO
crazy	.O
so	OU
i	OU
can	OO
take	OO
a	OO
single	OO
cell	,O
and	OO
in	OO
a	OO
month's	OO
time	,O
i	OU
can	OO
grow	OO
this	OO
up	OO
to	OO
billions	OO
of	OO
cells	.O
the	OU
second	OO
is	OO
they	OO
can	OO
differentiate	OO
or	OO
become	OO
more	OO
specialized	,O
so	OO
these	OO
simple	OO
little	OO
round	OO
cells	OO
can	OO
turn	OO
into	OO
skin	,O
can	OO
turn	OO
into	OO
brain	,O
can	OO
turn	OO
into	OO
kidney	OO
and	OO
so	OO
forth	.O
now	,U
some	OO
tissues	OO
in	OO
our	OO
bodies	OO
are	OO
chock	OO
full	OO
of	OO
stem	OO
cells	.O
our	OU
bone	OO
marrow	,O
for	OO
example	,O
cranks	OO
out	OO
billions	OO
of	OO
blood	OO
cells	OO
every	OO
day	.O
other	OU
tissues	OO
like	OO
the	OO
heart	OO
are	OO
quite	OO
stable	,O
and	OO
as	OO
far	OO
as	OO
we	OO
can	OO
tell	,O
the	OO
heart	OO
lacks	OO
stem	OO
cells	OO
entirely	.O
so	OU
for	OO
the	OO
heart	,O
we're	OO
going	OO
to	OO
have	OO
to	OO
bring	OO
stem	OO
cells	OO
in	OO
from	OO
the	OO
outside	,O
and	OO
for	OO
this	,O
we	OO
turn	OO
to	OO
the	OO
most	OO
potent	OO
stem	OO
cell	OO
type	,O
the	OO
pluripotent	OO
stem	OO
cell	.O
pluripotent	OU
stem	OO
cells	OO
are	OO
so	OO
named	OO
because	OO
they	OO
can	OO
turn	OO
into	OO
any	OO
of	OO
the	OO
240	OO
some	OO
cell	OO
types	OO
that	OO
make	OO
up	OO
the	OO
human	OO
body	.O
so	OU
this	OO
is	OO
my	OO
big	OO
idea:	OO
i	OU
want	OO
to	OO
take	OO
human	OO
pluripotent	OO
stem	OO
cells	,O
grow	OO
them	OO
up	OO
in	OO
large	OO
numbers	,O
differentiate	OO
them	OO
into	OO
cardiac	OO
muscle	OO
cells	OO
and	OO
then	OO
take	OO
them	OO
out	OO
of	OO
the	OO
dish	OO
and	OO
transplant	OO
them	OO
into	OO
the	OO
hearts	OO
of	OO
patients	OO
who	OO
have	OO
had	OO
heart	OO
attacks	.O
i	OU
think	OO
this	OO
is	OO
going	OO
to	OO
reseed	OO
the	OO
wall	OO
with	OO
new	OO
muscle	OO
tissue	,O
and	OO
this	OO
will	OO
restore	OO
contractile	OO
function	OO
to	OO
the	OO
heart	.O
now	,U
before	OO
you	OO
applaud	OO
too	OO
much	,O
this	OO
was	OO
my	OO
idea	OO
20	OO
years	OO
ago	.O
and	OU
i	OU
was	OO
young	,O
i	OU
was	OO
full	OO
of	OO
it	,O
and	OO
i	OU
thought	,O
five	OO
years	OO
in	OO
the	OO
lab	,O
and	OO
we'll	OO
crank	OO
this	OO
out	,O
and	OO
we'll	OO
have	OO
this	OO
into	OO
the	OO
clinic	.O
let	OU
me	OO
tell	OO
you	OO
what	OO
really	OO
happened	.O
we	OU
began	OO
with	OO
the	OO
quest	OO
to	OO
turn	OO
these	OO
pluripotent	OO
stem	OO
cells	OO
into	OO
heart	OO
muscle	.O
and	OU
our	OO
first	OO
experiments	OO
worked	,O
sort	OO
of	.O
we	OU
got	OO
these	OO
little	OO
clumps	OO
of	OO
beating	OO
human	OO
heart	OO
muscle	OO
in	OO
the	OO
dish	,O
and	OO
that	OO
was	OO
cool	,O
because	OO
it	OO
said	,O
in	OO
principle	,O
this	OO
should	OO
be	OO
able	OO
to	OO
be	OO
done	.O
but	OU
when	OO
we	OO
got	OO
around	OO
to	OO
doing	OO
the	OO
cell	OO
counts	,O
we	OO
found	OO
that	OO
only	OO
one	OO
out	OO
of	OO
1,000	OO
of	OO
our	OO
stem	OO
cells	OO
were	OO
actually	OO
turning	OO
into	OO
heart	OO
muscle	.O
the	OU
rest	OO
was	OO
just	OO
a	OO
gemisch	OO
of	OO
brain	OO
and	OO
skin	OO
and	OO
cartilage	OO
and	OO
intestine	.O
so	OU
how	OO
do	OO
you	OO
coax	OO
a	OO
cell	OO
that	OO
can	OO
become	OO
anything	OO
into	OO
becoming	OO
just	OO
a	OO
heart	OO
muscle	OO
cell	?O
well	,U
for	OO
this	OO
we	OO
turned	OO
to	OO
the	OO
world	OO
of	OO
embryology	.O
for	OU
over	OO
a	OO
century	,O
the	OO
embryologists	OO
had	OO
been	OO
pondering	OO
the	OO
mysteries	OO
of	OO
heart	OO
development	.O
and	OU
they	OO
had	OO
given	OO
us	OO
what	OO
was	OO
essentially	OO
a	OO
google	OU
map	OU
for	OO
how	OO
to	OO
go	OO
from	OO
a	OO
single	OO
fertilized	OO
egg	OO
all	OO
the	OO
way	OO
over	OO
to	OO
a	OO
human	OO
cardiovascular	OO
system	.O
so	OU
we	OO
shamelessly	OO
absconded	OO
all	OO
of	OO
this	OO
information	OO
and	OO
tried	OO
to	OO
make	OO
human	OO
cardiovascular	OO
development	OO
happen	OO
in	OO
a	OO
dish	.O
it	OU
took	OO
us	OO
about	OO
five	OO
years	,O
but	OO
nowadays	,O
we	OO
can	OO
get	OO
90	OO
percent	OO
of	OO
our	OO
stem	OO
cells	OO
to	OO
turn	OO
into	OO
cardiac	OO
muscle	OO
—	OO
a	OO
900	OO
fold	OO
improvement	.O
so	OU
this	OO
was	OO
quite	OO
exciting	.O
this	OU
slide	OO
shows	OO
you	OO
our	OO
current	OO
cellular	OO
product	.O
we	OU
grow	OO
our	OO
heart	OO
muscle	OO
cells	OO
in	OO
little	OO
three	OO
dimensional	OO
clumps	OO
called	OO
cardiac	OO
organoids	.O
each	OU
of	OO
them	OO
has	OO
500	OO
to	OO
1,000	OO
heart	OO
muscle	OO
cells	OO
in	OO
it	.O
if	OU
you	OO
look	OO
closely	,O
you	OO
can	OO
see	OO
these	OO
little	OO
organoids	OO
are	OO
actually	OO
twitching;	OO
each	OO
one	OO
is	OO
beating	OO
independently	.O
but	OU
they've	OO
got	OO
another	OO
trick	OO
up	OO
their	OO
sleeve	.O
we	OU
took	OO
a	OO
gene	OO
from	OO
jellyfish	OO
that	OO
live	OO
in	OO
the	OO
pacific	OU
northwest	,U
and	OO
we	OO
used	OO
a	OO
technique	OO
called	OO
genome	OO
editing	OO
to	OO
splice	OO
this	OO
gene	OO
into	OO
the	OO
stem	OO
cells	.O
and	OU
this	OO
makes	OO
our	OO
heart	OO
muscle	OO
cells	OO
flash	OO
green	OO
every	OO
time	OO
they	OO
beat	.O
ok	,U
so	OO
now	OO
we	OO
were	OO
finally	OO
ready	OO
to	OO
begin	OO
animal	OO
experiments	.O
we	OU
took	OO
our	OO
cardiac	OO
muscle	OO
cells	OO
and	OO
we	OO
transplanted	OO
them	OO
into	OO
the	OO
hearts	OO
of	OO
rats	OO
that	OO
had	OO
been	OO
given	OO
experimental	OO
heart	OO
attacks	.O
a	OU
month	OO
later	,O
i	OU
peered	OO
anxiously	OO
down	OO
through	OO
my	OO
microscope	OO
to	OO
see	OO
what	OO
we	OO
had	OO
grown	,O
and	OO
i	OU
saw	.O
nothing	.O
everything	OU
had	OO
died	.O
but	OU
we	OO
persevered	OO
on	OO
this	,O
and	OO
we	OO
came	OO
up	OO
with	OO
a	OO
biochemical	OO
cocktail	OO
that	OO
we	OO
called	OO
our	OO
pro	OO
survival	OO
cocktail	,O
and	OO
this	OO
was	OO
enough	OO
to	OO
allow	OO
our	OO
cells	OO
to	OO
survive	OO
through	OO
the	OO
stressful	OO
process	OO
of	OO
transplantation	.O
and	OU
now	OO
when	OO
i	OU
looked	OO
through	OO
the	OO
microscope	,O
i	OU
could	OO
see	OO
this	OO
fresh	,O
young	,O
human	OO
heart	OO
muscle	OO
growing	OO
back	OO
in	OO
the	OO
injured	OO
wall	OO
of	OO
this	OO
rat's	OO
heart	.O
so	OU
this	OO
was	OO
getting	OO
quite	OO
exciting	.O
the	OU
next	OO
question	OO
was:	OO
will	OU
this	OO
new	OO
muscle	OO
beat	OO
in	OO
synchrony	OO
with	OO
the	OO
rest	OO
of	OO
the	OO
heart	?O
so	OU
to	OO
answer	OO
that	,O
we	OO
returned	OO
to	OO
the	OO
cells	OO
that	OO
had	OO
that	OO
jellyfish	OO
gene	OO
in	OO
them	.O
we	OU
used	OO
these	OO
cells	OO
essentially	OO
like	OO
a	OO
space	OO
probe	OO
that	OO
we	OO
could	OO
launch	OO
into	OO
a	OO
foreign	OO
environment	OO
and	OO
then	OO
have	OO
that	OO
flashing	OO
report	OO
back	OO
to	OO
us	OO
about	OO
their	OO
biological	OO
activity	.O
what	OU
you're	OO
seeing	OO
here	OO
is	OO
a	OO
zoomed	OO
in	OO
view	,O
a	OO
black	OO
and	OO
white	OO
image	OO
of	OO
a	OO
guinea	OO
pig's	OO
heart	OO
that	OO
was	OO
injured	OO
and	OO
then	OO
received	OO
three	OO
grafts	OO
of	OO
our	OO
human	OO
cardiac	OO
muscle	.O
so	OU
you	OO
see	OO
those	OO
sort	OO
of	OO
diagonally	OO
running	OO
white	OO
lines	.O
each	OU
of	OO
those	OO
is	OO
a	OO
needle	OO
track	OO
that	OO
contains	OO
a	OO
couple	OO
of	OO
million	OO
human	OO
cardiac	OO
muscle	OO
cells	OO
in	OO
it	.O
and	OU
when	OO
i	OU
start	OO
the	OO
video	,O
you	OO
can	OO
see	OO
what	OO
we	OO
saw	OO
when	OO
we	OO
looked	OO
through	OO
the	OO
microscope	.O
our	OU
cells	OO
are	OO
flashing	,O
and	OO
they're	OO
flashing	OO
in	OO
synchrony	,O
back	OO
through	OO
the	OO
walls	OO
of	OO
the	OO
injured	OO
heart	.O
what	OU
does	OO
this	OO
mean	?O
it	OU
means	OO
the	OO
cells	OO
are	OO
alive	,O
they're	OO
well	,O
they're	OO
beating	,O
and	OO
they've	OO
managed	OO
to	OO
connect	OO
with	OO
one	OO
another	OO
so	OO
that	OO
they're	OO
beating	OO
in	OO
synchrony	.O
but	OU
it	OO
gets	OO
even	OO
more	OO
interesting	OO
than	OO
this	.O
if	OU
you	OO
look	OO
at	OO
that	OO
tracing	OO
that's	OO
along	OO
the	OO
bottom	,O
that's	OO
the	OO
electrocardiogram	OO
from	OO
the	OO
guinea	OO
pig's	OO
own	OO
heart	.O
and	OU
if	OO
you	OO
line	OO
up	OO
the	OO
flashing	OO
with	OO
the	OO
heartbeat	OO
that's	OO
shown	OO
on	OO
the	OO
bottom	,O
what	OO
you	OO
can	OO
see	OO
is	OO
there's	OO
a	OO
perfect	OO
one	OO
to	OO
one	OO
correspondence	.O
in	OU
other	OO
words	,O
the	OO
guinea	OO
pig's	OO
natural	OO
pacemaker	OO
is	OO
calling	OO
the	OO
shots	,O
and	OO
the	OO
human	OO
heart	OO
muscle	OO
cells	OO
are	OO
following	OO
in	OO
lockstep	OO
like	OO
good	OO
soldiers	.O
our	OU
current	OO
studies	OO
have	OO
moved	OO
into	OO
what	OO
i	OU
think	OO
is	OO
going	OO
to	OO
be	OO
the	OO
best	OO
possible	OO
predictor	OO
of	OO
a	OO
human	OO
patient	,O
and	OO
that's	OO
into	OO
macaque	OO
monkeys	.O
this	OU
next	OO
slide	OO
shows	OO
you	OO
a	OO
microscopic	OO
image	OO
from	OO
the	OO
heart	OO
of	OO
a	OO
macaque	OO
that	OO
was	OO
given	OO
an	OO
experimental	OO
heart	OO
attack	OO
and	OO
then	OO
treated	OO
with	OO
a	OO
saline	OO
injection	.O
this	OU
is	OO
essentially	OO
like	OO
a	OO
placebo	OO
treatment	OO
to	OO
show	OO
the	OO
natural	OO
history	OO
of	OO
the	OO
disease	.O
the	OU
macaque	OO
heart	OO
muscle	OO
is	OO
shown	OO
in	OO
red	,O
and	OO
in	OO
blue	,O
you	OO
see	OO
the	OO
scar	OO
tissue	OO
that	OO
results	OO
from	OO
the	OO
heart	OO
attack	.O
so	OU
as	OO
you	OO
look	OO
as	OO
this	,O
you	OO
can	OO
see	OO
how	OO
there's	OO
a	OO
big	OO
deficiency	OO
in	OO
the	OO
muscle	OO
in	OO
part	OO
of	OO
the	OO
wall	OO
of	OO
the	OO
heart	.O
and	OU
it's	OO
not	OO
hard	OO
to	OO
imagine	OO
how	OO
this	OO
heart	OO
would	OO
have	OO
a	OO
tough	OO
time	OO
generating	OO
much	OO
force	.O
now	OU
in	OO
contrast	,O
this	OO
is	OO
one	OO
of	OO
the	OO
stem	OO
cell	OO
treated	OO
hearts	.O
again	,U
you	OO
can	OO
see	OO
the	OO
monkey's	OO
heart	OO
muscle	OO
in	OO
red	,O
but	OO
it's	OO
very	OO
hard	OO
to	OO
even	OO
see	OO
the	OO
blue	OO
scar	OO
tissue	,O
and	OO
that's	OO
because	OO
we've	OO
been	OO
able	OO
to	OO
repopulate	OO
it	OO
with	OO
the	OO
human	OO
heart	OO
muscle	,O
and	OO
so	OO
we've	OO
got	OO
this	OO
nice	,O
plump	OO
wall	.O
ok	,U
let's	OO
just	OO
take	OO
a	OO
second	OO
and	OO
recap	.O
i've	OU
showed	OO
you	OO
that	OO
we	OO
can	OO
take	OO
our	OO
stem	OO
cells	OO
and	OO
differentiate	OO
them	OO
into	OO
cardiac	OO
muscle	.O
we've	OU
learned	OO
how	OO
to	OO
keep	OO
them	OO
alive	OO
after	OO
transplantation	,O
we've	OO
showed	OO
that	OO
they	OO
beat	OO
in	OO
synchrony	OO
with	OO
the	OO
rest	OO
of	OO
the	OO
heart	,O
and	OO
we've	OO
shown	OO
that	OO
we	OO
can	OO
scale	OO
them	OO
up	OO
into	OO
an	OO
animal	OO
that	OO
is	OO
the	OO
best	OO
possible	OO
predictor	OO
of	OO
a	OO
human's	OO
response	.O
you'd	OU
think	OO
that	OO
we	OO
hit	OO
all	OO
the	OO
roadblocks	OO
that	OO
lay	OO
in	OO
our	OO
path	,O
right	?O
turns	OU
out	,O
not	.O
these	OU
macaque	OO
studies	OO
also	OO
taught	OO
us	OO
that	OO
our	OO
human	OO
heart	OO
muscle	OO
cells	OO
created	OO
a	OO
period	OO
of	OO
electrical	OO
instability	.O
they	OU
caused	OO
ventricular	OO
arrhythmias	,O
or	OO
irregular	OO
heartbeats	,O
for	OO
several	OO
weeks	OO
after	OO
we	OO
transplanted	OO
them	.O
this	OU
was	OO
quite	OO
unexpected	,O
because	OO
we	OO
hadn't	OO
seen	OO
this	OO
in	OO
smaller	OO
animals	.O
we've	OU
studied	OO
it	OO
extensively	,O
and	OO
it	OO
turns	OO
out	OO
that	OO
it	OO
results	OO
from	OO
the	OO
fact	OO
that	OO
our	OO
cellular	OO
graphs	OO
are	OO
quite	OO
immature	,O
and	OO
immature	OO
heart	OO
muscle	OO
cells	OO
all	OO
act	OO
like	OO
pacemakers	.O
so	OU
what	OO
happens	OO
is	,O
we	OO
put	OO
them	OO
into	OO
the	OO
heart	,O
and	OO
there	OO
starts	OO
to	OO
be	OO
a	OO
competition	OO
with	OO
the	OO
heart's	OO
natural	OO
pacemaker	OO
over	OO
who	OO
gets	OO
to	OO
call	OO
the	OO
shots	.O
it	OU
would	OO
be	OO
sort	OO
of	OO
like	OO
if	OO
you	OO
brought	OO
a	OO
whole	OO
gaggle	OO
of	OO
teenagers	OO
into	OO
your	OO
orderly	OO
household	OO
all	OO
at	OO
once	,O
and	OO
they	OO
don't	OO
want	OO
to	OO
follow	OO
the	OO
rules	OO
and	OO
the	OO
rhythms	OO
of	OO
the	OO
way	OO
you	OO
run	OO
things	,O
and	OO
it	OO
takes	OO
a	OO
while	OO
to	OO
rein	OO
everybody	OO
in	OO
and	OO
get	OO
people	OO
working	OO
in	OO
a	OO
coordinated	OO
fashion	.O
so	OU
our	OO
plans	OO
at	OO
the	OO
moment	OO
are	OO
to	OO
make	OO
the	OO
cells	OO
go	OO
through	OO
this	OO
troubled	OO
adolescence	OO
period	OO
while	OO
they're	OO
still	OO
in	OO
the	OO
dish	,O
and	OO
then	OO
we'll	OO
transplant	OO
them	OO
in	OO
in	OO
the	OO
post	OO
adolescent	OO
phase	,O
where	OO
they	OO
should	OO
be	OO
much	OO
more	OO
orderly	OO
and	OO
be	OO
ready	OO
to	OO
listen	OO
to	OO
their	OO
marching	OO
orders	.O
in	OU
the	OO
meantime	,O
it	OO
turns	OO
out	OO
we	OO
can	OO
actually	OO
do	OO
quite	OO
well	OO
by	OO
treating	OO
with	OO
anti	OO
arrhythmia	OO
drugs	OO
as	OO
well	.O
so	OU
one	OO
big	OO
question	OO
still	OO
remains	,O
and	OO
that	OO
is	,O
of	OO
course	,O
the	OO
whole	OO
purpose	OO
that	OO
we	OO
set	OO
out	OO
to	OO
do	OO
this:	OO
can	OU
we	OO
actually	OO
restore	OO
function	OO
to	OO
the	OO
injured	OO
heart	?O
to	OU
answer	OO
this	OO
question	,O
we	OO
went	OO
to	OO
something	OO
that's	OO
called	OO
left	OO
ventricular	OO
ejection	OO
fraction	.O
ejection	OU
fraction	OO
is	OO
simply	OO
the	OO
amount	OO
of	OO
blood	OO
that	OO
is	OO
squeezed	OO
out	OO
of	OO
the	OO
chamber	OO
of	OO
the	OO
heart	OO
with	OO
each	OO
beat	.O
now	,U
in	OO
healthy	OO
macaques	,O
like	OO
in	OO
healthy	OO
people	,O
ejection	OO
fractions	OO
are	OO
about	OO
65	OO
percent	.O
after	OU
a	OO
heart	OO
attack	,O
ejection	OO
fraction	OO
drops	OO
down	OO
to	OO
about	OO
40	OO
percent	,O
so	OO
these	OO
animals	OO
are	OO
well	OO
on	OO
their	OO
way	OO
to	OO
heart	OO
failure	.O
in	OU
the	OO
animals	OO
that	OO
receive	OO
a	OO
placebo	OO
injection	,O
when	OO
we	OO
scan	OO
them	OO
a	OO
month	OO
later	,O
we	OO
see	OO
that	OO
ejection	OO
fraction	OO
is	OO
unchanged	,O
because	OO
the	OO
heart	,O
of	OO
course	,O
doesn't	OO
spontaneously	OO
recover	.O
but	OU
in	OO
every	OO
one	OO
of	OO
the	OO
animals	OO
that	OO
received	OO
a	OO
graft	OO
of	OO
human	OO
cardiac	OO
muscle	OO
cells	,O
we	OO
see	OO
a	OO
substantial	OO
improvement	OO
in	OO
cardiac	OO
function	.O
this	OU
averaged	OO
eight	OO
points	,O
so	OO
from	OO
40	OO
to	OO
48	OO
percent	.O
what	OU
i	OU
can	OO
tell	OO
you	OO
is	OO
that	OO
eight	OO
points	OO
is	OO
better	OO
than	OO
anything	OO
that's	OO
on	OO
the	OO
market	OO
right	OO
now	OO
for	OO
treating	OO
patients	OO
with	OO
heart	OO
attacks	.O
it's	OU
better	OO
than	OO
everything	OO
we	OO
have	OO
put	OO
together	.O
so	OU
if	OO
we	OO
could	OO
do	OO
eight	OO
points	OO
in	OO
the	OO
clinic	,O
i	OU
think	OO
this	OO
would	OO
be	OO
a	OO

that	OU

two	OO

presuming	OU
these	OO

are	OO
safe	OO
and	OO
effective	,O
which	OO
i	OU
think	OO
they're	OO
going	OO

our	OO

is	OO
to	OO
scale	OO
this	OO
up	OO
and	OO
ship	OO
these	OO

all	OO
around	OO
the	OO
world	OO
for	OO
the	OO
treatment	OO
of	OO
patients	OO
with	OO
heart	OO
disease	.O
given	OU
the	OO
global	OO
burden	OO
of	OO
this	OO

i	OU
could	OO
easily	OO
imagine	OO
this	OO
treating	OO
a	OO
million	OO
or	OO
more	OO
patients	OO
a	OO
year	.O
so	OU
i	OU
envision	OO
a	OO
time	,O
maybe	OO
a	OO
decade	OO
from	OO
now	,O
where	OO
a	OO
patient	OO
like	OO
my	OO
mother	OO
will	OO
have	OO
actual	OO
treatments	OO
that	OO
can	OO
address	OO
the	OO
root	OO
cause	OO
and	OO
not	OO
just	OO
manage	OO
her	OO
symptoms	.O
this	OU
all	OO
comes	OO
from	OO
the	OO
fact	OO
that	OO
stem	OO
cells	OO
give	OO
us	OO
the	OO
ability	OO
to	OO
repair	OO
the	OO
human	OO
body	OO
from	OO
its	OO
component	OO
parts	.O
in	OU
the	OO
not	OO
too	OO
distant	OO
future	,O
repairing	OO
humans	OO
is	OO
going	OO
to	OO
go	OO
from	OO
something	OO
that	OO
is	OO
far	OO
fetched	OO
science	OO
fiction	OO
into	OO
common	OO
medical	OO
practice	.O
and	OU
when	OO
this	OO
happens	,O
it's	OO
going	OO
to	OO
have	OO
a	OO
transformational	OO

the	OO

one	OO

his	OO

over	OO
the	OO

that	OO

the	OO

of	OO
a	OO

which	OO
he	OO
finally	OO
achieved	OO
in	OO

so	OU
it	OO
was	OO
while	OO
reading	OO
from	OU
the	OO
earth	OU
to	OO
the	OO
moon	OU
and	OO
the	OU
war	OU
of	OO
the	OO

it	OO
was	OO
their	OO

their	OO

that	OO
inspired	OO
the	OO

the	OO

it's	OU
a	OO
culture	OO
that	OO

her	OU

the	OO

doesn't	OO

a	OO

out	,O
the	OO

the	OU

for	OU

a	OO

something	OO
as	OO

as	OO
a	OO

going	OO
out	.O
there	OU
are	OO

lots	OO
of	OO
things	OO
about	OO

that	OO
we	OO

in	OO
the	OO

but	OU
there	OO
is	OO
one	OO
thing	OO
i	OU
believe	OO
about	OO
space:	OO
space	OU
is	OO
trying	OO
to	OO
kill	OO
me	.O
space	OU
isn't	OO
out	OO
to	OO
get	OO
me	OO
personally	.O
it's	OU
also	OO
trying	OO
to	OO
kill	OO
you	OO
and	OO
everybody	OO
else	.O
think	OU
about	OO
it	.O
space	OU
doesn't	OO
naturally	OO
have	OO
what	OO
we	OO
need	OO
to	OO
survive	OO
when	OO
we	OO
travel	OO
there:	OO
no	OO
air	,O
it's	OO
too	OO
hot	OO
or	OO
too	OO
cold	,O
no	OO
ozone	OO
to	OO
protect	OO
us	OO
from	OO
those	OO
nasty	OO
uv	OU
rays	,O
either	.O
this	OU
all	OO
sounds	OO
bad	,O
but	OO
what	OO
can	OO
space	OO
really	OO
do	OO
to	OO
me	OO
if	OO
i	OU
stay	OO
on	OO
earth	?U
what	OU
we	OO
need	OO
to	OO
understand	OO
is	OO
that	OO
objects	OO
in	OO
space	OO
can	OO
cause	OO
people	OO
to	OO
think	OO
their	OO
days	OO
are	OO
numbered	,O
even	OO
when	OO
there	OO
are	OO
events	OO
on	OO
earth	OU
that	OO
can	OO
hurt	OO
or	OO
kill	OO
us	OO
before	OO
something	OO
from	OO
space	OO
does	.O
so	,U
what	OO
are	OO
the	OO
odds	OO
that	OO
one	OO
of	OO
these	OO
objects	OO
will	OO
really	OO
affect	OO
earth	OU
and	OO
you	OO
and	OO
me	OO
in	OO
our	OO
lifetime	?O
well	,U
we	OO
can	OO
take	OO
what	OO
we	OO
know	OO
about	OO
the	OO
universe	OO
to	OO
try	OO
and	OO
figure	OO
that	OO
out	.O
you	OU
might	OO
have	OO
heard	OO
stories	OO
about	OO
asteroids	OO
hitting	OO
the	OO
earth	.U
that	OU
would	OO
be	OO
pretty	OO
bad	.O
scientists	OU
think	OO
asteroids	OO
might	OO
have	OO
killed	OO
off	OO
most	OO
of	OO
the	OO
dinosaurs	.O
sounds	OU
like	OO
something	OO
we	OO
should	OO
worry	OO
about	,O
right	?O
well	,U
astronomers	OO
can	OO
now	OO
watch	OO
asteroids	OO
in	OO
space	OO
and	OO
see	OO
them	OO
coming	OO
using	OO
complex	OO
computer	OO
models	OO
to	OO
predict	OO
the	OO
deadly	OO
rock's	OO
path	.O
for	OU
a	OO
while	,O
the	OO
reported	OO
odds	OO
that	OO
asteroid	OO
apophis	OU
would	OO
strike	OO
earth	OU
in	OO
2036	OO
were	OO
once	OO
1	OO
in	OO
625	.O
but	,U
after	OO
updating	OO
their	OO
data	,O
astronomers	OO
now	OO
say	OO
the	OO
chances	OO
are	OO
extremely	OO
low	.O
okay	,U
what	OO
about	OO
the	OO
sun	?O
hollywood	OU
movies	OO
like	OO
to	OO
pick	OO
on	OO
our	OO
sun	OO
by	OO
showing	OO
earth	OU
destroyed	OO
by	OO
solar	OO
flares	OO
or	OO
the	OO
sun	OO
dying	OO
out	,O
which	OO
would	OO
cause	OO
earth	OU
to	OO
freeze	.O
astronomers	OU
predict	OO
our	OO
sun	OO
contains	OO
enough	OO
gas	OO
to	OO
make	OO
energy	OO
for	OO
another	OO
3	OO
to	OO
5	OO
billion	OO
years	.O
so	,U
in	OO
3	OO
to	OO
5	OO
billion	OO
years	,O
if	OO
people	OO
still	OO
exist	OO
on	OO
earth	,U
they'll	OO
have	OO
to	OO
deal	OO
with	OO
that	.O
but	OU
today	,O
well	,O
we're	OO
safe	.O
sometimes	OU
the	OO
sun	OO
does	OO
shoot	OO
flares	OO
at	OO
earth	,U
but	OO
the	OO
magnetic	OO
fields	OO
surrounding	OO
our	OO
planet	OO
blocks	OO
most	OO
of	OO
that	OO
radiation	.O
the	OU
radiation	OO
that	OO
does	OO
get	OO
through	OO
creates	OO
things	OO
like	OO
the	OO
aurora	OU
borealis	.U
gigantic	OU
solar	OO
flares	OO
can	OO
mess	OO
with	OO
our	OO
satellites	OO
and	OO
electrical	OO
equipment	,O
but	OO
the	OO
chances	OO
of	OO
it	OO
killing	OO
you	OO
are	OO
pretty	OO
slim	.O
okay	,U
what	OO
about	OO
that	OO
supermassive	OO
black	OO
hole	OO
in	OO
the	OO
middle	OO
of	OO
our	OO
galaxy	?O
what	OU
happens	OO
to	OO
earth	,U
and	OO
us	,O
when	OO
it	OO
pulls	OO
us	OO
in	?O
after	OU
all	,O
it	OO
is	OO
supermassive	.O
nope	,U
not	OO
going	OO
to	OO
happen	.O
that's	OU
one	OO
big	OO
object	OO
that	OO
can't	OO
bother	OO
us	.O
how	OU
can	OO
we	OO
be	OO
so	OO
sure	?O
our	OU
solar	OO
system	OO
is	OO
on	OO
the	OO
edge	OO
of	OO
the	OO
milky	OU
way	OU
while	OO
the	OO
nearest	OO
supermassive	OO
black	OO
hole	OO
is	OO
about	OO
26,000	OO
light	OO
years	OO
from	OO
earth	.U
that	OU
means	OO
we	OO
aren't	OO
on	OO
that	OO
black	OO
hole's	OO
menu	.O
so	,U
you	OO
still	OO
think	OO
space	OO
objects	OO
are	OO
trying	OO
to	OO
kill	OO
you	OO
even	OO
after	OO
what	OO
i've	OU
told	OO
you	OO
so	OO
far	?O
i	OU
think	OO
i've	OU
even	OO
convinced	OO
myself	OO
that	OO
odds	OO
are	OO
really	OO
good	OO
that	OO
space	OO
and	OO
the	OO
objects	OO
up	OO
there	OO
won't	OO
kill	OO
me	OO
after	OO
all	.O
but	OU
i'll	OU
probably	OO
keep	OO
looking	OO
up	OO
just	OO
to	OO
make	OO
sure	OO
nothing	OO
is	OO
headed	OO
my	OO
way	.O
every	OU
day	,O
a	OO
sea	OO
of	OO
decisions	OO
stretches	OO
before	OO
us	.O
some	OU
are	OO
small	OO
and	OO
unimportant	,O
but	OO
others	OO
have	OO
a	OO
larger	OO
impact	OO
on	OO
our	OO
lives	.O
for	OU
example	,O
which	OO
politician	OO
should	OO
i	OU
vote	OO
for	?O
should	OU
i	OU
try	OO
the	OO
latest	OO
diet	OO
craze	?O
or	OU
will	OO
email	OO
make	OO
me	OO
a	OO
millionaire	?O
we're	OU
bombarded	OO
with	OO
so	OO
many	OO
decisions	OO
that	OO
it's	OO
impossible	OO
to	OO
make	OO
a	OO
perfect	OO
choice	OO
every	OO
time	.O
but	OU
there	OO
are	OO
many	OO
ways	OO
to	OO
improve	OO
our	OO
chances	,O
and	OO
one	OO
particularly	OO
effective	OO
technique	OO
is	OO
critical	OO
thinking	.O
this	OU
is	OO
a	OO
way	OO
of	OO
approaching	OO
a	OO
question	OO
that	OO
allows	OO
us	OO
to	OO
carefully	OO
deconstruct	OO
a	OO
situation	,O
reveal	OO
its	OO
hidden	OO
issues	,O
such	OO
as	OO
bias	OO
and	OO
manipulation	,O
and	OO
make	OO
the	OO
best	OO
decision	.O
if	OU
the	OO
critical	OO
part	OO
sounds	OO
negative	OO
that's	OO
because	OO
in	OO
a	OO
way	OO
it	OO
is	.O
rather	OU
than	OO
choosing	OO
an	OO
answer	OO
because	OO
it	OO
feels	OO
right	,O
a	OO
person	OO
who	OO
uses	OO
critical	OO
thinking	OO
subjects	OO
all	OO
available	OO
options	OO
to	OO
scrutiny	OO
and	OO
skepticism	.O
using	OU
the	OO
tools	OO
at	OO
their	OO
disposal	,O
they'll	OO
eliminate	OO
everything	OO
but	OO
the	OO
most	OO
useful	OO
and	OO
reliable	OO
information	.O
there	OU
are	OO
many	OO
different	OO
ways	OO
of	OO
approaching	OO
critical	OO
thinking	,O
but	OO
here's	OO
one	OO
five	OO
step	OO
process	OO
that	OO
may	OO
help	OO
you	OO
solve	OO
any	OO
number	OO
of	OO
problems	.O
one:	OU
formulate	OO
your	OO
question	.O
in	OU
other	OO
words	,O
know	OO
what	OO
you're	OO
looking	OO
for	.O
this	OU
isn't	OO
always	OO
as	OO
straightforward	OO
as	OO
it	OO
sounds	.O
for	OU
example	,O
if	OO
you're	OO
deciding	OO
whether	OO
to	OO
try	OO
out	OO
the	OO
newest	OO
diet	OO
craze	,O
your	OO
reasons	OO
for	OO
doing	OO
so	OO
may	OO
be	OO
obscured	OO
by	OO
other	OO
factors	,O
like	OO
claims	OO
that	OO
you'll	OO
see	OO
results	OO
in	OO
just	OO
two	OO
weeks	.O
but	OU
if	OO
you	OO
approach	OO
the	OO
situation	OO
with	OO
a	OO
clear	OO
view	OO
of	OO
what	OO
you're	OO
actually	OO
trying	OO
to	OO
accomplish	OO
by	OO
dieting	,O
whether	OO
that's	OO
weight	OO
loss	,O
better	OO
nutrition	,O
or	OO
having	OO
more	OO
energy	,O
that'll	OO
equip	OO
you	OO
to	OO
sift	OO
through	OO
this	OO
information	OO
critically	,O
find	OO
what	OO
you're	OO
looking	OO
for	,O
and	OO
decide	OO
whether	OO
the	OO
new	OO
fad	OO
really	OO
suits	OO
your	OO
needs	.O
two:	OU
gather	OO
your	OO
information	.O
there's	OU
lots	OO
of	OO
it	OO
out	OO
there	,O
so	OO
having	OO
a	OO
clear	OO
idea	OO
of	OO
your	OO
question	OO
will	OO
help	OO
you	OO
determine	OO
what's	OO
relevant	.O
if	OU
you're	OO
trying	OO
to	OO
decide	OO
on	OO
a	OO
diet	OO
to	OO
improve	OO
your	OO
nutrition	,O
you	OO
may	OO
ask	OO
an	OO
expert	OO
for	OO
their	OO
advice	,O
or	OO
seek	OO
other	OO
people's	OO
testimonies	.O
information	OU
gathering	OO
helps	OO
you	OO
weigh	OO
different	OO
options	,O
moving	OO
you	OO
closer	OO
to	OO
a	OO
decision	OO
that	OO
meets	OO
your	OO
goal	.O
three:	OU
apply	OO
the	OO
information	,O
something	OO
you	OO
do	OO
by	OO
asking	OO
critical	OO
questions	.O
facing	OU
a	OO
decision	,O
ask	OO
yourself	,O
what	OU
concepts	OO
are	OO
at	OO
work	?O
what	OU
assumptions	OO
exist	?O
is	OU
my	OO
interpretation	OO
of	OO
the	OO
information	OO
logically	OO
sound	?O
for	OU
example	,O
in	OO
an	OO
email	OO
that	OO
promises	OO
you	OO
millions	,O
you	OO
should	OO
consider	,O
what	OU
is	OO
shaping	OO
my	OO
approach	OO
to	OO
this	OO
situation	?O
do	OU
i	OU
assume	OO
the	OO
sender	OO
is	OO
telling	OO
the	OO
truth	?O
based	OU
on	OO
the	OO
evidence	,O
is	OO
it	OO
logical	OO
to	OO
assume	OO
i'll	OU
win	OO
any	OO
money	?O
four:	OU
consider	OO
the	OO
implications	.O
imagine	OU
it's	OO
election	OO
time	,O
and	OO
you've	OO
selected	OO
a	OO
political	OO
candidate	OO
based	OO
on	OO
their	OO
promise	OO
to	OO
make	OO
it	OO
cheaper	OO
for	OO
drivers	OO
to	OO
fill	OO
up	OO
on	OO
gas	.O
at	OU
first	OO
glance	,O
that	OO
seems	OO
great	.O
but	OU
what	OO
about	OO
the	OO
long	OO
term	OO
environmental	OO
effects	?O
if	OU
gasoline	OO
use	OO
is	OO
less	OO
restricted	OO
by	OO
cost	,O
this	OO
could	OO
also	OO
cause	OO
a	OO
huge	OO
surge	OO
in	OO
air	OO
pollution	,O
an	OO
unintended	OO
consequence	OO
that's	OO
important	OO
to	OO
think	OO
about	.O
five:	OU
explore	OO
other	OO
points	OO
of	OO
view	.O
ask	OU
yourself	OO
why	OO
so	OO
many	OO
people	OO
are	OO
drawn	OO
to	OO
the	OO
policies	OO
of	OO
the	OO
opposing	OO
political	OO
candidate	.O
even	OU
if	OO
you	OO
disagree	OO
with	OO
everything	OO
that	OO
candidate	OO
says	,O
exploring	OO
the	OO
full	OO
spectrum	OO
of	OO
viewpoints	OO
might	OO
explain	OO
why	OO
some	OO
policies	OO
that	OO
don't	OO
seem	OO
valid	OO
to	OO
you	OO
appeal	OO
to	OO
others	.O
this	OU
will	OO
allow	OO
you	OO
to	OO
explore	OO
alternatives	,O
evaluate	OO
your	OO
own	OO
choices	,O
and	OO
ultimately	OO
help	OO
you	OO
make	OO
more	OO
informed	OO
decisions	.O
this	OU
five	OO
step	OO
process	OO
is	OO
just	OO
one	OO
tool	,O
and	OO
it	OO
certainly	OO
won't	OO
eradicate	OO
difficult	OO
decisions	OO
from	OO
our	OO
lives	.O
but	OU
it	OO
can	OO
help	OO
us	OO
increase	OO
the	OO
number	OO
of	OO
positive	OO
choices	OO
we	OO
make	.O
critical	OU
thinking	OO
can	OO
give	OO
us	OO
the	OO
tools	OO
to	OO
sift	OO
through	OO
a	OO
sea	OO
of	OO
information	OO
and	OO
find	OO
what	OO
we're	OO
looking	OO
for	.O
and	OU
if	OO
enough	OO
of	OO
us	OO
use	OO
it	,O
it	OO
has	OO
the	OO
power	OO
to	OO
make	OO
the	OO
world	OO
a	OO
more	OO
reasonable	OO
place	.O
if	OU
someone	OO
called	OO
you	OO
scum	,O
you'd	OO
probably	OO
be	OO
offended	,O
but	OO
scientifically	,O
they	OO
might	OO
not	OO
be	OO
far	OO
off	.O
have	OU
you	OO
ever	OO
thought	OO
about	OO
where	OO
your	OO
food	OO
comes	OO
from	?O
you	OU
might	OO
say	OO
it	OO
comes	OO
from	OO
plants	,O
animals	,O
or	OO
even	OO
fungi	,O
but	OO
you'd	OO
probably	OO
rather	OO
not	OO
think	OO
about	OO
the	OO
rotting	OO
organisms	OO
and	OO
poop	OO
that	OO
feed	OO
those	OO
plants	,O
animals	,O
and	OO
fungi	.O
so	OU
really	,O
you	OO
and	OO
most	OO
of	OO
the	OO
matter	OO
in	OO
your	OO
body	OO
are	OO
just	OO
two	OO
or	OO
three	OO
degrees	OO
of	OO
separation	OO
from	OO
things	OO
like	OO
pond	OO
scum	.O
all	OU
species	OO
in	OO
an	OO
ecosystem	,O
from	OO
the	OO
creatures	OO
in	OO
a	OO
coral	OO
reef	OO
to	OO
the	OO
fish	OO
in	OO
a	OO
lake	OO
to	OO
the	OO
lions	OO
on	OO
the	OO
savannah	,O
are	OO
directly	OO
or	OO
indirectly	OO
nourished	OO
by	OO
dead	OO
stuff	.O
most	OU
of	OO
the	OO

when	OU
we	OO
watch	OO
a	OO
film	OO
or	OO
a	OO

we	OO
know	OO
that	OO
the	OO
actors	OO
probably	OO
learned	OO
their	OO
lines	OO
from	OO
a	OO
script	,O
which	OO
essentially	OO
tells	OO
them	OO
what	OO
to	OO
say	OO
and	OO
when	OO
to	OO
say	OO
it	.O
a	OU
piece	OO
of	OO
written	OO
music	OO
operates	OO
on	OO
exactly	OO
the	OO
same	OO
principle	.O
in	OU
a	OO
very	OO
basic	OO
sense	,O
it	OO
tells	OO
a	OO
performer	OO
what	OO
to	OO
play	OO
and	OO
when	OO
to	OO
play	OO
it	.O
aesthetically	OU
speaking	,O
there's	OO
a	OO
world	OO
of	OO
difference	OO
between	,O
say	,O
beethoven	OU
and	OO
justin	OU
bieber	,U
but	OO
both	OO
artists	OO
have	OO
used	OO
the	OO
same	OO
building	OO
blocks	OO
to	OO
create	OO
their	OO
music:	OO
notes	.O
and	OU
although	OO
the	OO
end	OO
result	OO
can	OO
sound	OO
quite	OO
complicated	,O
the	OO
logic	OO
behind	OO
musical	OO
notes	OO
is	OO
actually	OO
pretty	OO
straightforward	.O
let's	OU
take	OO
a	OO
look	OO
at	OO
the	OO
foundational	OO
elements	OO
to	OO
music	OO
notation	OO
and	OO
how	OO
they	OO
interact	OO
to	OO
create	OO
a	OO
work	OO
of	OO
art	.O
music	OU
is	OO
written	OO
on	OO
five	OO
parallel	OO
lines	OO
that	OO
go	OO
across	OO
the	OO
page	.O
these	OU
five	OO
lines	OO
are	OO
called	OO
a	OO
staff	,O
and	OO
a	OO
staff	OO
operates	OO
on	OO
two	OO
axes:	OO
up	OO
and	OO
down	OO
and	OO
left	OO
to	OO
right	.O
the	OU
up	OO
and	OO
down	OO
axis	OO
tells	OO
the	OO
performer	OO
the	OO
pitch	OO
of	OO
the	OO
note	OO
or	OO
what	OO
note	OO
to	OO
play	,O
and	OO
the	OO
left	OO
to	OO
right	OO
axis	OO
tells	OO
the	OO
performer	OO
the	OO
rhythm	OO
of	OO
the	OO
note	OO
or	OO
when	OO
to	OO
play	OO
it	.O
let's	OU
start	OO
with	OO
pitch	.O
to	OU
help	OO
us	OO
out	,O
we're	OO
going	OO
to	OO
use	OO
a	OO
piano	,O
but	OO
this	OO
system	OO
works	OO
for	OO
pretty	OO
much	OO
any	OO
instrument	OO
you	OO
can	OO
think	OO
of	.O
in	OU
the	OO
western	OU
music	OO
tradition	,O
pitches	OO
are	OO
named	OO
after	OO
the	OO
first	OO
seven	OO
letters	OO
of	OO
the	OO
alphabet	,O
a	,U
b	,U
c	,U
d	,U
e	,U
f	,U
and	OO
g	.U
after	OU
that	,O
the	OO
cycle	OO
repeats	OO
itself:	OO
a	,U
b	,U
c	,U
d	,U
e	,U
f	,U
g	,U
a	,U
b	,U
c	,U
d	,U
e	,U
f	,U
g	,U
and	OO
so	OO
on	.O
but	OU
how	OO
do	OO
these	OO
pitches	OO
get	OO
their	OO
names	?O
well	,U
for	OO
example	,O
if	OO
you	OO
played	OO
an	OO
f	OU
and	OO
then	OO
played	OO
another	OO
f	OU
higher	OO
or	OO
lower	OO
on	OO
the	OO
piano	,O
you'd	OO
notice	OO
that	OO
they	OO
sound	OO
pretty	OO
similar	OO
compared	OO
to	,O
say	,O
a	OO
b	.U
going	OU
back	OO
to	OO
the	OO
staff	,O
every	OO
line	OO
and	OO
every	OO
space	OO
between	OO
two	OO
lines	OO
represents	OO
a	OO
separate	OO
pitch	.O
if	OU
we	OO
put	OO
a	OO
note	OO
on	OO
one	OO
of	OO
these	OO
lines	OO
or	OO
one	OO
of	OO
these	OO
spaces	,O
we're	OO
telling	OO
a	OO
performer	OO
to	OO
play	OO
that	OO
pitch	.O
the	OU
higher	OO
up	OO
on	OO
the	OO
staff	OO
a	OO
note	OO
is	OO
placed	,O
the	OO
higher	OO
the	OO
pitch	.O
but	OU
there	OO
are	OO
obviously	OO
many	,O
many	OO
more	OO
pitches	OO
than	OO
the	OO
nine	OO
that	OO
these	OO
lines	OO
and	OO
spaces	OO
gives	OO
us	.O
a	OU
grand	OO
piano	,O
for	OO
example	,O
can	OO
play	OO
88	OO
separate	OO
notes	.O
so	OU
how	OO
do	OO
we	OO
condense	OO
88	OO
notes	OO
onto	OO
a	OO
single	OO
staff	?O
we	OU
use	OO
something	OO
called	OO
a	OO
clef	,O
a	OO
weird	OO
looking	OO
figure	OO
placed	OO
at	OO
the	OO
beginning	OO
of	OO
the	OO
staff	,O
which	OO
acts	OO
like	OO
a	OO
reference	OO
point	,O
telling	OO
you	OO
that	OO
a	OO
particular	OO
line	OO
or	OO
space	OO
corresponds	OO
to	OO
a	OO
specific	OO
note	OO
on	OO
your	OO
instrument	.O
if	OU
we	OO
want	OO
to	OO
play	OO
notes	OO
that	OO
aren't	OO
on	OO
the	OO
staff	,O
we	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
cheat	OO
and	OO
draw	OO
extra	OO
little	OO
lines	OO
called	OO
ledger	OO
lines	OO
and	OO
place	OO
the	OO
notes	OO
on	OO
them	.O
if	OU
we	OO
have	OO
to	OO
draw	OO
so	OO
many	OO
ledger	OO
lines	OO
that	OO
it	OO
gets	OO
confusing	,O
then	OO
we	OO
need	OO
to	OO
change	OO
to	OO
a	OO
different	OO
clef	.O
as	OU
for	OO
telling	OO
a	OO
performer	OO
when	OO
to	OO
play	OO
the	OO
notes	,O
two	OO
main	OO
elements	OO
control	OO
this:	OO
the	OO
beat	OO
and	OO
the	OO
rhythm	.O
the	OU
beat	OO
of	OO
a	OO
piece	OO
of	OO
music	OO
is	,O
by	OO
itself	,O
kind	OO
of	OO
boring	.O
it	OU
sounds	OO
like	OO
this	.O
notice	OU
that	OO
it	OO
doesn't	OO
change	,O
it	OO
just	OO
plugs	OO
along	OO
quite	OO
happily	.O
it	OU
can	OO
go	OO
slow	OO
or	OO
fast	OO
or	OO
whatever	OO
you	OO
like	,O
really	.O
the	OU
point	OO
is	OO
that	OO
just	OO
like	OO
the	OO
second	OO
hand	OO
on	OO
a	OO
clock	OO
divides	OO
one	OO
minute	OO
into	OO
sixty	OO
seconds	,O
with	OO
each	OO
second	OO
just	OO
as	OO
long	OO
as	OO
every	OO
other	OO
second	,O
the	OO
beat	OO
divides	OO
a	OO
piece	OO
of	OO
music	OO
into	OO
little	OO
fragments	OO
of	OO
time	OO
that	OO
are	OO
all	OO
the	OO
same	OO
length:	OO
beats	.O
with	OU
a	OO
steady	OO
beat	OO
as	OO
a	OO
foundation	,O
we	OO
can	OO
add	OO
rhythm	OO
to	OO
our	OO
pitches	,O
and	OO
that's	OO
when	OO
music	OO
really	OO
starts	OO
to	OO
happen	.O
this	OU
is	OO
a	OO
quarter	OO
note	.O
it's	OU
the	OO
most	OO
basic	OO
unit	OO
of	OO
rhythm	,O
and	OO
it's	OO
worth	OO
one	OO
beat	.O
this	OU
is	OO
a	OO
half	OO
note	,O
and	OO
it's	OO
worth	OO
two	OO
beats	.O
this	OU
whole	OO
note	OO
here	OO
is	OO
worth	OO
four	OO
beats	,O
and	OO
these	OO
little	OO
guys	OO
are	OO
eighth	OO
notes	,O
worth	OO
half	OO
a	OO
beat	OO
each	.O
great	,U
you	OO
say	,O
what	OO
does	OO
that	OO
mean	?O
you	OU
might	OO
have	OO
noticed	OO
that	OO
across	OO
the	OO
length	OO
of	OO
a	OO
staff	,O
there	OO
are	OO
little	OO
lines	OO
dividing	OO
it	OO
into	OO
small	OO
sections	.O
these	OU
are	OO
bar	OO
lines	OO
and	OO
we	OO
refer	OO
to	OO
each	OO
section	OO
as	OO
a	OO
bar	.O
at	OU
the	OO
beginning	OO
of	OO
a	OO
piece	OO
of	OO
music	,O
just	OO
after	OO
the	OO
clef	,O
is	OO
something	OO
called	OO
the	OO
time	OO
signature	,O
which	OO
tells	OO
a	OO
performer	OO
how	OO
many	OO
beats	OO
are	OO
in	OO
each	OO

this	OU
says	OO
there	OO
are	OO
two	OO

in	OO
each	OO

this	OO

there	OO
are	OO
three	,O
this	OO
one	OO
four	,O
and	OO
so	OO
on	.O
the	OU
bottom	OO
number	OO
tells	OO
us	OO
what	OO
kind	OO
of	OO

is	OO
to	OO
be	OO
used	OO
as	OO
the	OO
basic	OO
unit	OO
for	OO
the	OO

one	OU

to	OO
a	OO
whole	OO

two	OO
to	OO
a	OO
half	OO
note	,O
four	OO
to	OO
a	OO
quarter	OO
note	,O
and	OO
eight	OO
to	OO
an	OO
eighth	OO
note	,O
and	OO
so	OO
on	.O
so	OU
this	OO
time	OO
signature	OO
here	OO
tells	OO
us	OO
that	OO
there	OO
are	OO
four	OO
quarter	OO
notes	OO
in	OO
each	OO

one	,O
two	,O
three	,O
four;	OO
one	,O
two	,O
three	,O
four	,O
and	OO
so	OO
on	.O
but	OU
like	OO
i	OU
said	OO
before	,O
if	OO
we	OO
just	OO
stick	OO
to	OO
the	OO
beat	,O
it	OO
gets	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
boring	,O
so	OO
we'll	OO
replace	OO
some	OO
quarter	OO
notes	OO
with	OO
different	OO
rhythms	.O
notice	OU
that	OO
even	OO
though	OO
the	OO
number	OO
of	OO
notes	OO
in	OO
each	OO
bar	OO
has	OO
changed	,O
the	OO
total	OO
number	OO
of	OO
beats	OO
in	OO
each	OO
bar	OO
hasn't	.O
so	,U
what	OO
does	OO
our	OO
musical	OO
creation	OO
sound	OO
like	?O
eh	,U
sounds	OO
okay	,O
but	OO
maybe	OO
a	OO
bit	OO
thin	,O
right	?O
let's	OU
add	OO
another	OO
instrument	OO
with	OO
its	OO
own	OO
pitch	OO
and	OO
rhythm	.O
now	OU
it's	OO
sounding	OO
like	OO
music	.O
sure	,U
it	OO
takes	OO
some	OO
practice	OO
to	OO
get	OO
used	OO
to	OO
reading	OO
it	OO
quickly	OO
and	OO
playing	OO
what	OO
we	OO
see	OO
on	OO
our	OO
instrument	,O
but	,O
with	OO
a	OO
bit	OO
of	OO
time	OO
and	OO
patience	,O
you	OO
could	OO
be	OO
the	OO
next	OO
beethoven	OU
or	OO

one	OO
of	OO
the	OO

of	OO

but	OO
he's	OO
most	OO
famous	OO
for	OO
something	OO
he	OO
never	OO
actually	OO
did:	OO
a	OO
thought	OO
experiment	OO
involving	OO
a	OO
cat	.O
he	OU
imagined	OO
taking	OO
a	OO
cat	OO
and	OO
placing	OO
it	OO
in	OO
a	OO
sealed	OO
box	OO
with	OO
a	OO
device	OO
that	OO
had	OO
a	OO
50%	OO
chance	OO
of	OO
killing	OO
the	OO
cat	OO
in	OO
the	OO
next	OO
hour	.O
at	OU
the	OO
end	OO
of	OO
that	OO
hour	,O
he	OO
asked	,O
what	OU
is	OO
the	OO
state	OO
of	OO
the	OO
cat	?O
common	OU
sense	OO
suggests	OO
that	OO
the	OO
cat	OO
is	OO
either	OO
alive	OO
or	OO
dead	,O
but	OO
schrödinger	OU
pointed	OO
out	OO
that	OO
according	OO
to	OO

physics	,O
at	OO
the	OO
instant	OO
before	OO
the	OO
box	OO
is	OO
opened	,O
the	OO

is	OO
equal	OO

at	OO
the	OO

time	.O
it's	OU
only	OO
when	OO
the	OO

that	OO
we	OO
see	OO
a	OO

the	OO

is	OO
a	OO
blur	OO
of	OO
probability	,O
half	OO
one	OO

and	OO
half	OO
the	OO

this	OU
seems	OO
absurd	,O
which	OO
was	OO
schrödinger's	OU
point	.O
he	OU
found	OO

so	OO

that	OO

be	OU

and	OU
most	OO
likely	,O
this	OO
is	OO
what	OO
you	OO
think	OO
when	OO
you	OO
hear	OO
it:	OO
if	OU
only	OO
it	OO
were	OO
that	OO
simple	.O
but	OU
what	OO
is	OO
confidence	?O
take	OU
the	OO
belief	OO
that	OO
you	OO
are	OO
valuable	,O
worthwhile	,O
and	OO
capable	,O
also	OO
known	OO
as	OO

the	OO

that	OO

so	OU
where	OO

confidence	OO
even	OO
come	OO
from	?O
there	OU
are	OO
several	OO

that	OO
impact	OO

one:	OU
what	OO
you're	OO
born	OO
with	,O
such	OO
as	OO
your	OO

which	OO
will	OO
impact	OO
things	OO
like	OO
the	OO

two:	OU
how	OO
you're	OO
treated	.O
this	OU
includes	OO
the	OO
social	OO

of	OO
your	OO

and	OU
three:	OO
the	OO
part	OO
you	OO
have	OO
control	OO
over	,O
the	OO
choices	OO
you	OO

the	OO

it	OU

these	OO

the	OO

a	OO

role	OO
in	OO

a	OO

to	OO
improve	.O
if	OU
you're	OO
looking	OO
for	OO
a	OO
long	OO

consider	OO
the	OO
way	OO
you	OO

about	OO
your	OO
abilities	OO

do	OU
you	OO
think	OO
they	OO

or	OO
that	OO
they	OO
can	OO
be	OO
developed	,O
like	OO

these	OU

how	OO
you	OO

when	OO
you're	OO

with	OO

if	OU

your	OO

we	OU

clearly	OO
identify	OO

as	OO
a	OO
whole	,O
most	OO
importantly	,O
its	OO

which	OO
is	OO
the	OO

but	OU
we	OO

it	OO
a	OO

it	OU
has	OO
a	OO
good	OO
probability	OO
of	OO
being	OO
in	OO
lots	OO
of	OO

places	.O
wavelength	OU
is	OO
essential	OO
for	OO
quantum	OO
physics	OO
because	OO
an	OO
object's	OO
wavelength	OO
is	OO
related	OO
to	OO
its	OO

mass	OO
times	OO

a	OU
fast	OO

which	OO

a	OU

lots	OO
of	OO

even	OO
if	OO

not	OO
moving	OO
very	OO
fast	,O
which	OO
again	OO
means	OO
a	OO
very	OO
short	OO

this	OU
is	OO
why	OO
we	OO
don't	OO
notice	OO
the	OO

nature	OO
of	OO
everyday	OO
objects	.O
if	OU
you	OO
toss	OO
a	OO
baseball	OO
up	OO
in	OO
the	OO
air	,O
its	OO

a	OO
billionth	OO

a	OO

a	OO

small	OU
things	,O

though	,O

have	OO
wavelengths	OO
big	OO
enough	OO
to	OO

so	,U
if	OO
we	OO

a	OO
pure	OO
wave	,O
we	OO
can	OO
measure	OO
its	OO
wavelength	,O
and	OO

its	OO

but	OO
it	OO
has	OO
no	OO
position	.O
we	OU
can	OO
know	OO
a	OO
particles	OO
position	OO
very	OO
well	,O
but	OO
it	OO
doesn't	OO
have	OO
a	OO

so	OO
we	OO
don't	OO
know	OO
its	OO
momentum	.O
to	OU
get	OO
a	OO
particle	OO
with	OO
both	OO
position	OO
and	OO

we	OO
need	OO
to	OO
mix	OO
the	OO

make	OO
a	OO
graph	OO
that	OO

how	OU

we	OO
do	OO
this	?O
by	OU
combining	OO

in	OO

it's	OO

a	OO

what	OO
is	OO

really	,O
and	OO
how	OO
much	OO

we	OO
worry	OO
about	OO
its	OO

the	OU
answer	OO
begins	OO
with	OO
understanding	OO
that	OO
the	OO
word	OO
radiation	OO
describes	OO
two	OO
very	OO
different	OO
scientific	OO
phenomena:	OO
electromagnetic	OO

electromagnetic	OU
radiation	OO

pure	OO

at	OU
the	OO

modern	OU

a	OU

known	OO

radiation	,O
to	OO
achieve	OO
greater	OO
stability	.O
nuclear	OU
radiation	OO
comes	OO
from	OO
natural	OO

how	OO

a	OO

now	,U
one	OO
of	OO
the	OO
things	OO
we	OO
were	OO
very	OO
interested	OO
in	OO
was	OO
the	OO
surface	OO

of	OO

or	OO
the	OO
thin	,O

on	OO
the	OO

of	OO
the	OO
brain	OO
that	OO
does	OO
most	OO
of	OO
the	OO
cognitive	OO
heavy	OO
lifting	.O
and	OU
that's	OO
because	OO
past	OO
work	OO
by	OO
other	OO
scientists	OO
has	OO
suggested	OO
that	OO
in	OO
many	OO
cases	,O
a	OO
larger	OO
cortical	OO
surface	OO
area	OO
is	OO
often	OO
associated	OO
with	OO
higher	OO
intelligence	.O
now	,U
in	OO
this	OO
study	,O
we	OO
found	OO
one	OO
factor	OO
that	OO
was	OO
associated	OO
with	OO
the	OO
cortical	OO
surface	OO
area	OO
across	OO
nearly	OO
the	OO
entire	OO
surface	OO
of	OO
the	OO
brain	.O
that	OU
factor	OO
was	OO
family	OO
income	.O
now	,U
here	,O
every	OO
point	OO
you	OO
see	OO
in	OO
color	OO
is	OO
a	OO
point	OO
where	OO
higher	OO
family	OO
income	OO
was	OO
associated	OO
with	OO
a	OO
larger	OO
cortical	OO
surface	OO
area	OO
in	OO
that	OO
spot	.O
and	OU
there	OO
were	OO
some	OO
regions	,O
shown	OO
here	OO
in	OO
yellow	,O
where	OO
that	OO
association	OO
was	OO
particularly	OO
pronounced	.O
and	OU
those	OO
are	OO
regions	OO
that	OO
we	OO
know	OO
support	OO
a	OO
certain	OO
set	OO
of	OO
cognitive	OO
skills:	OO
language	OO
skills	OO
like	OO
vocabulary	OO
and	OO
reading	OO
as	OO
well	OO
as	OO
the	OO
ability	OO
to	OO
avoid	OO
distraction	OO
and	OO
exert	OO
self	OO
control	.O
and	OU
that's	OO
important	,O
because	OO
those	OO
are	OO
the	OO
very	OO
skills	OO
that	OO
children	OO
living	OO
in	OO
poverty	OO
are	OO
most	OO
likely	OO
to	OO
struggle	OO
with	.O
in	OU
fact	,O
a	OO
child	OO
living	OO
with	OO
poverty	OO
is	OO
likely	OO
to	OO
perform	OO
worse	OO
on	OO
tests	OO
of	OO

and	OO
impulse	OO
control	OO
before	OO
they	OO
even	OO
turn	OO
two	.O
now	,U
there	OO
are	OO
a	OO
few	OO
points	OO
i'd	OU
like	OO
to	OO
highlight	OO
about	OO
this	OO
study	.O
number	OU
one:	OO
this	OO
link	OO
between	OO
family	OO
income	OO
and	OO
children's	OO
brain	OO
structure	OO
was	OO
strongest	OO
at	OO
the	OO
lowest	OO
income	OO
levels	.O
so	OU
that	OO
means	OO
that	OO
dollar	OO
for	OO
dollar	,O
relatively	OO
small	OO
differences	OO
in	OO
family	OO
income	OO
were	OO
associated	OO
with	OO
proportionately	OO
greater	OO
differences	OO
in	OO
brain	OO
structure	OO
among	OO
the	OO
most	OO
disadvantaged	OO
families	.O
and	OU
intuitively	,O
that	OO
makes	OO
sense	,O
right	?O
an	OU
extra	OO
20,000	OO
dollars	OO
for	OO
a	OO
family	OO
earning	,O
say	,O
150,000	OO
dollars	OO
a	OO
year	OO
would	OO
certainly	OO
be	OO
nice	,O
but	OO
probably	OO
not	OO
game	OO
changing	,O
whereas	OO
an	OO
extra	OO
20,000	OO
dollars	OO
for	OO
a	OO
family	OO
only	OO
earning	OO
20,000	OO
dollars	OO
a	OO
year	OO
would	OO
likely	OO
make	OO
a	OO
remarkable	OO
difference	OO
in	OO
their	OO
day	OO
to	OO
day	OO
lives	.O
now	,U
the	OO
second	OO
point	OO
i'd	OU
like	OO
to	OO
highlight	OO
is	OO
that	OO
this	OO
link	OO
between	OO
family	OO
income	OO
and	OO
children's	OO
brain	OO
structure	OO
didn't	OO
depend	OO
on	OO
the	OO
children's	OO
age	,O
it	OO
didn't	OO
depend	OO
on	OO
their	OO
sex	OO
and	OO
it	OO
didn't	OO
depend	OO
on	OO
their	OO
race	OO
or	OO
ethnicity	.O
and	OU
the	OO
final	OO
point	OO
—	OO
and	OO
this	OO
one's	OO
key	OO
—	OO
there	OO
was	OO
tremendous	OO
variability	OO
from	OO
one	OO
child	OO
to	OO
the	OO
next	,O
by	OO
which	OO
i	OU
mean	OO
there	OO
were	OO
plenty	OO
of	OO
children	OO
from	OO
higher	OO
income	OO
homes	OO
with	OO
smaller	OO
brain	OO
surfaces	OO
and	OO
plenty	OO
of	OO
children	OO
from	OO
lower	OO
income	OO
homes	OO
with	OO
larger	OO
brain	OO
surfaces	.O
here's	OU
an	OO
analogy	.O
we	OU
all	OO
know	OO
that	OO
in	OO
childhood	,O
boys	OO
tend	OO
to	OO
be	OO
taller	OO
than	OO
girls	,O
but	OO
go	OO
into	OO
any	OO
elementary	OO
school	OO
classroom	,O
and	OO
you'll	OO
find	OO
some	OO
girls	OO
who	OO
are	OO
taller	OO
than	OO
some	OO
boys	.O
so	OU
while	OO
growing	OO
up	OO
in	OO
poverty	OO
is	OO
certainly	OO
a	OO
risk	OO
factor	OO
for	OO
a	OO
smaller	OO
brain	OO
surface	,O
in	OO
no	OO
way	OO
can	OO
i	OU
know	OO
an	OO
individual	OO
child's	OO
family	OO
income	OO
and	OO
know	OO
with	OO
any	OO
accuracy	OO
what	OO
that	OO
particular	OO
child's	OO
brain	OO
would	OO
look	OO
like	.O
i	OU
want	OO
you	OO
to	OO
imagine	,O
for	OO
a	OO
moment	,O
two	OO
children	.O
one	OU
is	OO
a	OO
young	OO
child	OO
born	OO
into	OO
poverty	OO
in	OO
america;	OU
the	OO
other	OO
is	OO
also	OO
an	OO
american	OU
child	,O
but	OO
one	OO
who	OO
was	OO
born	OO
into	OO
more	OO
fortunate	OO
circumstances	.O
now	,U
at	OO
birth	,O
we	OO
find	OO
absolutely	OO
no	OO
differences	OO
in	OO
how	OO
their	OO
brains	OO
work	.O
but	OU
by	OO
the	OO
time	OO
those	OO
two	OO
kids	OO
are	OO
ready	OO
to	OO
start	OO
kindergarten	,O
we	OO
know	OO
that	OO
the	OO
child	OO
living	OO
in	OO
poverty	OO
is	OO
likely	OO
to	OO
have	OO
cognitive	OO
scores	OO
that	OO
are	,O
on	OO

60	OO
percent	OO
lower	OO
than	OO
those	OO
of	OO
the	OO
other	OO
child	.O
later	OU
on	,O
that	OO
child	OO
living	OO
in	OO
poverty	OO
will	OO
be	OO
five	OO
times	OO
more	OO
likely	OO
to	OO
drop	OO
out	OO
of	OO
high	OO
school	,O
and	OO
if	OO
she	OO
does	OO
graduate	OO
high	OO

she'll	OO
be	OO
less	OO
likely	OO
to	OO
earn	OO
a	OO
college	OO
degree	.O
by	OU
the	OO
time	OO
those	OO
two	OO
kids	OO
are	OO
35	OO
years	OO
old	,O
if	OO
the	OO
first	OO

spent	OO
her	OO
entire	OO

living	OO
in	OO
poverty	,O
she	OO
is	OO
up	OO
to	OO
75	OO
times	OO
more	OO
likely	OO
to	OO
be	OO
poor	OO
herself	.O
but	OU
it	OO
doesn't	OO

to	OO
be	OO
that	OO
way	.O
as	OU
a	OO
neuroscientist	,O
one	OO
of	OO
things	OO

exciting	OO
about	OO
the	OO

that	OO
our	OO

now	,U
this	OO

that	OO

and	OU
if	OO
a	OO
child's	OO
brain	OO
can	OO
be	OO
changed	,O
then	OO
anything	OO
is	OO
possible	.O
as	OU
a	OO
society	,O
we	OO
spend	OO
billions	OO
of	OO
dollars	OO
each	OO
year	,O
educating	OO
our	OO
children	.O
so	OU
what	OO
can	OO
we	OO
tell	OO
schools	,O
teachers	OO
and	OO
parents	OO
who	OO
want	OO
to	OO
help	OO
support	OO
kids	OO
from	OO
disadvantaged	OO
backgrounds	OO
to	OO
do	OO
their	OO
best	OO
in	OO
school	OO
and	OO
in	OO
life	?O
well	,U
emerging	OO
science	OO
suggests	OO
that	OO
growing	OO
up	OO
in	OO
poverty	OO
is	OO
associated	OO
with	OO
a	OO
host	OO
of	OO
different	OO
experiences	OO
and	OO
that	OO
these	OO
experiences	OO
in	OO
turn	OO
may	OO
work	OO
together	OO
to	OO
help	OO
shape	OO
brain	OO
development	OO
and	OO
ultimately	OO
help	OO
kids	OO
learn	.O
and	OU
so	OO
if	OO
this	OO
is	OO
right	,O
it	OO
begs	OO
the	OO
question:	OO
where	OU
along	OO
this	OO
pathway	OO
can	OO
we	OO
step	OO
in	OO
and	OO
provide	OO
help	?O
so	OU
let's	OO
consider	OO
first	OO
intervening	OO
at	OO
the	OO
level	OO
of	OO
learning	OO
itself	OO
—	OO
most	OO
commonly	OO
through	OO
school	OO
based	OO
initiatives	.O
now	,U
should	OO
we	OO
be	OO
encouraging	OO
teachers	OO
to	OO
focus	OO
on	OO
the	OO
kinds	OO
of	OO
skills	OO
that	OO
disadvantaged	OO
kids	OO
are	OO
most	OO
likely	OO
to	OO
struggle	OO
with	?O
of	OU
course	.O
the	OU
importance	OO
of	OO
high	OO
quality	OO
education	OO
based	OO
in	OO
scientific	OO
evidence	OO
really	OO
can't	OO
be	OO
overstated	.O
and	OU
there	OO
are	OO
a	OO
number	OO
of	OO
examples	OO
of	OO
excellent	OO
interventions	OO
targeting	OO
things	OO
like	OO
literacy	OO
or	OO
self	OO
regulation	OO
that	OO
do	OO
in	OO
fact	OO
improve	OO
kids'	OO
cognitive	OO
development	OO
and	OO
their	OO
test	OO
scores	.O
but	OU
as	OO
any	OO
intervention	OO
scientist	OO
doing	OO
this	OO
work	OO
would	OO
tell	OO
you	,O
this	OO
work	OO
is	OO
challenging	.O
it's	OU
hard	OO
to	OO
implement	OO
high	OO
quality	,O
evidence	OO
based	OO
education	.O
and	OU
it	OO
can	OO
be	OO
labor	OO
intensive	,O
it's	OO
sometimes	OO
costly	.O
and	OU
in	OO
many	OO
cases	,O
these	OO
disparities	OO
in	OO
child	OO
development	OO
emerge	OO
early	OO
—	OO
well	OO
before	OO
the	OO
start	OO
of	OO
formal	OO
schooling	OO
—	OO
sometimes	OO
when	OO
kids	OO
are	OO
just	OO
toddlers	.O
and	OU
so	OO
i	OU
would	OO
argue:	OO
school	OO
is	OO
very	OO
important	,O
but	OO
if	OO
we're	OO
focusing	OO
all	OO
of	OO
our	OO
policy	OO
efforts	OO
on	OO
formal	OO
schooling	,O
we're	OO
probably	OO
starting	OO
too	OO
late	.O
so	OU
what	OO
about	OO
taking	OO
a	OO
step	OO
back	OO
and	OO
focusing	OO
on	OO
trying	OO
to	OO
change	OO
children's	OO
experiences	?O
what	OU
particular	OO
experiences	OO
are	OO
associated	OO
with	OO
growing	OO
up	OO
in	OO
poverty	OO
and	OO
might	OO
be	OO
able	OO
to	OO
be	OO
targeted	OO
to	OO
promote	OO
brain	OO
development	OO
and	OO
learning	OO
outcomes	OO
for	OO
kids	?O
of	OU
course	,O
there	OO
are	OO
many	,O
right	?O
nutrition	,U
access	OO
to	OO
health	OO
care	,O
exposure	OO
to	OO
second	OO
hand	OO
smoke	OO
or	OO
lead	,O
experience	OO
of	OO
stress	OO
or	OO
discrimination	,O
to	OO
name	OO
a	OO
few	.O
in	OU
my	OO
laboratory	,O
we're	OO
particularly	OO
focused	OO
on	OO
a	OO
few	OO
types	OO
of	OO
experiences	OO
that	OO
we	OO
believe	OO
may	OO
be	OO
able	OO
to	OO
be	OO
targeted	OO
to	OO
promote	OO
children's	OO
brain	OO
development	OO
and	OO
ultimately	OO
improve	OO
their	OO

as	OU
one	OO
example	,O
take	OO
something	OO
i'll	OU
call	OO
the	OO
home	OO
language	OO
environment	,O
by	OO
which	OO
i	OU
mean	,O
we	OO
know	OO
that	OO
the	OO
number	OO
of	OO
words	OO
kids	OO
hear	OO
and	OO
the	OO
number	OO
of	OO
conversations	OO
they're	OO
engaged	OO
in	OO
every	OO
day	OO
can	OO
vary	OO
tremendously	.O
by	OU
some	OO
estimates	,O
kids	OO
from	OO
more	OO
advantaged	OO
backgrounds	OO
hear	OO
an	OO
average	OO
of	OO
30	OO
million	OO
more	OO
spoken	OO
words	OO
in	OO
the	OO
first	OO
few	OO
years	OO
of	OO
life	OO
compared	OO
to	OO
kids	OO
from	OO
less	OO
advantaged	OO
backgrounds	.O
now	,U
in	OO
our	OO
work	,O
we're	OO
finding	OO
that	OO
kids	OO
who	OO
experience	OO
more	OO
back	OO
and	OO
forth	,O
responsive	OO
conversational	OO
turns	OO
tend	OO
to	OO
have	OO
a	OO
larger	OO
brain	OO
surface	OO
in	OO
parts	OO
of	OO
the	OO
brain	OO
that	OO
we	OO
know	OO
are	OO
responsible	OO
for	OO
language	OO
and	OO
reading	OO
skills	.O
and	OU
in	OO
fact	,O
the	OO
number	OO
of	OO
conversations	OO
they	OO
hear	OO
seems	OO
to	OO
matter	OO
a	OO
little	OO
bit	OO
more	OO
than	OO
the	OO
sheer	OO
number	OO
of	OO
words	OO
they	OO
hear	.O
so	OU
one	OO
tantalizing	OO
possibility	OO
is	OO
that	OO
we	OO
should	OO
be	OO
teaching	OO
parents	OO
not	OO
just	OO
to	OO
talk	OO
a	OO
lot	,O
but	OO
to	OO
actually	OO
have	OO
more	OO
conversations	OO
with	OO
their	OO
children	.O
in	OU
this	OO
way	,O
it's	OO
possible	OO
that	OO
we'll	OO
promote	OO
brain	OO
development	OO
and	OO
perhaps	OO
their	OO
kids'	OO
language	OO
and	OO
reading	OO
skills	.O
and	OU
in	OO
fact	,O
a	OO
number	OO
of	OO
scientists	OO
are	OO
testing	OO
that	OO
exciting	OO
possibility	OO
right	OO
now	.O
but	OU
of	OO
course	,O
we	OO
all	OO
know	OO
that	OO
growing	OO
up	OO
in	OO
poverty	OO
is	OO
associated	OO
with	OO
lots	OO
of	OO
different	OO
experiences	OO
beyond	OO
just	OO
how	OO
many	OO
conversations	OO
kids	OO
are	OO
having	.O
so	OU
how	OO
do	OO
we	OO
choose	OO
what	OO
else	OO
to	OO
focus	OO
on	?O
the	OU
list	OO
can	OO
be	OO
overwhelming	.O
there	OU
are	OO
a	OO
number	OO
of	OO
high	OO
quality	OO
interventions	OO
that	OO
do	OO
try	OO
to	OO
change	OO
children's	OO
experience	,O
many	OO
of	OO
which	OO
are	OO
quite	OO
effective	.O
but	OU
again	,O
just	OO
like	OO
school	OO
based	OO
initiatives	,O
this	OO
is	OO
hard	OO
work	.O
it	OU
can	OO
be	OO
challenging	,O
it	OO
can	OO
be	OO
labor	OO
intensive	,O
sometimes	OO
costly	.O
and	OO
on	OO
occasion	,O
it	OO
can	OO
be	OO
somewhat	OO
patronizing	OO
for	OO
scientists	OO
to	OO
swoop	OO
in	OO
and	OO
tell	OO
a	OO
family	OO
what	OO
they	OO
need	OO
to	OO
change	OO
in	OO
order	OO
for	OO
their	OO
child	OO
to	OO
succeed	.O
so	OU
i	OU
want	OO
to	OO
share	OO
an	OO
idea	OO
with	OO
you	.O
what	OU
if	OO
we	OO
tried	OO
to	OO
help	OO
young	OO
children	OO
in	OO
poverty	OO
by	OO
simply	OO
giving	OO
their	OO
families	OO
more	OO
money	?O
i'm	OU
privileged	OO
to	OO
be	OO
working	OO
with	OO
a	OO
team	OO
of	OO
economists	,O
social	OO
policy	OO
experts	OO
and	OO
neuroscientists	OO
in	OO
leading	OO
baby's	OU
first	OU
years	,U
the	OO
first	OO
ever	OO
randomized	OO
study	OO
to	OO
test	OO
whether	OO
poverty	OO
reduction	OO
causes	OO
changes	OO
in	OO
children's	OO
brain	OO
development	.O
now	,U
the	OO
ambition	OO
of	OO
the	OO
study	OO
is	OO
large	,O
but	OO
the	OO
premise	OO
is	OO
actually	OO
quite	OO
simple	.O
in	OU
may	OU
of	OO
2018	,O
we	OO
began	OO
recruiting	OO
1,000	OO
mothers	OO
living	OO
below	OO
the	OO
federal	OO
poverty	OO
line	OO
shortly	OO
after	OO
they	OO
gave	OO
birth	OO
in	OO
a	OO
number	OO
of	OO
american	OU
hospitals	.O
upon	OU
enrolling	OO
in	OO
our	OO
study	,O
all	OO
mothers	OO
receive	OO
an	OO
unconditional	OO
monthly	OO
cash	OO
gift	OO
for	OO
the	OO
first	OO
40	OO
months	OO
of	OO
their	OO
children's	OO
lives	,O
and	OO
they're	OO
free	OO
to	OO
use	OO
this	OO
money	OO
however	OO
they	OO
like	.O
but	OU
importantly	,O
mothers	OO
are	OO
being	OO
randomized	,O
so	OO
some	OO
mothers	OO
are	OO
randomized	OO
to	OO
receive	OO
a	OO
nominal	OO
monthly	OO
cash	OO
gift	OO
and	OO
others	OO
are	OO
randomized	OO
to	OO
receive	OO
several	OO
hundred	OO
dollars	OO
each	OO
month	,O
an	OO
amount	OO
that	OO
we	OO
believe	OO
is	OO
large	OO
enough	OO
to	OO
make	OO
a	OO
difference	OO
in	OO
their	OO
day	OO
to	OO
day	OO
lives	,O
in	OO
most	OO
cases	OO
increasing	OO
their	OO
monthly	OO
income	OO
by	OO
20	OO
to	OO
25	OO
percent	.O
so	OU
in	OO
this	OO
way	,O
we're	OO
hoping	OO
to	OO
finally	OO
move	OO
past	OO
questions	OO
of	OO
how	OO
poverty	OO
is	OO
correlated	OO
with	OO
child	OO
development	OO
and	OO
actually	OO
be	OO
able	OO
to	OO
test	OO
whether	OO
reducing	OO
poverty	OO
causes	OO
changes	OO
in	OO
children's	OO
cognitive	,O
emotional	OO
and	OO
brain	OO
development	OO
in	OO
the	OO
first	OO
three	OO
years	OO
of	OO
life	OO
—	OO
the	OO
very	OO
time	OO
when	OO
we	OO
believe	OO
the	OO
developing	OO
brain	OO
may	OO
be	OO
most	OO
malleable	OO
to	OO
experience	.O
now	,U
we	OO
won't	OO
have	OO
definitive	OO
results	OO
from	OO
this	OO
study	OO
for	OO
several	OO
years	,O
and	OO
if	OO
nothing	OO
else	,O
1,000	OO
newborns	OO
and	OO
their	OO
moms	OO
will	OO
have	OO
a	OO
bit	OO
more	OO
cash	OO
each	OO
month	OO
that	OO
they	OO
tell	OO
us	OO
they	OO
very	OO
much	OO
need	.O
but	OU
what	OO
if	OO
it	OO
turns	OO
out	OO
that	OO
a	OO
cost	OO
effective	OO
way	OO
to	OO
help	OO
young	OO
children	OO
in	OO
poverty	OO
is	OO
to	OO
simply	OO
give	OO
their	OO
moms	OO
more	OO
money	?O
if	OU
our	OO
hypotheses	OO
are	OO
borne	OO
out	,O
it's	OO
our	OO
hope	OO
that	OO
results	OO
from	OO
this	OO
work	OO
will	OO
inform	OO
debates	OO
about	OO
social	OO
services	OO
that	OO
have	OO
the	OO
potential	OO
to	OO
effect	OO
millions	OO
of	OO

with	OO
young	OO

because	OU
while	OO

the	OO
only	OO
or	OO
even	OO
the	OO
most	OO
important	OO
factor	OO
in	OO
determining	OO
children's	OO
brain	OO
development	,O
it	OO
may	OO
be	OO
one	OO
that	,O
from	OO
a	OO
policy	OO
perspective	,O
can	OO
be	OO
easily	OO
addressed	.O
put	OU
simply	,O
if	OO
we	OO
can	OO
show	OO
that	OO
reducing	OO
poverty	OO
changes	OO
how	OO
children's	OO
brains	OO
develop	OO
and	OO
that	OO
leads	OO
to	OO
meaningful	OO
policy	OO

then	OO
a	OO

what	OO

for	OO
what	OO

out	OO
to	OO
be	OO
a	OO
million	OO
people	OO
on	OO
the	OO
street	.O
it	OU
was	OO
our	OO
first	OO
show	.O
it	OU
was	OO
our	OO
first	OO
show	,O
and	OO
it	OO
changed	OO
the	OO
nature	OO
of	OO
the	OO
appreciation	OO
of	OO

not	OO
in	OO
a	OO
gallery	,O
not	OO
in	OO
a	OO

not	OO
in	OO
an	OO
opera	OO
house	,O
but	OO
live	OO
and	OO
on	OO
the	OO
streets	,O
transforming	OO
public	OO
space	OO
for	OO
the	OO
broadest	OO
possible	OO
audience	,O
people	OO
who	OO
would	OO
never	OO
buy	OO
a	OO
ticket	OO
to	OO
see	OO
anything	.O
so	OU
there	OO
we	OO
were	.O
we'd	OU
finished	,O
and	OO
we've	OO
continued	OO
to	OO
produce	OO
work	OO
of	OO
this	OO
kind	.O
as	OU
you	OO
can	OO
see	,O
the	OO
company's	OO
work	OO
is	OO
astonishing	,O
but	OO
what's	OO
also	OO
astonishing	OO
is	OO
the	OO
fact	OO
that	OO
permission	OO
was	OO
granted	.O
and	OU
you	OO
don't	OO
see	OO
any	OO
security	.O
and	OU
this	OO
was	OO
nine	OO
months	OO
after	OO
terrible	OO
terrorist	OO
bombings	OO
that	OO
had	OO
ripped	OO
london	OU
apart	.O
so	OU
i	OU
began	OO
to	OO
wonder	OO
whether	OO
it	OO
was	OO
possible	OO
to	OO
do	OO
this	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
stuff	OO
in	OO
even	OO
more	OO
complicated	OO
circumstances	.O
we	OU
turned	OO
our	OO
attention	OO
to	OO
northern	OU
ireland	,U
the	OO
north	OU
of	OO
ireland	,U
depending	OO
on	OO
your	OO
point	OO
of	OO
view	.O
this	OU
is	OO
a	OO
map	OO
of	OO
england	,U
scotland	,U
wales	OU
and	OO
ireland	,U
the	OO
island	OO
to	OO
the	OO
left	.O
for	OU
generations	,O
it's	OO
been	OO
a	OO
place	OO
of	OO
conflict	,O
the	OO
largely	OO
catholic	OU
republic	OO
in	OO
the	OO
south	OO
and	OO
the	OO
largely	OO
protestant	OU
loyalist	OO
community	OO
—	OO
hundreds	OO
of	OO
years	OO
of	OO
conflict	,O
british	OU
troops	OO
on	OO
the	OO
streets	OO
for	OO
over	OO
30	OO
years	.O
and	OU
now	,O
although	OO
there	OO
is	OO
a	OO
peace	OO
process	,O
this	OO
is	OO
today	OO
in	OO
this	OO
city	,O
called	OO
londonderry	OU
if	OO
you're	OO
a	OO
loyalist	,O
called	OO
derry	OU
if	OO
you're	OO
a	OO
catholic	.U
but	OU
everybody	OO
calls	OO
it	OO
home	.O
and	OU
i	OU
began	OO
to	OO
wonder	OO
whether	OO
there	OO
was	OO
a	OO
way	OO
in	OO
which	OO
the	OO
community	OO
tribalism	OO
could	OO
be	OO
addressed	OO
through	OO
art	OO
and	OO
the	OO
imagination	.O
this	OU
is	OO
what	OO
the	OO
communities	OO
do	,O
every	OO
summer	,O
each	OO
community	.O
this	OU
is	OO
a	OO
bonfire	OO
filled	OO
with	OO
effigies	OO
and	OO
insignia	OO
from	OO
the	OO
people	OO
that	OO
they	OO
hate	OO
on	OO
the	OO
other	OO
side	.O
this	OU
is	OO
the	OO
same	OO
from	OO
the	OO
loyalist	OO
community	.O
and	OU
every	OO
summer	,O
they	OO
burn	OO
them	.O
they're	OU
right	OO
in	OO
the	OO
center	OO
of	OO
town	.O
so	OU
we	OO
turned	OO
to	OO
here	,O
to	OO
the	OO
nevada	OU
desert	,O
to	OO
burning	OU
man	,U
where	OO
people	OO
also	OO
do	OO
bonfires	,O
but	OO
with	OO
a	OO
completely	OO
different	OO
set	OO
of	OO
values	.O
here	OU
you	OO
see	OO
the	OO
work	OO
of	OO
david	OU
best	OU
and	OO
his	OO
extraordinary	OO
temples	,O
which	OO
are	OO
built	OO
during	OO
the	OO
burning	OU
man	OU
event	OO
and	OO
then	OO
incinerated	OO
on	OO
the	OO
sunday	.U
so	OU
we	OO
invited	OO
him	OO
and	OO
his	OO
community	OO
to	OO
come	,O
and	OO
we	OO
recruited	OO
from	OO
both	OO
sides	OO
of	OO
the	OO
political	OO
and	OO
religious	OO
divide:	OO
young	OO
people	,O
unemployed	OO
people	,O
people	OO
who	OO
would	OO
never	OO
normally	OO
come	OO
across	OO
each	OO
other	OO
or	OO
speak	OO
to	OO
each	OO
other	.O
and	OU
out	OO
of	OO
their	OO
extraordinary	OO
work	OO
rose	OO
a	OO
temple	OO
to	OO
rival	OO
the	OO
two	OO
cathedrals	OO
that	OO
exist	OO
in	OO
the	OO
town	,O
one	OO
catholic	OU
and	OO
one	OO
protestant	.U
but	OU
this	OO
was	OO
a	OO
temple	OO
to	OO
no	OO
religion	,O
for	OO
everyone	,O
for	OO
no	OO
community	,O
but	OO
for	OO
everyone	.O
and	OU
we	OO
put	OO
it	OO
in	OO
this	OO
place	OO
where	OO
everyone	OO
told	OO
me	OO
nobody	OO
would	OO
come	.O
it	OU
was	OO
too	OO
dangerous	.O
it	OU
sat	OO
between	OO
two	OO
communities	.O
i	OU
just	OO
kept	OO
saying	,O
but	OU
it's	OO
got	OO
such	OO
a	OO
great	OO
view	.O
and	OU
again	,O
that	OO
same	OO
old	OO
question:	OO
why	OU
wouldn't	OO
we	OO
do	OO
this	?O
what	OU
you	OO
see	OO
in	OO
the	OO
picture	OO
is	OO
the	OO
beginning	OO
of	OO
426	OO
primary	OO
school	OO
children	OO
who	OO
were	OO
walked	OO
up	OO
the	OO
hill	OO
by	OO
the	OO
head	OO
teacher	,O
who	OO
didn't	OO
want	OO
them	OO
to	OO
lose	OO
this	OO
opportunity	.O
and	OU
just	OO
as	OO
happens	OO
in	OO
the	OO
nevada	OU
desert	,O
though	OO
in	OO
slightly	OO
different	OO
temperatures	,O
the	OO
people	OO
of	OO
this	OO
community	,O
65,000	OO
of	OO
them	,O
turned	OO
out	OO
to	OO
write	OO
their	OO
grief	,O
their	OO
pain	,O
their	OO
hope	,O
their	OO
hopes	OO
for	OO
the	OO
future	,O
their	OO
love	.O
because	OU
in	OO
the	OO
end	,O
this	OO
is	OO
only	OO
about	OO
love	.O
they	OU
live	OO
in	OO
a	OO
post	OO
conflict	OO
society:	OO
lots	OO
of	OO
post	OO
traumatic	OO
stress	,O
high	OO
suicide	.O
and	OU
yet	,O
for	OO
this	OO
brief	OO
moment	OO
—	OO
and	OO
it	OO
would	OO
be	OO
ridiculous	OO
to	OO
assume	OO
that	OO
it	OO
was	OO
more	OO
than	OO
that	OO
—	OO
somebody	OO
like	OO
kevin	OU
—	OO
a	OO
catholic	OU
whose	OO
father	OO
was	OO
shot	OO
when	OO
he	OO
was	OO
nine	,O

the	OO

who	OO
came	OO
through	OO
the	OO

on	OO
the	OO
day	OO
we	OO
opened	OO
the	OO
temple	OO
to	OO
the	OO
public	.O
it	OU
rose	OO
up	.O
it	OU
sat	OO
there	OO
for	OO
five	OO
days	.O
and	OU
then	OO
we	OO
chose	OO
—	OO
from	OO
our	OO
little	OO
tiny	OO
band	OO
of	OO
nonsectarian	OO
builders	,O
who	OO

for	OO
this	OO
period	OO

this	OO

chose	OO
from	OO
them	OO
the	OO
people	OO
who	OO
would	OO
incinerate	OO
it	.O
and	OU
here	OO
you	OO

the	OO
moment	OO
when	,O

15,000	OO
people	OO
who	OO
turned	OO
out	OO
on	OO
a	OO
dark	,O

the	OO

you	OU

you	.O

this	OO

what’s	OO

that	OO

that	OO

we	OO

that	OO

by	OO

certain	OU

it's	OU

the	OO

that	OO

let's	OU
go	OO
back	OO
to	OO

if	OU
a	OO

it	OO
ultimately	OO
has	OO
a	OO

on	OO
your	OO

if	OO
they	OO

the	OO

the	OU
two	OO

of	OO
the	OO

are	OO
ultimately	OO
quite	OO

overall	,U
behaviors	OO
that	OO

your	OU

considering	OO

what	OU
was	OO
right	OO
in	OO
hawaii	OU
was	OO
far	OO
from	OO
right	OO
in	OO

we	OU
desperately	OO
looked	OO
for	OO
a	OO

that	OO

then	OU
eventually	OO
we	OO

by	OO

the	OO
reality	OO

that	OO

'can't	OO
the	OO

'to	OO

at	OU

about	OO

that	OO

what	OO
doctors	OO

started	OO
to	OO
notice	.O
there	OU

a	OO
child	OO
who	OO

screaming	OO
in	OO

when	OO

the	OO

another	OU
kid	OO
who	OO
wouldn’t	OO
move	OO
at	OO
all	OO
due	OO
to	OO
pain	OO
after	OO
surgery	OO
suddenly	OO
got	OO
up	OO
just	OO
because	OO
they	OO
wanted	OO
to	OO
see	OO
bailey	.U
that	OU
was	OO
a	OO
big	OO
surprise	OO
to	OO
the	OO
doctor	.O
a	OU
family	,O
who	OO
are	OO
suddenly	OO

nothing	OO

people	OO
cannot	OO
suppress	OO
their	OO
feelings	OO
for	OO

sometimes	OU
it	OO
is	OO
important	OO
to	OO
cry	.O
with	OU
somebody	OO
who	OO
is	OO
human	,O
they	OO
would	OO
feel	OO
a	OO
need	OO
'to	OO

to	OO
bailey	,U
they	OO
never	OO
have	OO
to	OO
say	OO
anything	OO
if	OO
they	OO
do	OO
not	OO

to	.O
i	OU
saw	OO
a	OO
mother	OO
in	OO
a	OO
hospital	OO
corridor	,O
after	OO
hugging	OO
bailey	,U
crying	OO
as	OO
she	OO

with	OO
a	OO
relaxed	OO

she	OO
went	OO
back	OO

her	OO
kid's	OO

bailey	OU
was	OO
a	OO
positive	OO
influence	OO
for	OO
their	OO

too	.O
then	OU
i	OU
found	OO
there	OO
are	OO
three	OO
important	OO
bonds	OO
for	OO
a	OO
facility	OO
dog	.O
one	OU
is	OO
a	OO
bond	OO
between	OO
bailey	OU
and	OO
the	OO
kids	,O
another	OO
is	OO
bailey	OU
and	OO
his	OO
handler	,O
and	OO
the	OO
other	OO
is	OO
bailey	OU
and	OO
the	OO
medical	OO
staff	.O
these	OU
are	OO
three	OO
important	OO
bonds	OO
with	OO
bailey	.U
the	OU
first	OO
bond	OO
is:	OO
as	OO
bailey	OU
works	OO
at	OO
the	OO
same	OO
hospital	OO
everyday	,O
he	OO
sees	OO
the	OO
same	OO
children	OO
many	OO
times	.O
for	OU
children	,O
just	OO
having	OO
a	OO
dog	OO
is	OO
not	OO
good	OO
enough	.O
bailey	,U
who	OO
comes	OO
to	OO
them	OO
everyday	,O
really	OO
matters	.O
only	OU
with	OO
bailey	OU
who	OO
has	OO
bonds	OO
with	OO
the	OO
kids	,O
can	OO
they	OO
be	OO
courageous	OO
enough	OO
to	OO
hang	OO
in	OO
there	.O
even	OU
with	OO
a	OO
dog	OO
phobia	,O
almost	OO
all	OO
kids	OO
will	OO
come	OO
to	OO
like	OO
bailey	OU
eventually	.O
for	OU
kids	,O
bailey	OU
is	OO
a	OO
teammate	OO
with	OO
a	OO
tail	OO
who	OO
fight	OO
against	OO
their	OO
illness	.O
bailey	OU
can	OO
even	OO
enter	OO
the	OO
surgical	OO
theatre	OO
with	OO
a	OO
child	.O
even	OU
an	OO
adult	OO
is	OO
scared	OO
of	OO
getting	OO
an	OO
operation	,O
right	?O
wondering	OU
'does	OO
it	OO
hurt?'	,O
or	OO
feeling	OO
scared	,O
they	OO
have	OO
to	OO
spend	OO
the	OO
terrifying	OO
time	OO
from	OO
the	OO
ward	OO
to	OO
the	OO
theatre	.O
but	OU
holding	OO
bailey's	OU
leash	,O
walking	OO
with	OO
him	,O
children	OO
can	OO
guide	OO
bailey	OU
smiling	OO
and	OO
walking	OO
to	OO
the	OO
theatre	.O
it	OU
is	OO
a	OO
privilege	OO
walk	OO
with	OO
everyone's	OO
favourite	OO
bailey	,U
without	OO
anyone	OO
else	.O
some	OU
kids	OO
walk	OO
playfully	OO
around	OO
bailey's	OU
fluffy	OO
tail	OO
as	OO
if	OO
they	OO
are	OO
cats	.O
some	OU
kids	OO
say	OO
smiling	,O
'bailey's	OO
wagging	OO
his	OO
tail	OO
means	OO
good	OU
luck'	.U
in	OU
this	OO
way	,O
scary	OO
feelings	OO
turn	OO
to	OO
exciting	OO
feelings;	OO
which	OO
encourages	OO
kids	OO
to	OO
go	OO
to	OO
the	OO
theatre	.O
the	OU
second	OO
bond	OO
is:	OO
between	OO
a	OO
facility	OO
dog	OO
and	OO
their	OO
hander	,O
who	OO
live	OO
together	OO
twenty	OO
four	OO
seven	.O
we	OU
always	OO
spend	OO
holidays	OO
together	OO
too	.O
this	OU
is	OO
very	OO
important;	OO
just	OO
getting	OO
together	OO
while	OO
working	OO
and	OO
saying	OO
'bye	OO
bye'	OU
after	OO
five	OO
doesn't	OO
make	OO
any	OO
sense	.O
we	OU
sleep	OO
at	OO
night	OO
and	OO
bailey	OU
sleeps	OO
with	OO
his	OO
head	OO
on	OO
my	OO
arm	.O
the	OU
bond	OO
between	OO
a	OO
facility	OO
dog	OO
and	OO
their	OO
handler	OO
is	OO
the	OO
basis	OO
on	OO
which	OO
a	OO
facility	OO
dog	OO
works	OO
professionally	.O
only	OU
the	OO
bond	OO
with	OO
me	OO
can	OO
convince	OO
bailey	OU
to	OO
trust	OO
me	OO
to	OO
work	OO
together	.O
but	OU
the	OO
truth	OO
is;	OO
you	OO
may	OO
think	OO
that	OO
a	OO
training	OO
dog	OO
will	OO
do	OO
anything	OO
i	OU
say	,O
bailey	OU
is	OO
a	OO
stubborn	OO
guy	OO
who	OO
goes	OO
only	OO
where	OO
he	OO
wants	.O
to	OU
a	OO
direction	OO
he	OO
doesn't	OO
to	OO
want	OO
to	OO
go	,O
he	OO
does	OO
like	OO
this	.O
can	OU
you	OO
see	OO
he	OO
is	OO
hanging	OO
on	OO
with	OO
all	OO
his	OO
might	?O
planting	OU
his	OO
feet	OO
firmly	OO
on	OO
the	OO
ground	,O
digging	OO
his	OO
nails	OO
into	OO
it	,O
he	OO
never	OO
goes	OO
where	OO
he	OO
doesn't	OO
want	OO
to	.O
while	OU
walking	OO
on	OO
the	OO
street	,O
i	OU
sometimes	OO
struggle	OO
with	OO
bailey	OU
sitting	OO
there	.O
people	OU
passing	OO
by	OO
always	OO
say	OO
laughing	,O
'that's	OO
troublesome'	.O
but	OU
he	OO
has	OO
never	OO
refused	OO
to	OO
go	OO
to	OO
the	OO
hospital	.O
on	OU
the	OO
contrary	,O
he	OO
sometimes	OO
refuses	OO
to	OO
go	OO
home	,O
squatting	OO
there	,O
going	OO
back	OO
into	OO
the	OO
hospital	OO
ward	.O
dogs	OU
easily	OO
understand	OO
what	OO
people	OO
are	OO
thinking	OO
about	OO
them	.O
because	OU
there	OO
are	OO
many	OO
people	OO
who	OO
love	OO
him	,O
bailey	OU
loves	OO
the	OO
hospital	OO
very	OO
much	.O
both	OU
a	OO
dog	OO
and	OO
people	OO
are	OO
mutually	OO
affected;	OO
that	OO
is	OO
where	OO
the	OO
facility	OO
dog	OO
belongs	.O
this	OU
is	OO
why	OO
non	OO
sentient	OO
toy	OO
dogs	OO
cannot	OO
make	OO
this	OO
happen	.O
a	OU
robot	OO
dog	OO
can	OO
not	OO
make	OO
this	OO

the	OU
third	OO
bond	OO
is	OO
between	OO
bailey	OU
and	OO
the	OO
medical	OO
staff	.O
the	OU
handler	OO
of	OO
a	OO
facility	OO
dog	OO

a	OO

why	OO
only	OO

staff	OO
can	OO
be	OO
a	OO
handler	OO
of	OO
a	OO
facility	OO
dog	OO
is:	OO

in	OO
the	OO

what	OO

and	OO
why	OO
a	OO

of	OO
a	OO

must	OO
be	OO
certified	OO
medical	OO
staff	.O
it	OU

five	OO
years	OO
since	OO

and	OO
i	OU
started	OO
working	OO
in	OO
japan	.U
we	OU
have	OO
met	OO
thousands	OO
of	OO

once	OO
met	OO
a	OO

in	OO
the	OO

the	OO
kid	OO
could	OO
not	OO

he	OU

that	OO

his	OO
situation	.O
given	OU
a	OO
short	OO

of	OO

both	OO
his	OO

then	OU

though	OO
it	OO

a	OO

he	OU

ice	OO

level	OO

the	OU

also	OO
having	OO

there	OU

that's	OU
on	OO

now	,U
a	OO

out	OO

it's	OO
a	OO

if	OO

that	OO

it	?O
and	OU
what	OO
can	OO
you	OO
do	OO
to	OO

it	?O
well	,U
there	OO
are	OO
two	OO
things	,O
scientifically	OO
shown	,O
that	OO
prevent	OO
or	OO
reduce	OO
the	OO
risk	OO
of	OO
sudep	.U
the	OU
first	OO
is:	OO
follow	OU
your	OO
doctor's	OO
instructions	,O
take	OO
your	OO
medications	.O
two	OU
thirds	OO
of	OO
people	OO
who	OO
have	OO
epilepsy	OO
get	OO
it	OO
under	OO
control	OO
with	OO
their	OO
medications	.O
the	OU
second	OO
thing	OO
that	OO
reduces	OO
the	OO
risk	OO
of	OO
sudep	OU
is	OO
companionship	.O
it's	OU
having	OO
somebody	OO
there	OO
at	OO
the	OO
time	OO
that	OO
you	OO
have	OO
a	OO
seizure	.O
now	,U
sudep	,U
even	OO
though	OO
most	OO
of	OO
you	OO
have	OO
never	OO
heard	OO
of	OO
it	,O
is	OO
actually	OO
the	OO
number	OO
two	OO
cause	OO
of	OO
years	OO
of	OO
potential	OO
life	OO
lost	OO
of	OO
all	OO
neurological	OO
disorders	.O
the	OU
vertical	OO
axis	OO
is	OO
the	OO
number	OO
of	OO
deaths	OO
times	OO
the	OO
remaining	OO
life	OO
span	,O
so	OO
higher	OO
is	OO
much	OO
worse	OO
impact	.O
sudep	,U
however	,O
unlike	OO
these	OO
others	,O
is	OO
something	OO
that	OO
people	OO
right	OO
here	OO
could	OO
do	OO
something	OO
to	OO
push	OO
that	OO
down	.O
now	,U
what	OO
is	OO
roz	OU
picard	,U
an	OO
ai	OU
researcher	,O
doing	OO
here	OO
telling	OO
you	OO
about	OO
sudep	,U
right	?O
i'm	OU
not	OO
a	OO
neurologist	.O
when	OU
i	OU
was	OO
working	OO
at	OO
the	OO
media	OU
lab	OU
on	OO
measurement	OO
of	OO
emotion	,O
trying	OO
to	OO
make	OO
our	OO
machines	OO
more	OO
intelligent	OO
about	OO
our	OO
emotions	,O
we	OO
started	OO
doing	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
work	OO
measuring	OO
stress	.O
we	OU
built	OO
lots	OO
of	OO
sensors	OO
that	OO
measured	OO
it	OO
in	OO
lots	OO
of	OO
different	OO
ways	.O
but	OU
one	OO
of	OO
them	OO
in	OO
particular	OO
grew	OO
out	OO
of	OO
some	OO
of	OO
this	OO
very	OO
old	OO
work	OO
with	OO
measuring	OO
sweaty	OO
palms	OO
with	OO
an	OO
electrical	OO
signal	.O
this	OU
is	OO
a	OO
signal	OO
of	OO
skin	OO
conductance	OO
that's	OO
known	OO
to	OO
go	OO
up	OO
when	OO
you	OO
get	OO
nervous	,O
but	OO
it	OO
turns	OO
out	OO
it	OO
also	OO
goes	OO
up	OO
with	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
other	OO
interesting	OO
conditions	.O
but	OU
measuring	OO
it	OO
with	OO
wires	OO
on	OO
your	OO
hand	OO
is	OO
really	OO
inconvenient	.O
so	OU
we	OO
invented	OO
a	OO
bunch	OO
of	OO
other	OO
ways	OO
of	OO
doing	OO
this	OO
at	OO
the	OO
mit	OU
media	OU
lab	.U
and	OU
with	OO
these	OO
wearables	,O
we	OO
started	OO
to	OO
collect	OO
the	OO
first	OO
ever	OO
clinical	OO
quality	OO
data	OO
24	OO
7	.O
here's	OU
a	OO
picture	OO
of	OO
what	OO
that	OO
looked	OO
like	OO
the	OO
first	OO
time	OO
an	OO
mit	OU
student	OO
collected	OO
skin	OO
conductance	OO
on	OO
the	OO

24	OO
7	.O
let's	OU
zoom	OO
in	OO
a	OO
little	OO
bit	OO
here	.O
what	OU
you	OO
see	OO
is	OO
24	OO
hours	OO
from	OO
left	OO
to	OO
right	,O
and	OO
here	OO
is	OO
two	OO
days	OO
of	OO
data	.O
and	OU
first	,O
what	OO
surprised	OO
us	OO
was	OO
sleep	OO
was	OO
the	OO
biggest	OO
peak	OO
of	OO
the	OO
day	.O
now	,U
that	OO
sounds	OO
broken	,O
right	?O
you're	OU
calm	OO
when	OO
you're	OO
asleep	,O
so	OO
what's	OO
going	OO
on	OO
here	?O
well	,U
it	OO
turns	OO
out	OO
that	OO
our	OO
physiology	OO
during	OO
sleep	OO
is	OO
very	OO
different	OO
than	OO
our	OO
physiology	OO
during	OO
wake	,O
and	OO
while	OO
there's	OO
still	OO
a	OO
bit	OO
of	OO
a	OO
mystery	OO
why	OO
these	OO
peaks	OO
are	OO
usually	OO
the	OO
biggest	OO
of	OO
the	OO
day	OO
during	OO
sleep	,O
we	OO
now	OO
believe	OO
they're	OO
related	OO
to	OO
memory	OO
consolidation	OO
and	OO
memory	OO
formation	OO
during	OO
sleep	.O
we	OU
also	OO
saw	OO
things	OO
that	OO
were	OO
exactly	OO
what	OO
we	OO
expected	.O
when	OU
an	OO
mit	OU
student	OO
is	OO
working	OO
hard	OO
in	OO
the	OO
lab	OO
or	OO
on	OO
homeworks	,O
there	OO
is	OO
not	OO
only	OO
emotional	OO
stress	,O
but	OO
there's	OO
cognitive	OO
load	,O
and	OO
it	OO
turns	OO
out	OO
that	OO
cognitive	OO
load	,O
cognitive	OO
effort	,O
mental	OO
engagement	,O
excitement	OO
about	OO
learning	OO
something	OO
—	OO
those	OO
things	OO
also	OO
make	OO
the	OO
signal	OO
go	OO
up	.O
unfortunately	,U
to	OO
the	OO
embarrassment	OO
of	OO
we	OO
mit	OU
professors	,O
the	OO
low	OO
point	OO
every	OO
day	OO
is	OO
classroom	OO
activity	.O
now	,U
i	OU
am	OO
just	OO
showing	OO
you	OO
one	OO
person's	OO
data	OO
here	,O
but	OO
this	,O
unfortunately	,O
is	OO
true	OO
in	OO
general	.O
this	OU
sweatband	OO
has	OO
inside	OO
it	OO
a	OO
homebuilt	OO
skin	OO
conductance	OO
sensor	,O
and	OO
one	OO
day	,O
one	OO
of	OO
our	OO
undergrads	OO
knocked	OO
on	OO
my	OO
door	OO
right	OO
at	OO
the	OO
end	OO
of	OO
the	OO
december	OU
semester	,O
and	OO
he	OO
said	,O
professor	OU
picard	,U
can	OO
i	OU
please	OO
borrow	OO
one	OO
of	OO
your	OO
wristband	OO
sensors	?O
my	OU
little	OO
brother	OO
has	OO
autism	,O
he	OO
can't	OO
talk	,O
and	OO
i	OU
want	OO
to	OO
see	OO
what's	OO
stressing	OO
him	OO
out	.O
and	OU
i	OU
said	,O
sure	,U
in	OO
fact	,O
don't	OO
just	OO
take	OO
one	,O
take	OO
two	,O
because	OO
they	OO
broke	OO
easily	OO
back	OO
then	.O
so	OU
he	OO
took	OO
them	OO
home	,O
he	OO
put	OO
them	OO
on	OO
his	OO
little	OO
brother	.O
now	,U
i	OU
was	OO
back	OO
in	OO
mit	,U
looking	OO
at	OO
the	OO
data	OO
on	OO
my	OO
laptop	,O
and	OO
the	OO
first	OO
day	,O
i	OU
thought	,O
hmm	,U
that's	OO
odd	,O
he	OO
put	OO
them	OO
on	OO
both	OO
wrists	OO
instead	OO
of	OO
waiting	OO
for	OO
one	OO
to	OO
break	.O
ok	,U
fine	,O
don't	OO
follow	OO
my	OO
instructions	.O
i'm	OU
glad	OO
he	OO
didn't	.O
second	OU
day	OO
—	OO
chill	.O
looked	OU
like	OO
classroom	OO
activity	.O
a	OU
few	OO
more	OO
days	OO
ahead	.O
the	OU
next	OO
day	,O
one	OO
wrist	OO
signal	OO
was	OO
flat	OO
and	OO
the	OO
other	OO
had	OO
the	OO
biggest	OO
peak	OO
i've	OU
ever	OO
seen	,O
and	OO
i	OU
thought	,O
what's	OU
going	OO
on	?O
we've	OU
stressed	OO
people	OO
out	OO
at	OO
mit	OU
every	OO
way	OO
imaginable	.O
i've	OU
never	OO
seen	OO
a	OO
peak	OO
this	OO
big	.O
and	OU
it	OO
was	OO
only	OO
on	OO
one	OO
side	.O
how	OU
can	OO
you	OO
be	OO
stressed	OO
on	OO
one	OO
side	OO
of	OO
your	OO
body	OO
and	OO
not	OO
the	OO
other	?O
so	OU
i	OU
thought	OO
one	OO
or	OO
both	OO
sensors	OO
must	OO
be	OO
broken	.O
now	,U
i'm	OU
an	OO
electroengineer	OO
by	OO
training	,O
so	OO
i	OU
started	OO
a	OO
whole	OO
bunch	OO
of	OO
stuff	OO
to	OO
try	OO
to	OO
debug	OO
this	,O
and	OO
long	OO
story	OO
short	,O
i	OU
could	OO
not	OO
reproduce	OO
this	.O
so	OU
i	OU
resorted	OO
to	OO
old	OO
fashioned	OO
debugging	.O
i	OU
called	OO
the	OO
student	OO
at	OO
home	OO
on	OO
vacation	.O
hi	,U
how's	OO
your	OO
little	OO
brother	?O
how's	OU
your	OO
christmas	?U
hey	,U
do	OO
you	OO
have	OO
any	OO
idea	OO
what	OO
happened	OO
to	OO
him	?O
and	OU
i	OU
gave	OO
this	OO
particular	OO
date	OO
and	OO
time	,O
and	OO
the	OO
data	.O
and	OU
he	OO
said	,O
i	OU
don't	OO

i'll	OU
check	OO
the	OO
diary	.O
diary	?U
an	OU
mit	OU
student	OO
keeps	OO
a	OO
diary	?O
so	OU
i	OU
waited	OO
and	OO
he	OO
came	OO
back	.O
he	OU
had	OO
the	OO
exact	OO
date	OO
and	OO
time	,O
and	OO
he	OO
says	,O
that	OU
was	OO
right	OO
before	OO
he	OO
had	OO
a	OO
grand	OO
mal	OO
seizure	.O
now	,U
at	OO
the	OO
time	,O
i	OU
didn't	OO
know	OO
anything	OO
about	OO
epilepsy	,O
and	OO
did	OO
a	OO
bunch	OO
of	OO
research	,O
realized	OO
that	OO
another	OO
student's	OO
dad	OO
is	OO
chief	OO
of	OO
neurosurgery	OO
at	OO
children's	OU
hospital	OU
boston	,U
screwed	OO
up	OO

hi	,U

madsen	,U
my	OO

is	OU
it	OO
possible	OO
somebody	OO
could	OO

a	OO
huge	OO
sympathetic	OO

—	OO
that's	OO
what	OO
drives	OO
the	OO
skin	OO

—	OO
20	OO
minutes	OO
before	OO
a	OO

and	OU
he	OO
says	,O
probably	OU
not	.O
he	OU
says	,O
it's	OU
interesting	.O
we've	OU
had	OO
people	OO
whose	OO
hair	OO

on	OO
one	OO

20	OO
minutes	OO
before	OO
a	OO

and	OU
i'm	OU
like	,O
on	OU
one	OO
arm	?O
i	OU
didn't	OO
want	OO
to	OO
tell	OO
him	OO
that	,O
initially	,O
because	OO
i	OU
thought	OO
this	OO
was	OO
too	OO
ridiculous	.O
he	OU
explained	OO
how	OO
this	OO
could	OO
happen	OO
in	OO
the	OO

and	OO
he	OO
got	OO
interested	.O
i	OU
showed	OO
him	OO
the	OO

we	OU
made	OO
a	OO
whole	OO

more	OO
devices	,O

them	OO

90	OO

and	OO
now	OO
eda	,U
electrodermal	OO

to	OO
see	OO
if	OO
there	OO
was	OO
something	OO
in	OO
this	OO

that	OO
we	OO
could	OO
easily	OO
pick	OO
up	,O
related	OO
to	OO
a	OO

we	OU
found	,O
in	OO
100	OO
percent	OO
of	OO
the	OO
first	OO
batch	OO
of	OO
grand	OO
mal	OO
seizures	,O
this	OO
whopper	OO
of	OO

in	OO
the	OO

the	OU
blue	OO
in	OO
the	OO

the	OO

the	OO

of	OO
the	OO

these	OU
three	OO

you	OO
see	OO
here	OO
are	OO
popping	OO
out	OO
of	OO
the	OO
forest	OO
like	OO
redwood	OO

furthermore	,U
when	OO
you	OO
couple	OO
the	OO
skin	OO

at	OO
the	OO

with	OO
the	OO
movement	OO
from	OO
the	OO

and	OO
you	OO

ai	OU
on	OO
it	,O
you	OO

these	OO
patterns	OO
much	OO
better	OO
than	OO
just	OO
a	OO

do	.O
so	OU
we	OO
realized	OO
that	OO
we	OO
needed	OO
to	OO
get	OO
this	OO
out	,O

with	OO
the	OO

this	OO
has	OO
made	OO
progress	OO
and	OO
the	OO
seizure	OO
detection	OO
is	OO
much	OO
more	OO
accurate	.O
but	OU
we	OO
also	OO
learned	OO
some	OO
other	OO
things	OO
about	OO
sudep	OU
during	OO
this	.O
one	OU
thing	OO
we	OO
learned	OO
is	OO
that	OO
sudep	,U
while	OO
it's	OO
rare	OO
after	OO
a	OO
generalized	OO
tonic	OO
clonic	OO
seizure	,O
that's	OO
when	OO
it's	OO
most	OO
likely	OO
to	OO
happen	OO
—	OO
after	OO
that	OO
type	.O
and	OU
when	OO
it	OO
happens	,O
it	OO
doesn't	OO
happen	OO
during	OO
the	OO
seizure	,O
and	OO
it	OO
doesn't	OO
usually	OO
happen	OO
immediately	OO
afterwards	,O
but	OO
immediately	OO
afterwards	,O
when	OO
the	OO
person	OO
just	OO
seems	OO
very	OO

they	OO
may	OO
go	OO

and	OO
then	OO
after	OO
the	OO

later	OO
the	OO

so	OU
there's	OO
some	OO
time	OO
to	OO
get	OO
somebody	OO
there	.O
we	OU
also	OO
learned	OO
that	OO
there	OO
is	OO
a	OO
region	OO
deep	OO
in	OO
the	OO

called	OO
the	OO
amygdala	,O
which	OO
we	OO
had	OO

studying	OO
in	OO
our	OO
emotion	OO
research	OO
a	OO
lot	.O
we	OU
have	OO
two	OO
amygdalas	,O
and	OO
if	OO
you	OO
stimulate	OO
the	OO
right	OO
one	,O
you	OO
get	OO
a	OO
big	OO
right	OO
skin	OO
conductance	OO

now	,U
you	OO
have	OO
to	OO
sign	OO
up	OO
right	OO
now	OO
for	OO
a	OO
craniotomy	OO
to	OO
get	OO
this	OO
done	,O
not	OO
exactly	OO
something	OO
we're	OO
going	OO
to	OO
volunteer	OO
to	OO
do	,O
but	OO
it	OO
causes	OO
a	OO
big	OO

stimulate	OU
the	OO
left	OO
one	,O
big	OO
left	OO
skin	OO

on	OO
the	OO

and	OU
furthermore	,O
when	OO
somebody	OO

your	OO
amygdala	OO
while	OO
you're	OO
sitting	OO
there	OO
and	OO
you	OO
might	OO
just	OO
be	OO
working	,O
you	OO
don't	OO
show	OO
any	OO
signs	OO
of	OO
distress	,O
but	OO
you	OO
stop	OO
breathing	,O
and	OO
you	OO
don't	OO
start	OO
again	OO
until	OO
somebody	OO
stimulates	OO
you	.O
hey	,U
roz	,U
are	OO
you	OO
there	?O
and	OU
you	OO
open	OO
your	OO

as	OU
you	OO
take	OO
that	OO

to	OO

you	OO

so	OU
we	OO

the	OO

it's	OO

somebody	OO
you	OO

the	OO

this	OO

because	OO
one	OO
in	OO

of	OO
you	OO

have	OO
epilepsy	OO
at	OO

it	.O
so	OU

ai	OU
or	OO
whatever	OO
to	OO

you	OO

why	OU

all	OO
this	OO
hard	OO
work	OO
to	OO
build	OO
ais	?U
a	OU

reasons	OO
here:	OO
one	OO

natasha	,U
the	OO
girl	OO
who	OO

her	OO

they've	OO

and	OU
the	OO
other	OO
reason	OO

all	OO
of	OO
you	,O
because	OO
we	OO

the	OO
opportunity	OO
to	OO

the	OO

we	OU

that	OO

you	.O
the	OU

a	OO
hurricane	OO
or	OO
a	OO
tropical	OO
storm	OO
showing	OO
high	OO
winds	OO
battering	OO
trees	OO

houses	,O
ask	OO
yourself	,O
how	OU
did	OO
the	OO
wind	OO
get	OO
going	OO
so	OO
fast	?O
amazingly	OU
enough	,O
this	OO
is	OO
a	OO
motion	OO
that	OO
started	OO
more	OO
than	OO
five	OO
billion	OO
years	OO
ago	.O
but	,U
to	OO
understand	OO
why	,O
we	OO
need	OO
to	OO
understand	OO
spin	.O
in	OU
physics	,O
we	OO
talk	OO
about	OO
two	OO
types	OO
of	OO
motion	.O
the	OU
first	OO
is	OO
straight	OO
line	OO
motion	.O
you	OU
push	OO
on	OO
something	,O
and	OO
it	OO
moves	OO
forward	.O
the	OU
second	OO
type	,O
spin	,O
involves	OO
an	OO
object	OO
rotating	,O
or	OO
turning	OO
on	OO
its	OO
axis	OO
in	OO
place	.O
an	OU
object	OO
in	OO
straight	OO
line	OO
motion	OO
will	OO
move	OO
forever	OO
unless	OO
something	,O
like	OO
the	OO
friction	OO
of	OO
the	OO
ground	OO
beneath	OO
it	,O
causes	OO
it	OO
to	OO
slow	OO
down	OO
and	OO
stop	.O
the	OU
same	OO
thing	OO
happens	OO
when	OO
you	OO
get	OO
something	OO
spinning	.O
it	OU
will	OO
keep	OO
on	OO
spinning	OO
until	OO
something	OO
stops	OO
it	.O
but	OU
the	OO
spin	OO
can	OO
speed	OO
up	.O
if	OU
an	OO
ice	OO
skater	OO
is	OO
gliding	OO
across	OO
the	OO
ice	OO
in	OO
straight	OO
line	OO
motion	OO
and	OO
she	OO
pulls	OO
her	OO
arms	OO
in	,O
she	OO
keeps	OO
on	OO
gliding	OO
at	OO
the	OO
same	OO
speed	.O
but	OU
if	OO
she	OO
is	OO
spinning	OO
on	OO
the	OO
ice	OO
and	OO
she	OO
pulls	OO
her	OO
arms	OO
in	,O
you	OO
know	OO
what	OO
happens	OO
next	.O
she	OU
spins	OO
faster	.O
this	OU
is	OO
called	OO
the	OO
conservation	OO
of	OO
angular	OO
momentum	.O
mathematically	,U
angular	OO
momentum	OO
is	OO
a	OO
product	OO
of	OO
two	OO
numbers	,O
one	OO
that	OO
gives	OO
the	OO
spin	OO
rate	OO
and	OO
one	OO
that	OO
gives	OO
the	OO
distance	OO
of	OO
the	OO
mass	OO
from	OO
the	OO
axis	.O
if	OU
something	OO
is	OO
freely	OO
spinning	,O
as	OO
one	OO
number	OO
gets	OO
bigger	,O
the	OO
other	OO
gets	OO
smaller	.O
arms	OU
closer	,O
spin	OO
faster	.O
arms	OU
farther	,O
spin	OO
slower	.O
spin	OU
causes	OO
other	OO
effects	,O
too	.O
if	OU
you	OO

you	OO

right	OO
now	OO
at	OO

the	OO

the	OU
earth	OU

once	OO
each	OO

but	OU
why	OO
does	OO
the	OO
earth	OU
spin	?O
now	,U
that's	OO
a	OO
story	OO
that	OO

a	OU

before	OU

this	OO

a	OO

that	OO

the	OO

and	OO
faster	.O
and	OU
everything	OO
that	OO

out	OO
of	OO
the	OO

the	OO

the	OO

all	OO
inherited	OO
this	OO
spin	.O
and	OU
this	OO
inherited	OO
spin	OO
is	OO
what	OO
gives	OO
us	OO
night	OO
and	OO

and	OU
this	OO
day	OO
night	OO
cycle	OO
is	OO
what	OO
drives	OO
our	OO

the	OU
earth	OU
is	OO
warm	OO
on	OO
the	OO
daytime	OO
side	,O
cool	OO
on	OO
the	OO
nighttime	OO
side	,O
and	OO
it's	OO
warmer	OO
at	OO
the	OO
equator	OO
than	OO
at	OO
the	OO

the	OU
differences	OO
in	OO

and	OO
the	OO
differences	OO
in	OO

they	OU
make	OO
the	OO

but	,U
because	OO
the	OO
earth	OU
spins	,O
the	OO
moving	OO
air	OO
curves	OO
to	OO
the	OO
right	OO
in	OO
the	OO

because	OO
of	OO

if	OU
there's	OO
a	OO
region	OO
of	OO

pressure	OO
in	OO
the	OO
atmosphere	,O
air	OO
is	OO
pushed	OO
toward	OO
it	,O

but	OU
the	OO
air	OO
curves	OO
to	OO
the	OO
right	OO
as	OO
it	OO
goes	,O

this	OO
gives	OO
it	OO
a	OO
spin	.O
with	OU
the	OO
dramatic	OO
low	OO
pressure	OO
in	OO
a	OO
storm	,O
the	OO
air	OO
gets	OO
pulled	OO
in	OO
tighter	OO

tighter	,O

and	OO
this	OO
is	OO
how	OO
we	OO
get	OO
the	OO

so	,U
when	OO

think	OO
about	OO
this:	OO

let's	OU
imagine	OO
there	OO
are	OO
two	OO
ships:	OO
the	OO
ship	OO
that	OO
theseus	OU
docked	OO
in	OO
athens	,U
ship	OU
a	,U
and	OO
the	OO
ship	OO
sailed	OO
by	OO
the	OO
athenians	OU
1000	OO
years	OO
later	,O
ship	OU
b	.U
very	OU
simply	,O
our	OO
question	OO
is	OO
this:	OO
does	OO
a	OU
equal	OO
b	?U
some	OU
would	OO
say	OO
that	OO
for	OO
1000	OO
years	OO
there	OO
has	OO
been	OO
only	OO
one	OO
ship	OU
of	OO
theseus	,U
and	OO
because	OO
the	OO
changes	OO
made	OO
to	OO
it	OO
happened	OO
gradually	,O
it	OO
never	OO
at	OO
any	OO
point	OO
in	OO
time	OO
stopped	OO
being	OO
the	OO
legendary	OO
ship	.O
though	OU
they	OO
have	OO
absolutely	OO
no	OO
parts	OO
in	OO
common	,O
the	OO
two	OO
ships	OO
are	OO
numerically	OO
identical	,O
meaning	OO
one	OO
and	OO
the	OO
same	,O
so	OO
a	OU
equals	OO
b	.U
however	,U
others	OO
could	OO
argue	OO
that	OO
theseus	OU
never	OO
set	OO
foot	OO
on	OO
ship	OU
b	,U
and	OO
his	OO
presence	OO
on	OO
the	OO
ship	OO
is	OO
an	OO
essential	OO
qualitative	OO
property	OO
of	OO
the	OO
ship	OU
of	OO
theseus	.U
it	OU
cannot	OO
survive	OO
without	OO
him	.O
so	,U
though	OO
the	OO
two	OO
ships	OO
are	OO
numerically	OO
identical	,O
they	OO
are	OO
not	OO
qualitatively	OO
identical	.O
thus	,U
a	OU
does	OO
not	OO
equal	OO
b	.U
but	OU
what	OO
happens	OO
when	OO
we	OO
consider	OO
this	OO
twist	?O
what	OU
if	,O
as	OO
each	OO
piece	OO
of	OO
the	OO
original	OO
ship	OO
was	OO
cast	OO
off	,O
somebody	OO
collected	OO
them	OO
all	,O
and	OO
rebuilt	OO
the	OO
entire	OO
original	OO
ship	?O
when	OU
it	OO
was	OO
finished	,O
undeniably	OO
two	OO
physical	OO
ships	OO
would	OO
exist:	OO
the	OO
one	OO
that's	OO
docked	OO
in	OO
athens	,U
and	OO
the	OO
one	OO
in	OO
some	OO
guy's	OO
backyard	.O
each	OU
could	OO
lay	OO
claim	OO
to	OO
the	OO
title	,O
the	OU
ship	OU
of	OO
theseus	,U
but	OO
only	OO
would	OO
could	OO
actually	OO
be	OO
the	OO
real	OO
thing	.O
so	OU
which	OO
one	OO
is	OO
it	,O
and	OO
more	OO
importantly	,O
what	OO
does	OO
this	OO
have	OO
to	OO
do	OO
with	OO
you	?O
like	OU
the	OO
ship	OU
of	OO
theseus	,U
you	OO

in	OO
an	OO
amazing	OO
and	OO
sometimes	OO

way	,O
you	OO

the	OO

this	OU

one	OO
of	OO
the	OO

a	OO

all	OU

back	OU
in	OO

the	OO

the	OO

another	OU
physicist's	OO
work	OO
sparked	OO
marie	OU
curie's	OU
interest	.O
in	OU
1896	,O
henri	OU

discovered	OO
that	OO

that	OO

curie	OU
soon	OO
found	OO
that	OO
the	OO
element	OO
thorium	OO
emitted	OO
similar	OO
radiation	.O
most	OU
importantly	,O
the	OO
strength	OO
of	OO
the	OO
radiation	OO
depended	OO
solely	OO
on	OO
the	OO
element's	OO
quantity	,O
and	OO
was	OO
not	OO
affected	OO
by	OO
physical	OO
or	OO
chemical	OO
changes	.O
this	OU
led	OO
her	OO
to	OO
conclude	OO
that	OO
radiation	OO
was	OO
coming	OO
from	OO
something	OO
fundamental	OO
within	OO
the	OO
atoms	OO
of	OO
each	OO
element	.O
the	OU
idea	OO
was	OO
radical	OO
and	OO
helped	OO
to	OO
disprove	OO
the	OO
long	OO
standing	OO
model	OO
of	OO
atoms	OO
as	OO
indivisible	OO
objects	.O
next	,U
by	OO
focusing	OO
on	OO
a	OO
super	OO
radioactive	OO
ore	OO
called	OO
pitchblende	,O
the	OO
curies	OU
realized	OO
that	OO
uranium	OO
alone	OO

be	OO
creating	OO
all	OO
the	OO
radiation	.O
so	,U
were	OO
there	OO
other	OO
radioactive	OO
elements	OO
that	OO
might	OO
be	OO
responsible	?O
in	OU
1898	,O
they	OO
reported	OO
two	OO

elements	,O
polonium	,O

and	OO
radium	,O
the	OO
latin	OU

for	OO

they	OU
also	OO
coined	OO
the	OO

radioactivity	OO
along	OO
the	OO
way	.O
by	OU
1902	,O
the	OO

a	OO

of	OO
pure	OO
radium	OO

from	OO
several	OO

how	OO

let's	OU
take	OO
a	OO
page	OO
from	OO
isaac	OU
newton	.U
he	OU
had	OO
this	OO
idea	,O
a	OO
little	OO
mental	OO
experiment:	OO
you	OU
take	OO
a	OO
cannon	,O
you	OO
put	OO
it	OO
on	OO

a	OO

if	OU
you	OO
shoot	OO
the	OO
cannonball	,O
it	OO
goes	OO
a	OO
little	OO
bit	OO
away	.O
but	OU
if	OO
you	OO
shoot	OO
it	OO
harder	,O
it	OO
goes	OO
far	OO
enough	OO
so	OO
that	OO
it	OO
lands	OO
a	OO
little	OO
bit	OO
past	OO
the	OO
curvature	OO
of	OO
earth	.U
well	,U
you	OO
can	OO
imagine	OO
if	OO
you	OO
shot	OO
it	OO
really	,O
really	,O
hard	,O
it	OO
would	OO
go	OO
all	OO
the	OO
way	OO
around	OO
the	OO
earth	OU
and	OO
come	OO
back	OO
—	OO
boom	.O
—	OO
and	OO
hit	OO
you	OO
in	OO
the	OO
backside	OO
or	OO
something	.O
let's	OU
zoom	OO
way	OO
back	OO
and	OO
put	OO
you	OO
in	OO
a	OO
little	OO
satellite	OO
over	OO
the	OO
north	OU
pole	OU
of	OO
the	OO
earth	OU
and	OO
consider	OO
north	OO
to	OO
be	OO
up	.O
you're	OU
going	OO
to	OO
fall	OO
down	OO
and	OO
hit	OO
the	OO
earth	.U
but	OU
you	OO
are	OO
actually	OO
moving	OO
sideways	OO
really	OO
fast	.O
so	OU
when	OO
you	OO

down	,O
you're	OO

you're	OU

now	OO
the	OO

you	OO

it's	OO
pulling	OO
you	OO

you	OO
fall	OO

you	OO

the	OU

the	OO
earth's	OU
pulling	OO
you	OO
sideways	.O
so	OU
you're	OO
going	OO
to	OO
fall	OO
sideways	,O
but	OO
you're	OO
going	OO
to	OO
be	OO
moving	OO
up	OO
and	OO
so	OO
you'll	OO

now	OU
you're	OO
back	OO
on	OO

the	OO
earth	OU
again	,O
over	OO
the	OO
north	OU

going	OO
sideways	OO
and	OO
falling	OO
down	,O
and	OO
yep	OO
—	OO
you	OO
guessed	OO
it	.O
you'll	OU
keep	OO
missing	OO
because	OO
you're	OO
moving	OO
so	OO
fast	.O
in	OU
this	OO
way	,O
astronauts	OO
orbit	OO
the	OO
earth	.U
they're	OU
always	OO
falling	OO
towards	OO
the	OO

but	OO
they're	OO

and	OO
therefore	,O
they're	OO
falling	OO
all	OO
the	OO

they	OU
feel	OO
like	OO
they're	OO
falling	,O
so	OO
you	OO
just	OO
have	OO
to	OO
get	OO
over	OO
it	.O
so	OU
technically	,O
if	OO
you	OO
ran	OO
fast	OO
enough	OO
and	OO

you	OO
could	OO
miss	OO
the	OO
earth	.U
but	OU
there's	OO
a	OO
big	OO
problem	.O
first	,U
you	OO
have	OO
to	OO
be	OO
going	OO
eight	OO
kilometers	OO
a	OO
second	.O
that's	OU
18,000	OO
miles	OO
an	OO
hour	,O
just	OO
over	OO
mach	OU
23	.O
the	OU
second	OO
problem:	OO
if	OU
you're	OO
going	OO
that	OO
fast	,O
yes	,O
you	OO
would	OO
orbit	OO
the	OO
earth	OU
and	OO
come	OO
back	OO
where	OO
you	OO
came	OO
from	,O
but	OO
there's	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
air	OO
in	OO
the	OO
way	,O
much	OO
less	OO
people	OO
and	OO
things	.O
so	OU
you	OO
would	OO
burn	OO
up	OO
due	OO
to	OO

so	,U
i	OU
do	OO
not	OO

this	.O

the	OO

you	OO

after	OO

that's	OO

the	OU

that's	OO

the	OU

that	OO

we	OO

our	OO

inside	OU
each	OO

does	OO
it	OO
take	OO
a	OO

it	OO
takes	OO

them	OO
where	OO
they	OO

the	OU
universal	OO

that	OO

the	OO

that's	OO

to	OO

a	OO

that	OO

the	OU

you	OU

to	OO

you'll	OO
hardly	OO

the	OO

your	OU

be	OO
indistinguishable	OO
from	OO

life's	OU
natural	OO

just	OO

right	?O
it	OU
may	OO

perhaps	OO
it's	OO
not	OO

as	OO
it	OO

the	OU

was	OO
actually	OO
designed	OO
to	OO
refute	OO
a	OO
philosophical	OO
notion	OO
called	OO
hedonism	.O
according	OU
to	OO
hedonists	,O
maximizing	OO
net	OO
pleasure	OO
is	OO
the	OO
most	OO
important	OO
thing	OO
in	OO

because	OO

the	OO

that	OO

for	OU
hedonists	,O
the	OO
best	OO

that	OO
a	OO

let's	OO

with	OO

as	OU
its	OO

two	OO
aspects:	OO
the	OO

the	OO
behavioral	OO

in	OO
to	OO
relieve	OO
the	OO

the	OO
obsessions	OO

the	OU
kinds	OO
of	OO
actions	OO
that	OO

often	OO
associate	OO
with	OO
ocd	,U
like	OO
excessive	OO
hand	OO

things	OO
repeatedly	,O
may	OO
be	OO
examples	OO
of	OO

or	OO
compulsive	OO
tendencies	OO
that	OO
many	OO
of	OO
us	OO
exhibit	OO
from	OO
time	OO
to	OO
time	.O
but	OU
the	OO
actual	OO
disorder	OO
is	OO
far	OO
more	OO
rare	OO
and	OO
can	OO
be	OO
quite	OO
debilitating	.O
people	OU
affected	OO
have	OO
little	OO
or	OO
no	OO
control	OO
over	OO
their	OO
obsessive	OO
thoughts	OO

to	OO
the	OO
point	OO
of	OO

this	OU

the	OO

of	OO

the	OO
most	OO
common	OO
image	OO
of	OO
ocd	OU
in	OO
popular	OO
culture	,O
obsessions	OO

take	OO
many	OO

what	OO

ocd	OU

considered	OO
a	OO

that	OO

actually	OO
hardwired	OO
to	OO

the	OU
other	OO
piece	OO
of	OO
the	OO
puzzle	OO
is	OO
that	OO
ocd	OU
is	OO
associated	OO
with	OO
low	OO
levels	OO
of	OO
serotonin	,O
a	OO
neurotransmitter	OO
that	OO
communicates	OO

around	OO
the	OO

everyone	OU
said	OO
it	OO
was	OO
crazy	OO
because	OO
they	OO
still	OO
thought	OO
the	OO
world	OO
was	OO
flat	,O
but	OO
he	OO

when	OO

he	OO

something	OO
better	OO

first	OU
of	OO
all	,O

the	OO

anything	.O
there	OU
were	OO
already	OO
people	OO

here	OO
for	OO

and	OU
he	OO

the	OO
first	OO

the	OU
norse	OU
had	OO
settled	OO
newfoundland	OU
almost	OO
500	OO

you	OU
don't	OO

so	OO
how	OO
come	OO
we're	OO
not	OO
all	OO
wearing	OO
those	OO
cow	OO

actually	,U
they	OO
didn't	OO

those	OO
either	.O
cough	OU
who	OU
cares	OO
what	OO
some	OO
vikings	OU
did	OO
way	OO
back	OO
when	?O
those	OU
settlements	OO
didn't	OO
last	,O
but	OO
columbus's	OU
did	.O
and	OU
the	OO
news	OO
he	OO
brought	OO
back	OO
to	OO
europe	OU
spread	OO
far	OO
and	OO
wide	,O
inspiring	OO
all	OO
the	OO
explorers	OO
and	OO
settlers	OO
who	OO
came	OO
after	.O
without	OU
him	,O
none	OO
of	OO
us	OO
would	OO
be	OO
here	OO
today	.O
and	OU
because	OO
of	OO
him	,O
millions	OO
of	OO
native	OU
americans	OU
aren't	OO
here	OO
today	.O
do	OU
you	OO
know	OO
what	OO
columbus	OU
did	OO
in	OO
the	OO
colonies	OO
he	OO
founded	?O
he	OU
took	OO
the	OO
very	OO
first	OO
natives	OO
he	OO
met	OO
prisoner	OO
and	OO
wrote	OO
in	OO
his	OO
journal	OO
about	OO
how	OO

he	OO
could	OO
conquer	OO

all	OO

oh	,U
come	OO
on	.O
everyone	OU
was	OO
fighting	OO
each	OO
other	OO
back	OO
then	.O
didn't	OU
the	OO
natives	OO
even	OO
tell	OO
columbus	OU
about	OO
other	OO
tribes	OO
raiding	OO
and	OO
taking	OO
captives	?O
yes	,U
but	OO
tribal	OO
warfare	OO
was	OO
sporadic	OO
and	OO
limited	.O
it	OU
certainly	OO
didn't	OO
wipe	OO
out	OO
90%	OO
of	OO
the	OO
population	.O
hmm	.U
why	OU
is	OO
celebrating	OO
this	OO
columbus	OU
so	OO
important	OO
to	OO
you	,O
anyway	?O
your	OU
honor	,U
columbus's	OU
voyage	OO

an	OO
inspiration	OO
to	OO

people	OO
all	OO
across	OO
europe	,U
symbolizing	OO
freedom	OO

new	OO

his	OO

the	OO
chance	OO
to	OO
come	OO
here	OO
and	OO
build	OO
better	OO
lives	OO
for	OO

don't	OU
we	OO
deserve	OO
a	OO
hero	OO
to	OO
remind	OO
everyone	OO
that	OO
our	OO
country	OO
was	OO
build	OO
on	OO
the	OO
struggles	OO
of	OO

what	OO
about	OO

out	OO

that's	OU

a	OO

in	OO
the	OO
15th	OO

by	OO

people	OU
back	OO
then	OO
even	OO

spreading	OO
christianity	OU

civilization	OO
across	OO
the	OO

was	OO
a	OO
moral	OO

actually	,U
he	OO
was	OO
pretty	OO
bad	,O
even	OO
by	OO
old	OO
standards	.O
while	OU
governing	OO
hispaniola	,U
he	OO
tortured	OO

him	OO
enough	OO
gold	OO
and	OO
sold	OO
girls	OO
as	OO

nine	OO
into	OO

and	OO
he	OO
was	OO
brutal	OO
even	OO
to	OO
the	OO

he	OO
ruled	,O
to	OO
the	OO
point	OO
that	OO
he	OO
was	OO
removed	OO
from	OO

when	OU
the	OO
missionary	,O

who	OU

will	OO
believe	OO
this?'	OO
well	,U
i'm	OU
not	OO
sure	OO
i	OU
believe	OO
those	OO
numbers	.O
say	,U
aren't	OO
there	OO
other	OO
ways	OO
the	OO
holiday	OO
is	OO
celebrated	?O
in	OU
some	OO
latin	OU
american	OU
countries	,O
they	OO
celebrate	OO
the	OO
same	OO
date	OO
under	OO
different	OO
names	,O
such	OO
as	OO
día	OU
de	OO
la	OO
raza	.U
in	OU
these	OO
places	,O
it's	OO
more	OO
a	OO
celebration	OO
of	OO
the	OO
native	OO
and	OO
mixed	OO
cultures	OO
that	OO
survived	OO
through	OO
the	OO
colonial	OO
period	.O
some	OU
places	OO
in	OO
the	OO
u.s	.U
have	OO
also	OO
renamed	OO
the	OO
holiday	,O
as	OO
native	OU
american	OU
day	OU
or	OO
indigenous	OU
people's	OU
day	OU
and	OO
changed	OO
the	OO
celebrations	OO
accordingly	.O
so	,U
why	OO
not	OO
just	OO
change	OO
the	OO
name	OO
if	OO
it's	OO
such	OO
a	OO
problem	?O
because	OU
it's	OO
tradition	.O
ordinary	OU
people	OO
need	OO
their	OO
heroes	OO
and	OO
their	OO
founding	OO
myths	.O
can't	OU
we	OO
just	OO
keep	OO
celebrating	OO
the	OO
way	OO
we've	OO
been	OO
doing	OO
for	OO
a	OO
century	,O
without	OO
having	OO
to	OO
delve	OO
into	OO
all	OO
this	OO
serious	OO
research	?O
it's	OU
not	OO
like	OO
anyone	OO
is	OO
actually	OO
celebrating	OO
genocide	.O
traditions	OU
change	,O
and	OO
the	OO
way	OO
we	OO
choose	OO
to	OO
keep	OO
them	OO
alive	OO
says	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
about	OO
our	OO
values	.O
well	,U
it	OO
looks	OO
like	OO
giving	OO
tired	OO
judges	OO
a	OO
day	OO
off	OO
isn't	OO
one	OO
of	OO
those	OO
values	,O
anyway	.O
traditions	OU
and	OO
holidays	OO
are	OO
important	OO
to	OO
all	OO
cultures	,O
but	OO
a	OO
hero	OO
in	OO
one	OO
era	OO
may	OO
become	OO
a	OO
villain	OO
in	OO
the	OO
next	OO
as	OO
our	OO
historical	OO
knowledge	OO
expands	OO
and	OO
our	OO
values	OO
evolve	.O
and	OU
deciding	OO
what	OO
these	OO
traditions	OO
should	OO
mean	OO
today	OO
is	OO
a	OO
major	OO
part	OO
of	OO
putting	OO
history	OO
on	OO
trial	.O
so	OU
in	OO
the	OO
run	OO
up	OO
to	OO
the	OO
2016	OO
election	,O
i	OU
was	,O
like	OO
most	OO
of	OO
us	,O
watching	OO
the	OO
rise	OO
in	OO
discord	OO
and	OO
vitriol	OO
and	OO
nastiness	OO
in	OO
our	OO
public	OO
spaces	.O
it	OU
was	OO
this	OO
crazy	OO
uptick	OO
in	OO
polarization	.O
it	OU
was	OO
both	OO
disheartening	OO
and	OO
distressing	.O
and	OU
so	OO
i	OU
started	OO
thinking	,O
with	OO
a	OO
fellow	OO
journalist	,O
jeremy	OU
hay	,U
about	OO
how	OO
we	OO
might	OO
practice	OO
our	OO
craft	OO
differently	.O
how	OU
we	OO
might	OO
go	OO
to	OO
the	OO
heart	OO
of	OO
divides	,O
to	OO
places	OO
of	OO
conflict	,O
like	OO
journalists	OO
always	OO
have	,O
but	OO
then	,O
once	OO
there	,O
do	OO
something	OO
really	OO
different	.O
we	OU
knew	OO
we	OO
wanted	OO
to	OO
take	OO
the	OO
core	OO
tools	OO
of	OO
our	OO
craft	OO
—	OO
careful	OO
vetting	OO
of	OO
information	,O
diligent	OO
research	,O
curiosity	,O
a	OO
commitment	OO
to	OO
serving	OO
the	OO
public	OO
good	OO
—	OO
to	OO
serving	OO
our	OO
democracy	OO
—	OO
and	OO
do	OO
something	OO
new	.O
and	OU
so	OO
we	OO
mapped	OO
out	OO
this	OO
process	,O
what	OO
we	OO
call	OO
dialogue	OO
journalism	,O
for	OO
going	OO
to	OO
the	OO
heart	OO
of	OO
social	OO
and	OO
political	OO
divides	,O
and	OO
then	,O
once	OO
there	,O
building	OO
journalism	OO
supported	OO
conversations	OO
between	OO
people	OO
on	OO
opposite	OO
sides	OO
of	OO
polarizing	OO
issues	.O
but	OU
how	OO
actually	OO
to	OO
do	OO
this	OO
in	OO
a	OO
world	OO
that's	OO
so	OO
divided	,O
so	OO
deeply	OO
divided	OO
—	OO
when	OO
we	OO
live	OO
in	OO
a	OO
world	OO
in	OO
which	OO
cousins	OO
and	OO
aunts	OO
and	OO
uncles	OO
can't	OO
talk	OO
to	OO
one	OO
another	,O
when	OO
we	OO
often	OO
live	OO
in	OO
separate	OO
and	OO
distinct	OO
news	OO
ecosystems	,O
and	OO
when	OO
we	OO
reflexively	OO
and	OO
habitually	OO
malign	OO
and	OO
dismiss	OO
those	OO
with	OO
whom	OO
we	OO
disagree	?O
but	OU
we	OO
wanted	OO
to	OO
try	.O
and	OU
so	OO
right	OO
after	OO
the	OO
2016	OO
election	,O
in	OO
that	OO
time	OO
between	OO
the	OO
election	OO
and	OO
the	OO
inauguration	,O
we	OO
partnered	OO
with	OO
the	OO
alabama	OU
media	OU
group	OU
to	OO
do	OO
something	OO
really	OO
different	.O
we	OU
brought	OO
25	OO
trump	OU
supporters	OO
from	OO
alabama	OU
together	OO
in	OO
conversation	OO
with	OO
25	OO
clinton	OU
supporters	OO
from	OO
california	.U
and	OU
we	OO
brought	OO
them	OO
together	OO
in	OO
a	OO
closed	,O
moderated	OO
facebook	OU
group	OO
that	OO
we	OO
kept	OO
open	OO
for	OO
a	OO
month	.O
what	OU
we	OO
wanted	OO
to	OO
do	OO
was	OO
to	OO
give	OO
them	OO
a	OO
place	OO
to	OO
engage	OO
with	OO
genuine	OO
curiosity	OO
and	OO
openness	.O
and	OU
we	OO
wanted	OO
to	OO
support	OO
them	OO
in	OO
building	OO
relationships	,O
not	OO
just	OO
with	OO
each	OO
other	OO
but	OO
with	OO
us	OO
as	OO
journalists	.O
and	OU
then	OO
we	OO
wanted	OO
to	OO
supply	OO
facts	OO
and	OO
information	OO
—	OO
facts	OO
and	OO
information	OO
that	OO
they	OO
could	OO
actually	OO
receive	OO
and	OO
process	OO
and	OO
use	OO
to	OO
undergird	OO
their	OO
conversations	.O
and	OU
so	OO
as	OO
a	OO
prelude	OO
to	OO
this	OO
conversation	,O
the	OO
first	OO
step	OO
in	OO
what	OO
we	OO
call	OO
dialogue	OO
journalism	,O
we	OO
asked	OO
what	OO
they	OO
thought	OO
the	OO
other	OO
side	OO
thought	OO
of	OO
them	.O
so	OU
when	OO
we	OO
asked	OO
the	OO
trump	OU
supporters	OO
from	OO
alabama	OU
what	OO
they	OO
thought	OO
the	OO
clinton	OU
supporters	OO
in	OO
california	OU
thought	OO
of	OO
them	,O
this	OO
is	OO
some	OO
of	OO
what	OO
they	OO
said	.O
they	OU
think	OO
we	OO
are	OO
religious	OO
bible	OU
thumpers	.O
that	OU
we're	OO
backwards	OO
and	OO
hickish	,O
and	OO
stupid	.O
they	OU
think	OO
that	OO
we	OO
all	OO
have	OO
confederate	OU
flags	OO
in	OO
our	OO
yards	,O
that	OO
we're	OO
racist	OO
and	OO
sexist	OO
and	OO
uneducated	.O
they	OU
think	OO
we're	OO
barefoot	OO
and	OO
pregnant	,O
with	OO
dirt	OO
driveways	.O
and	OU
they	OO
think	OO
we're	OO
all	OO
prissy	OO
butts	OO
and	OO
that	OO
we	OO
walk	OO
around	OO
in	OO
hoop	OO
skirts	OO
with	OO
cotton	OO
fields	OO
in	OO
the	OO
background	.O
and	OU
then	OO
we	OO
asked	OO
that	OO
same	OO
question	OO
of	OO
the	OO
californians:	OU
what	OU
do	OO
you	OO
think	OO
the	OO
alabamians	OU
think	OO
about	OO
you	?O
and	OU
they	OO
said	OO
this:	OO
that	OU
we're	OO
crazy	,O
liberal	OO
californians	.U
that	OU
we're	OO
not	OO
patriotic	.O
we're	OU
snobby	OO
and	OO
we're	OO
elitist	.O
we're	OU
godless	OO
and	OO
we're	OO
permissive	OO
with	OO
our	OO
children	.O
and	OU
that	OO
we're	OO
focused	OO
on	OO
our	OO
careers	,O
not	OO
our	OO
family	.O
that	OU
we're	OO
elitist	,O
pie	OO
in	OO
the	OO
sky	OO
intellectuals	,O
rich	OO
people	,O
whole	OU
foods	OU
eating	,O
very	OO
out	OO
of	OO
touch	.O
so	OU
by	OO
asking	OO
questions	OO
like	OO
this	OO
at	OO
the	OO
start	OO
of	OO
every	OO
conversation	OO
and	OO
by	OO
identifying	OO
and	OO
sharing	OO
stereotypes	,O
we	OO
find	OO
that	OO
people	OO
—	OO
people	OO
on	OO
all	OO
sides	OO
—	OO
begin	OO
to	OO
see	OO
the	OO
simplistic	OO
and	OO
often	OO
mean	OO
spirited	OO
caricatures	OO
they	OO
carry	.O
and	OU
in	OO
that	OO
—	OO
after	OO
that	,O
we	OO
can	OO
move	OO
into	OO
a	OO
process	OO
of	OO
genuine	OO
conversation	.O
so	OU
in	OO
the	OO
two	OO
years	OO
since	OO
that	OO
launch	OO
—	OO
california/alabama	OU
project	OU
—	OO
we've	OO
gone	OO
on	OO
to	OO
host	OO
dialogues	OO
and	OO
partnerships	OO
with	OO
media	OO
organizations	OO
across	OO
the	OO
country	.O
and	OU
they've	OO
been	OO
about	OO
some	OO
of	OO
our	OO
most	OO
contentious	OO
issues:	OO
guns	,O
immigration	,O
race	,O
education	.O
and	OU
what	OO
we	OO
found	,O
remarkably	,O
is	OO
that	OO
real	OO
dialogue	OO
is	OO
in	OO
fact	OO
possible	.O
and	OU
that	OO
when	OO
given	OO
a	OO
chance	OO
and	OO
structure	OO
around	OO
doing	OO
so	,O
many	,O
not	OO
all	,O
but	OO
many	OO
of	OO
our	OO
fellow	OO
citizens	OO
are	OO
eager	OO
to	OO
engage	OO
with	OO
the	OO
other	.O
too	OU
often	OO
journalists	OO
have	OO
sharpened	OO
divides	OO
in	OO
the	OO
name	OO
of	OO
drama	OO
or	OO
readership	OO
or	OO
in	OO
service	OO
to	OO
our	OO
own	OO
views	.O
and	OU
too	OO
often	OO
we've	OO
gone	OO
to	OO
each	OO
side	OO
quoting	OO
a	OO
partisan	OO
voice	OO
on	OO
one	OO
side	OO
and	OO
a	OO
partisan	OO
voice	OO
on	OO
the	OO
other	OO
with	OO
a	OO
telling	OO
anecdotal	OO
lead	OO
and	OO
a	OO
pithy	OO
final	OO
quote	,O
all	OO
of	OO
which	OO
readers	OO
are	OO
keen	OO
to	OO
mine	OO
for	OO
bias	.O
but	OU
our	OO
dialogue	OO
based	OO
process	OO
has	OO
a	OO
slower	OO
pace	OO
and	OO
a	OO
different	OO
center	.O
and	OU
our	OO
work	OO
is	OO
guided	OO
by	OO
the	OO
principle	OO
that	OO
dialogue	OO
across	OO
difference	OO
is	OO
essential	OO
to	OO
a	OO
functioning	OO
democracy	,O
and	OO
that	OO
journalism	OO
and	OO
journalists	OO
have	OO
a	OO
multifaceted	OO
role	OO
to	OO
play	OO
in	OO
supporting	OO
that	.O
so	OU
how	OO
do	OO
we	OO
work	?O
at	OU
every	OO

about	OO

at	OU
every	OO

we	OO
take	OO

explain	OO
why	OO
we're	OO
doing	OO
what	OO

we	OU

that	OO
it's	OO

there	OO
to	OO

you	OO
you're	OO

no	OO
one's	OO
there	OO
to	OO
tell	OO
you	OO
your	OO

and	OU
we	OO
always	OO
ask	OO
for	OO
a	OO

sort	OO
of	OO
behavior	,O
a	OO
repatterning	OO
away	OO
from	OO
the	OO

so	OO
entrenched	OO
in	OO

that	OO
most	OO
of	OO
us	,O
on	OO
all	OO

don't	OO
even	OO

so	OU
people	OO
often	OO
come	OO
into	OO
our	OO

a	OO

they	OU
say	OO
things	OO

how	OU

you	OO

generally	,O
in	OO
this	OO

that	OO

us	OO
every	OO

who	OO
they	OO

where	OO
they	OO
come	OO
from	,O

they	OO

of	OO
one	OO
another	.O
and	OU
slowly	,O
over	OO

people	OO

back	OO
again	OO

again	OO
to	OO
difficult	OO
topics	,O
each	OO

with	OO
a	OO
little	OO

a	OO
little	OO
more	OO

a	OO
little	OO

curiosity	.O
and	OU
our	OO
journalists	OO
and	OO
moderators	OO
work	OO
really	OO
hard	OO
to	OO
support	OO
this	OO
because	OO
it's	OO
not	OO
a	OO
debate	,O
it's	OO
not	OO
a	OO
battle	,O
it's	OO
not	OO
a	OO
sunday	OU
morning	OO
talk	OO
show	.O
it's	OU
not	OO
the	OO
flinging	OO
of	OO
talking	OO

it's	OU
not	OO
the	OO
stacking	OO
of	OO

with	OO

that	OO

and	OU
it's	OO
not	OO
about	OO
scoring	OO
political	OO
victories	OO
with	OO

so	OU
what	OO
we've	OO
learned	OO
is	OO
that	OO
our	OO

is	OO
bad	OO
for	OO
everyone	.O
it	OU
is	OO
a	OO
deeply	OO

state	OO
of	OO

and	OU
people	OO
tell	OO
us	OO
this	OO
again	OO

they	OU

they	OO
appreciate	OO
the	OO

with	OO

with	OO

that	OO

for	OO
a	OO

we	OO

to	OO
the	OO

the	OO

the	OU

when	OO

when	OO

to	OO
gratitude	.O
today	,U
we	OO
no	OO
longer	OO
rely	OO
on	OO
pots	OO
to	OO
identify	OO
seismic	OO
events	,O
but	OO
earthquakes	OO
still	OO
offer	OO
a	OO
unique	OO
challenge	OO
to	OO
those	OO
trying	OO
to	OO
track	OO
them	.O
so	OU
why	OO
are	OO
earthquakes	OO
so	OO
hard	OO
to	OO
anticipate	,O
and	OO
how	OO
could	OO
we	OO
get	OO
better	OO
at	OO
predicting	OO
them	?O
to	OU
answer	OO
that	,O
we	OO
need	OO
to	OO
understand	OO
some	OO
theories	OO
behind	OO
how	OO
earthquakes	OO
occur	.O
earth’s	OU
crust	OO
is	OO
made	OO
from	OO
several	OO
vast	,O
jagged	OO
slabs	OO
of	OO
rock	OO
called	OO
tectonic	OO
plates	,O
each	OO
riding	OO
on	OO
a	OO
hot	,O
partially	OO
molten	OO
layer	OO
of	OO
earth’s	OU
mantle	.O
this	OU
causes	OO
the	OO
plates	OO
to	OO
spread	OO
very	OO
slowly	,O
at	OO
anywhere	OO
from	OO
1	OO
to	OO
20	OO
centimeters	OO
per	OO
year	.O
but	OU
these	OO
tiny	OO
movements	OO
are	OO
powerful	OO
enough	OO
to	OO
cause	OO
deep	OO
cracks	OO
in	OO
the	OO
interacting	OO
plates	.O
and	OU
in	OO
unstable	OO
zones	,O
the	OO
intensifying	OO
pressure	OO
may	OO
ultimately	OO
trigger	OO
an	OO
earthquake	.O
it’s	OU
hard	OO
enough	OO
to	OO
monitor	OO
these	OO
miniscule	OO
movements	,O
but	OO
the	OO
factors	OO
that	OO
turn	OO
shifts	OO
into	OO
seismic	OO
events	OO
are	OO
far	OO
more	OO
varied	.O
different	OU
fault	OO
lines	OO
juxtapose	OO
different	OO
rocks–	OO
some	OO
of	OO
which	OO
are	OO
stronger–or	OO
weaker–	OO
under	OO
pressure	.O
diverse	OU
rocks	OO
also	OO
react	OO
differently	OO
to	OO
friction	OO
and	OO
high	OO
temperatures	.O
some	OU
partially	OO
melt	,O
and	OO
can	OO
release	OO
lubricating	OO
fluids	OO
made	OO
of	OO
superheated	OO
minerals	OO
that	OO
reduce	OO
fault	OO
line	OO
friction	.O
but	OU
some	OO
are	OO
left	OO
dry	,O
prone	OO
to	OO
dangerous	OO
build	OO
ups	OO
of	OO
pressure	.O
and	OU
all	OO
these	OO
faults	OO
are	OO
subject	OO
to	OO
varying	OO
gravitational	OO
forces	,O
as	OO
well	OO
as	OO
the	OO
currents	OO
of	OO
hot	OO
rocks	OO
moving	OO
throughout	OO
earth’s	OU
mantle	.O
so	OU
which	OO
of	OO
these	OO
hidden	OO
variables	OO
should	OO
we	OO
be	OO
analyzing	,O
and	OO
how	OO
do	OO
they	OO
fit	OO
into	OO
our	OO
growing	OO
prediction	OO
toolkit	?O
because	OU
some	OO
of	OO
these	OO
forces	OO
occur	OO
at	OO
largely	OO
constant	OO
rates	,O
the	OO
behavior	OO
of	OO
the	OO
plates	OO
is	OO
somewhat	OO
cyclical	.O
today	,U
many	OO
of	OO
our	OO
most	OO
reliable	OO
clues	OO
come	OO
from	OO
long	OO
term	OO
forecasting	,O
related	OO
to	OO
when	OO
and	OO
where	OO
earthquakes	OO
have	OO
previously	OO
occurred	.O
at	OU
the	OO
scale	OO
of	OO
millennia	,O
this	OO
allows	OO
us	OO
to	OO
make	OO
predictions	OO
about	OO
when	OO
highly	OO
active	OO
faults	,O
like	OO
the	OO
san	OU
andreas	,U
are	OO
overdue	OO
for	OO
a	OO
massive	OO
earthquake	.O
but	OU
due	OO
to	OO
the	OO
many	OO
variables	OO
involved	,O
this	OO
method	OO
can	OO
only	OO
predict	OO
very	OO
loose	OO
timeframes	.O
to	OU
predict	OO
more	OO
imminent	OO
events	,O
researchers	OO
have	OO
investigated	OO
the	OO
vibrations	OO
earth	OU
elicits	OO
before	OO
a	OO
quake	.O
geologists	OU
have	OO
long	OO
used	OO
seismometers	OO
to	OO
track	OO
and	OO
map	OO
these	OO
tiny	OO
shifts	OO
in	OO
the	OO
earth’s	OO
crust	.O
and	OU
today	,O
most	OO
smartphones	OO
are	OO
also	OO
capable	OO
of	OO
recording	OO
primary	OO
seismic	OO
waves	.O
with	OU
a	OO
network	OO
of	OO

around	OO
the	OO

scientists	OO
could	OO
potentially	OO
crowdsource	OO
a	OO
rich	,O

that	OO

but	OU
such	OO

be	OO
useful	OO
for	OO

like	OO

which	OO

use	OO
a	OO
rigorous	OO

of	OO

to	OO

however	,U

in	OU
2011	,O
just	OO
before	OO
an	OO

struck	OO
the	OO
east	OO

of	OO
japan	,U

recorded	OO
surprisingly	OO
high	OO

of	OO
the	OO

as	OU

these	OU

that	OO

in	OO

of	OU

none	OO

as	OO
simply	OO
looking	OO

itself	.O
with	OU
a	OO

we	OO
might	OO
be	OO

to	OO

in	OO

possibly	OO

for	OO
now	,O
these	OO

without	OO
waiting	OO
for	OO

from	OO
a	OO

so	,U
2014	OO
was	OO
a	OO
big	OO
year	OO
for	OO
me	.O
do	OU
you	OO
ever	OO
have	OO
that	,O
just	OO
like	OO
a	OO
big	OO
year	,O
like	OO
a	OO
banner	OO
year	?O
for	OU
me	,O
it	OO
went	OO
like	OO
this:	OO
october	OU
3	,O
i	OU
lost	OO
my	OO
second	OO
pregnancy	.O
and	OU
then	OO
october	OU
8	,O
my	OO
dad	OO
died	OO
of	OO
cancer	.O
and	OU
then	OO
on	OO
november	OU
25	,O
my	OO
husband	OO
aaron	OU
died	OO
after	OO
three	OO
years	OO
with	OO
stage	OO
four	OO
glioblastoma	,O
which	OO
is	OO
just	OO
a	OO
fancy	OO
word	OO
for	OO
brain	OO
cancer	.O
so	,U
i'm	OU
fun	.O
people	OU
love	OO
to	OO
invite	OO
me	OO
out	OO
all	OO
the	OO
time	.O
packed	OU
social	OO
life	.O
usually	,U
when	OO
i	OU
talk	OO
about	OO
this	OO
period	OO
of	OO
my	OO
life	,O
the	OO
reaction	OO
i	OU
get	OO
is	OO
essentially:	OO
i	OU
can't	OO
—	OO
i	OU
can't	OO
imagine	.O
but	OU
i	OU
do	OO
think	OO
you	OO
can	.O
i	OU
think	OO
you	OO
can	.O
and	OU
i	OU
think	OO
that	OO
you	OO
should	OO
because	,O
someday	,O
it's	OO
going	OO
to	OO
happen	OO
to	OO
you	.O
maybe	OU
not	OO
these	OO
specific	OO
losses	OO
in	OO
this	OO
specific	OO
order	OO
or	OO
at	OO
this	OO
speed	,O
but	OO
like	OO
i	OU
said	,O
i'm	OU
very	OO
fun	OO
and	OO
the	OO
research	OO
that	OO
i	OU
have	OO
seen	OO
will	OO
stun	OO
you:	OO
everyone	OO
you	OO
love	OO
has	OO
a	OO
100	OO
percent	OO
chance	OO
of	OO
dying	.O
and	OU
that's	OO
why	OO
you	OO
came	OO
to	OO
ted	.U
so	,U
since	OO
all	OO
of	OO
this	OO
loss	OO
happened	,O
i've	OU
made	OO
it	OO
a	OO
career	OO
to	OO
talk	OO
about	OO
death	OO
and	OO
loss	,O
not	OO
just	OO
my	OO
own	,O
because	OO
it's	OO
pretty	OO
easy	OO
to	OO
recap	,O
but	OO
the	OO
losses	OO
and	OO
tragedies	OO
that	OO
other	OO
people	OO
have	OO
experienced	.O
it's	OU
a	OO
niche	,O
i	OU
have	OO
to	OO
say	.O
it's	OU
a	OO
small	OO
niche	,O
and	OO
i	OU
wish	OO
i	OU
made	OO
more	OO
money	,O
but	.O
i've	OU
written	OO
some	OO
very	OO
uplifting	OO
books	,O
host	OO
a	OO
very	OO
uplifting	OO
podcast	,O
i	OU
started	OO
a	OO
little	OO
nonprofit	.O
i'm	OU
just	OO
trying	OO
to	OO
do	OO
what	OO
i	OU
can	OO
to	OO
make	OO
more	OO
people	OO
comfortable	OO
with	OO
the	OO
uncomfortable	,O
and	OO
grief	OO
is	OO
so	OO
uncomfortable	.O
it's	OU
so	OO
uncomfortable	,O
especially	OO
if	OO
it's	OO
someone	OO
else's	OO
grief	.O
so	OU
part	OO
of	OO
that	OO
work	OO
is	OO
this	OO
group	OO
that	OO
i	OU
started	OO
with	OO
my	OO
friend	OO
moe	,U
who	OO
is	OO
also	OO
a	OO
widow;	OO
we	OO
call	OO
it	OO
the	OO
hot	OU
young	OU
widows	OU
club	.U
and	OU
it's	OO
real	,O
we	OO
have	OO
membership	OO
cards	OO
and	OO
t	OU
shirts	.O
and	OU
when	OO
your	OO
person	OO
dies	,O
your	OO
husband	,O
wife	,O
girlfriend	,O
boyfriend	,O
literally	OO
don't	OO
care	OO
if	OO
you	OO
were	OO
married	,O
your	OO
friends	OO
and	OO
your	OO
family	OO
are	OO
just	OO
going	OO
to	OO
look	OO
around	OO
through	OO
friends	OO
of	OO
friends	OO
of	OO
friends	OO
of	OO
friends	OO
until	OO
they	OO
find	OO
someone	OO
who's	OO
gone	OO
through	OO
something	OO
similar	,O
and	OO
then	OO
they'll	OO
push	OO
you	OO
towards	OO
each	OO
other	OO
so	OO
you	OO
can	OO
talk	OO
amongst	OO
yourselves	OO
and	OO
not	OO
get	OO
your	OO
sad	OO
on	OO
other	OO
people	.O
so	OU
that's	OO
what	OO
we	OO
do	.O
it's	OU
just	OO
a	OO
series	OO
of	OO
small	OO
groups	,O
where	OO
men	,O
women	,O
gay	,O
straight	,O
married	,O
partnered	,O
can	OO
talk	OO
about	OO
their	OO
dead	OO
person	,O
and	OO
say	OO
the	OO
things	OO
that	OO
the	OO
other	OO
people	OO
in	OO
their	OO
lives	OO
aren't	OO
ready	OO
or	OO
willing	OO
to	OO
hear	OO
yet	.O
huge	OU
range	OO
of	OO
conversations	.O
like	,U
my	OU
husband	OO
died	OO
two	OO
weeks	OO
ago	,O
i	OU
can't	OO
stop	OO
thinking	OO
about	OO
sex	,O
is	OO
that	OO
normal	?O
yeah	.U
what	OU
if	OO
it's	OO
one	OO
of	OO
the	OO
property	OU
brothers	?U
less	OU
normal	,O
but	OO
i'll	OU
accept	OO
it	.O
things	OU
like	,O
look	,U
when	OO
i'm	OU
out	OO
in	OO
public	OO
and	OO
i	OU
see	OO
old	OO
people	OO
holding	OO
hands	,O
couples	OO
who	OO
have	OO
clearly	OO
been	OO
together	OO
for	OO
decades	,O
and	OO
then	OO
i	OU
look	OO
at	OO
them	OO
and	OO
i	OU
imagine	OO
all	OO
of	OO
the	OO
things	OO
they've	OO
been	OO
through	OO
together	,O
the	OO
good	OO
things	,O
the	OO
bad	OO
things	,O
the	OO
arguments	OO
they've	OO
had	OO
over	OO
who	OO
should	OO
take	OO
out	OO
the	OO
trash	.O
i	OU
just	OO
find	OO
my	OO
heart	OO
filled	OO
with	OO
rage	.O
and	OU
that	OO
example	OO
is	OO
personal	OO
to	OO
me	.O
most	OU
of	OO
the	OO
conversations	OO
that	OO
we	OO
have	OO
in	OO
the	OO
group	OO
can	OO
and	OO
will	OO
just	OO
stay	OO
amongst	OO
ourselves	,O
but	OO
there	OO
are	OO
things	OO
that	OO
we	OO
talk	OO
about	OO
that	OO
the	OO
rest	OO
of	OO
the	OO
world	OO
—	OO
the	OO
world	OO
that	OO
is	OO
grief	OO
adjacent	OO
but	OO
not	OO
yet	OO
grief	OO
stricken	OO
—	OO
could	OO
really	OO
benefit	OO
from	OO
hearing	.O
and	OU
if	OO
you	OO
can't	OO
tell	,O
i'm	OU
only	OO
interested	OO
in	OO
/	OO
capable	OO
of	OO
unscientific	OO
studies	,O
so	OO
what	OO
i	OU
did	OO
was	OO
go	OO
to	OO
the	OU
hot	OU
young	OU
widows	OU
club	OU
and	OO
say	,O
hello	,U
friends	,O
remember	OO
when	OO
your	OO
person	OO
died	?O
they	OU
did	.O
do	OU
you	OO
remember	OO
all	OO
the	OO
things	OO
people	OO
said	OO
to	OO
you	?O
oh	,U
yeah	.O
which	OU
ones	OO
did	OO

a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
comments	,O
lot	OO
of	OO
answers	,O
people	OO
say	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
things	,O
but	OO
two	OO
rose	OO
to	OO
the	OO
top	OO
pretty	OO
quickly	.O
moving	OU
on	.O
now	,U
since	OO
2014	,O
i	OU
will	OO
tell	OO
you	OO
i	OU
have	OO
remarried	OO
a	OO
very	OO
handsome	OO
man	OO
named	OO
matthew	,U
we	OO
have	OO
four	OO
children	OO
in	OO
our	OO
blended	OO
family	,O
we	OO
live	OO
in	OO
the	OO
suburbs	OO
of	OO
minneapolis	,U
minnesota	,U
usa	.U
we	OU
have	OO
a	OO
rescue	OO
dog	.O
i	OU
drive	OO
a	OO
minivan	,O
like	OO
the	OO
kind	OO
where	OO
doors	OO
open	OO
and	OO
i	OU
don't	OO
even	OO
touch	OO
them	.O
like	,U
by	OO
any	OO
mezhure	,O
life	OO
is	OO
good	.O
i've	OU
also	OO
never	OO
said	OO
mezhure	,O
i've	OU
never	OO
once	OO
said	OO
it	OO
that	OO
way	.O
i	OU
don't	OO
know	OO
where	OO
that	OO
came	OO
from	.O
i've	OU
never	OO
heard	OO
anyone	OO
else	OO
say	OO
it	OO
that	OO
way	.O
it	OU
looks	OO
like	OO
it	OO
should	OO
be	OO
said	OO
that	OO
way	,O
and	OO
that's	OO
why	OO
the	OO
english	OU
language	OO
is	OO
trash	,O
so	.O
so	OU
impressed	OO
with	OO
anyone	OO
who	,O
like	,O
speaks	OO
it	OO
in	OO
addition	OO
to	OO
a	OO
language	OO
that	OO
makes	OO
sense	OO
—	OO
good	OO
job	.O
but	OU
by	OO
any	OO
measure	.O
by	OU
any	OO
measure	,O
life	OO
is	OO
really	,O
really	OO
good	,O
but	OO
i	OU
haven't	OO
moved	OO
on	.O
i	OU
haven't	OO
moved	OO
on	,O
and	OO
i	OU
hate	OO
that	OO
phrase	OO
so	OO
much	,O
and	OO
i	OU
understand	OO
why	OO
other	OO
people	OO
do	.O
because	OU
what	OO
it	OO
says	OO
is	OO
that	OO
aaron's	OU
life	OO
and	OO
death	OO
and	OO
love	OO
are	OO
just	OO
moments	OO
that	OO
i	OU
can	OO
leave	OO
behind	OO
me	OO
—	OO
and	OO
that	OO
i	OU
probably	OO
should	.O
and	OU
when	OO
i	OU
talk	OO
about	OO
aaron	,U
i	OU
slip	OO
so	OO
easily	OO
into	OO
the	OO
present	OO
tense	,O
and	OO
i've	OU
always	OO
thought	OO
that	OO
made	OO
me	OO
weird	.O
and	OU
then	OO
i	OU
noticed	OO
that	OO
everybody	OO
does	OO
it	.O
and	OU
it's	OO
not	OO
because	OO
we	OO
are	OO
in	OO
denial	OO
or	OO
because	OO
we're	OO
forgetful	,O
it's	OO
because	OO
the	OO
people	OO
we	OO
love	,O
who	OO
we've	OO
lost	,O
are	OO
still	OO
so	OO
present	OO
for	OO
us	.O
so	,U
when	OO
i	OU
say	,O
oh	,U
aaron	OU
is	.O
it's	OU
because	OO
aaron	OU
still	OO
is	.O
and	OU
it's	OO
not	OO
in	OO
the	OO
way	OO
that	OO
he	OO
was	OO
before	,O
which	OO
was	OO
much	OO
better	,O
and	OO
it's	OO
not	OO
in	OO
the	OO
way	OO
that	OO
churchy	OO
people	OO
try	OO
to	OO
tell	OO
me	OO
that	OO
he	OO
would	OO
be	.O
it's	OU
just	OO
that	OO
he's	OO
indelible	,O
and	OO
so	OO
he	OO
is	OO
present	OO
for	OO
me	.O
here	,U
he's	OO
present	OO
for	OO
me	OO
in	OO
the	OO
work	OO
that	OO
i	OU
do	,O
in	OO
the	OO
child	OO
that	OO
we	OO
had	OO
together	,O
in	OO
these	OO
three	OO
other	OO
children	OO
i'm	OU
raising	,O
who	OO
never	OO
met	OO
him	,O
who	OO
share	OO
none	OO
of	OO
his	OO
dna	,U
but	OO
who	OO
are	OO
only	OO
in	OO
my	OO
life	OO
because	OO
i	OU
had	OO
aaron	OU
and	OO
because	OO
i	OU
lost	OO
aaron	.U
he's	OU
present	OO
in	OO
my	OO
marriage	OO
to	OO
matthew	,U
because	OO
aaron's	OU
life	OO
and	OO
love	OO
and	OO
death	OO
made	OO
me	OO
the	OO
person	OO
that	OO
matthew	OU
wanted	OO
to	OO
marry	.O
so	OU
i've	OU
not	OO
moved	OO
on	OO
from	OO
aaron	,U
i've	OU
moved	OO
forward	OO
with	OO
him	.O
we	OU
spread	OO
aaron's	OU
ashes	OO
in	OO
his	OO
favorite	OO
river	OO
in	OO
minnesota	,U
and	OO
when	OO
the	OO
bag	OO
was	OO
empty	OO
—	OO
because	OO
when	OO
you're	OO
cremated	,O
you	OO
fit	OO
into	OO
a	OO
plastic	OO
bag	OO
—	OO
there	OO
were	OO
still	OO
ashes	OO
stuck	OO
to	OO
my	OO
fingers	.O
and	OU
i	OU
could	OO
have	OO
just	OO
put	OO
my	OO
hands	OO
in	OO
the	OO
water	OO
and	OO
rinsed	OO
them	,O
but	OO
instead	,O
i	OU
licked	OO
my	OO
hands	OO
clean	,O
because	OO
i	OU
was	OO
so	OO
afraid	OO
of	OO
losing	OO
more	OO
than	OO
i	OU
had	OO
already	OO
lost	,O
and	OO
i	OU
was	OO
so	OO
desperate	OO
to	OO
make	OO
sure	OO
that	OO
he	OO
would	OO
always	OO
be	OO
a	OO
part	OO
of	OO
me	.O
but	OU
of	OO
course	OO
he	OO
would	OO
be	.O
because	OU
when	OO
you	OO
watch	OO
your	OO
person	OO
fill	OO
himself	OO
with	OO
poison	OO
for	OO
three	OO
years	,O
just	OO
so	OO
he	OO
can	OO
stay	OO
alive	OO
a	OO
little	OO
bit	OO
longer	OO
with	OO
you	,O
that	OO
stays	OO
with	OO
you	.O
when	OU
you	OO
watch	OO
him	OO
fade	OO
from	OO
the	OO
healthy	OO
person	OO
he	OO
was	OO
the	OO
night	OO
you	OO
met	OO
to	OO
nothing	,O
that	OO
stays	OO
with	OO
you	.O
when	OU
you	OO
watch	OO
your	OO
son	,O
who	OO
isn't	OO
even	OO
two	OO
years	OO
old	OO
yet	,O
walk	OO
up	OO
to	OO
his	OO
father's	OO
bed	OO
on	OO
the	OO
last	OO
day	OO
of	OO
his	OO
life	,O
like	OO
he	OO
knows	OO
what's	OO
coming	OO
in	OO
a	OO
few	OO
hours	,O
and	OO
say	,O
i	OU
love	OO
you	.O
all	OU
done	.O
bye	,U
bye	.O
that	OU
stays	OO
with	OO
you	.O
just	OU
like	OO
when	OO
you	OO
fall	OO
in	OO
love	,O
finally	,O
like	OO
really	OO
fall	OO
in	OO
love	OO
with	OO
someone	OO
who	OO
gets	OO
you	OO
and	OO
sees	OO
you	OO
and	OO
you	OO
even	OO
see	,O
oh	,U
my	OO
god	,U
i've	OU
been	OO
wrong	OO
this	OO
entire	OO
time	.O
love	OU
is	OO
not	OO
a	OO
contest	OO
or	OO
a	OO
reality	OO
show	OO
—	OO
it's	OO
so	OO
quiet	,O
it's	OO
this	OO
invisible	OO
thread	OO
of	OO
calm	OO
that	OO
connects	OO
the	OO
two	OO
of	OO
us	OO
even	OO
when	OO
everything	OO
is	OO
chaos	,O
when	OO
things	OO
are	OO
falling	OO
apart	,O
even	OO
when	OO
he's	OO
gone	.O
that	OU
stays	OO
with	OO
you	.O
we	OU
used	OO
to	OO
do	OO
this	OO
thing	OO
—	OO
because	OO
my	OO
hands	OO
are	OO
always	OO
freezing	OO
and	OO
he's	OO
so	OO
warm	,O
where	OO
i	OU
would	OO
take	OO
my	OO
ice	OO
cold	OO
hands	OO
and	OO
shove	OO
them	OO
up	OO
his	OO
shirt	.O
press	OO
them	OO
against	OO
his	OO
hot	OO
bod	.O
and	OU
he	OO
hated	OO
it	OO
so	OO
much	,O
but	OO
he	OO
loved	OO
me	,O
and	OO
after	OO
he	OO
died	,O
i	OU
laid	OO
in	OO
bed	OO
with	OO
aaron	OU
and	OO
i	OU
put	OO
my	OO
hands	OO
underneath	OO
him	OO
and	OO
i	OU
felt	OO
his	OO
warmth	.O
and	OU
i	OU
can't	OO
even	OO
tell	OO
you	OO
if	OO
my	OO
hands	OO
were	OO
cold	,O
but	OO
i	OU
can	OO
tell	OO
you	OO
that	OO
i	OU
knew	OO
it	OO
was	OO
the	OO
last	OO
time	OO
i	OU
would	OO
ever	OO
do	OO
that	.O
and	OU
that	OO
that	OO
memory	OO
is	OO
always	OO
going	OO
to	OO
be	OO
sad	.O
that	OU
memory	OO
will	OO
always	OO
hurt	.O
even	OU
when	OO
i'm	OU
600	OO
years	OO
old	OO
and	OO
i'm	OU
just	OO
a	OO
hologram	.O
just	OU
like	OO
the	OO
memory	OO
of	OO
meeting	OO
him	OO
is	OO
always	OO
going	OO
to	OO
make	OO
me	OO
laugh	.O
grief	OU
doesn't	OO
happen	OO
in	OO
this	OO
vacuum	,O
it	OO
happens	OO
alongside	OO
of	OO
and	OO
mixed	OO
in	OO
with	OO
all	OO
of	OO
these	OO
other	OO
emotions	.O
so	,U
i	OU
met	OO
matthew	,U
my	OO
current	OO
husband	OO
—	OO
who	OO
doesn't	OO
love	OO
that	OO
title	,O
but	OO
it's	OO
so	OO
accurate	.O
i	OU
met	OO
matthew	,U
and	.O
there	OO
was	OO
this	OO
audible	OO
sigh	OO
of	OO
relief	OO
among	OO
the	OO
people	OO
who	OO
love	OO
me	,O
like	,O
it's	OU
over	.O
she	OU
did	OO
it	.O
she	OU
got	OO
a	OO
happy	OO
ending	,O
we	OO
can	OO
all	OO
go	OO
home	.O
and	OU
we	OO
did	OO
good	.O
and	OU
that	OO
narrative	OO
is	OO
so	OO
appealing	OO
even	OO
to	OO
me	,O
and	OO
i	OU
thought	OO
maybe	OO
i	OU
had	OO
gotten	OO
that	,O
too	,O
but	OO
i	OU
didn't	.O
i	OU
got	OO
another	OO
chapter	.O
and	OU
it's	OO
such	OO
a	OO
good	OO
chapter	OO
—	OO
i	OU
love	OO
you	,O
honey	OO
—	OO
it's	OO
such	OO
a	OO
good	OO
chapter	.O
but	OU
especially	OO
at	OO
the	OO
beginning	,O
it	OO
was	OO
like	OO
an	OO
alternate	OO
universe	,O
or	OO
one	OO
of	OO
those	OO
old	OO
choose	OO
your	OO
own	OO
adventure	OO
books	OO
from	OO
the	OO
'80s	OO
where	OO
there	OO
are	OO
two	OO
parallel	OO
plot	OO
lines	.O
so	OU
i	OU
opened	OO
my	OO
heart	OO
to	OO
matthew	,U
and	OO
my	OO
brain	OO
was	OO
like	,O
would	OU
you	OO
like	OO
to	OO
think	OO
about	OO
aaron	?U
like	,U
the	OO
past	,O
the	OO
present	,O
future	,O
just	OO
get	OO
in	OO
there	,O
and	OO
i	OU
did	.O
and	OU
all	OO
of	OO
a	OO
sudden	,O
those	OO
two	OO
plots	OO
were	OO
unfurling	OO
at	OO
once	,O
and	OO
falling	OO
in	OO
love	OO
with	OO
matthew	OU
really	OO
helped	OO
me	OO
realize	OO
the	OO
enormity	OO
of	OO
what	OO
i	OU
lost	OO
when	OO
aaron	OU
died	.O
and	OU
just	OO
as	OO
importantly	,O
it	OO
helped	OO
me	OO
realize	OO
that	OO
my	OO
love	OO
for	OO
aaron	OU
and	OO
my	OO
grief	OO
for	OO
aaron	,U
and	OO
my	OO
love	OO
for	OO
matthew	,U
are	OO
not	OO
opposing	OO
forces	.O
they	OU
are	OO
just	OO
strands	OO
to	OO
the	OO
same	OO
thread	.O
they're	OU
the	OO
same	OO
stuff	.O
i'm	.U
what	OO
would	OO
my	OO
parents	OO
say	?O
i'm	OU
not	OO
special	.O
they	OU
had	OO
four	OO
kids	,O
they	OO
were	OO
like	.O
frankly	.O
but	OU
i'm	OU
not	,O
i'm	OU
not	OO
special	.O
i	OU
know	OO
that	,O
i'm	OU
fully	OO
aware	OO
that	OO
all	OO
day	,O
every	OO
day	,O
all	OO
around	OO
the	OO
world	,O
terrible	OO
things	OO
are	OO
happening	.O
all	OU
the	OO
time	.O
like	OU
i	OU
said	,O
fun	OO
person	.O
but	OU
terrible	OO
things	OO
are	OO
happening	,O
people	OO
are	OO
experiencing	OO
deeply	OO
formative	OO
and	OO

every	OO

and	OU
as	OO
part	OO
of	OO
my	OO

this	OO
weird	OO
podcast	OO
that	OO
i	OU

i	OU

we	OO

there	OO

that	OO

to	OO

your	OO

two	OO

how	OO

that	?O

i	OU
put	OO
a	OO

at	OO
the	OO
top	OO
of	OO
your	OO

so	OO
you	OO

up	?O
or	OU
do	OO
i	OU
put	OO
one	OO
at	OO
the	OO
bottom	OO
of	OO
your	OO

so	OO
it	OO
feels	OO

you're	OO

pushed	OO
up	?O
there	OU
were	OO
no	OO

there	OO

no	OO
commonly	OO

upon	OO
haptic	OO

to	OO

information	OO
with	.O
so	OU
my	OO
cofounders	OO
and	OO
i	OU
set	OO
out	OO
to	OO
create	OO
that	OO
language	.O
and	OU
the	OO
first	OO
device	OO
we	OO
built	OO
was	OO
not	OO
a	OO
kung	OO
fu	OO
suit	.O
but	OU
in	OO
a	OO
way	,O
it	OO
was	OO
even	OO
more	OO
impressive	OO
because	OO
of	OO
its	OO
simplicity	OO
and	OO
usefulness	.O
we	OU
started	OO
with	OO
the	OO
use	OO
case	OO
of	OO
navigation	,O
which	OO
is	OO
a	OO
simplified	OO
form	OO
of	OO
movement	.O
we	OU
then	OO
created	OO
wayband	,U
a	OO
wrist	OO
wearable	OO
device	OO
that	OO
could	OO
orient	OO
a	OO
user	OO
toward	OO
a	OO
destination	,O
using	OO
vibrating	OO
cues	.O
we	OU
would	OO
ask	OO
people	OO
to	OO
spin	OO
around	OO
and	OO
to	OO
stop	OO
in	OO
a	OO
way	OO
that	OO
they	OO
felt	OO
was	OO
the	OO
right	OO
way	OO
to	OO
go	.O
informally	,U
we	OO
tried	OO
this	OO
with	OO
hundreds	OO
of	OO
people	,O
and	OO
most	OO
could	OO
figure	OO
it	OO
out	OO
within	OO
about	OO
15	OO
seconds	.O
it	OU
was	OO
that	OO
intuitive	.O
initially	,U
we	OO
were	OO
just	OO
trying	OO
to	OO
get	OO
people	OO
out	OO
of	OO
their	OO
phones	OO
and	OO
back	OO
into	OO
the	OO
real	OO
world	.O
but	OU
the	OO
more	OO
we	OO
experimented	,O
the	OO
more	OO
we	OO
realized	OO
that	OO
those	OO
who	OO
stood	OO
to	OO
benefit	OO
most	OO
from	OO
our	OO
work	OO
were	OO
people	OO
who	OO
had	OO
little	OO
or	OO
no	OO
sight	.O
when	OU
we	OO
first	OO
approached	OO
a	OO
blind	OO
organization	,O
they	OO
told	OO
us	,O
don't	OU
build	OO
a	OO
blind	OO
device	.O
build	OU
a	OO
device	OO
that	OO
everyone	OO
can	OO
use	OO
but	OO
that's	OO
optimized	OO
for	OO
the	OO
blind	OO
experience	.O
we	OU
created	OO
our	OO
company	OO
wearworks	OU
with	OO
three	OO
guiding	OO
principles:	OO
make	OO
cool	OO
stuff	,O
create	OO
the	OO
greatest	OO
impact	OO
we	OO
can	OO
in	OO
our	OO
lifetimes	OO
and	OO
reimagine	OO
an	OO
entire	OO
world	OO
designed	OO
for	OO
touch	.O
and	OU
on	OO
november	OU
5	,O
2017	,O
wayband	OU
helped	OO
a	OO
person	OO
who	OO
was	OO
blind	OO
run	OO
the	OO
first	OO
15	OO
miles	OO
of	OO
the	OO
new	OU

city	OU
marathon	OU
without	OO
any	OO

assistance	.O
it	OU
didn't	OO
get	OO
him	OO
through	OO
the	OO
entire	OO
race	OO
due	OO
to	OO
the	OO
heavy	OO
rain	,O
but	OO
that	OO
didn't	OO
matter	.O
we	OU
had	OO
proved	OO
the	OO
point:	OO
that	OO
it	OO
was	OO
possible	OO
to	OO
navigate	OO
a	OO
complex	OO
route	OO
using	OO
only	OO
touch	.O
so	,U
why	OO
touch	?O
the	OU
skin	OO
has	OO
an	OO
innate	OO
sensitivity	OO
akin	OO
to	OO
the	OO
eyes'	OO
ability	OO
to	OO
recognize	OO
millions	OO
of	OO
colors	OO
or	OO
the	OO

ability	OO
to	OO
recognize	OO
complex	OO
pitch	OO
and	OO
tone	.O
yet	,U
as	OO
a	OO
communications	OO
channel	,O
it's	OO
been	OO
largely	OO
relegated	OO
to	OO
morse	OU
code	OO
like	OO

if	OU
you	OO
were	OO
to	OO
suddenly	OO
receive	OO
a	OO
kiss	OO
or	OO
a	OO
punch	,O
your	OO
reaction	OO
would	OO
be	OO
instinctive	OO

immediate	.O
meanwhile	,U
your	OO

would	OO
be	OO
playing	OO

up	OO
on	OO
the	OO

to	OO
understand	OO
the	OO

of	OO
what	OO
just	OO

and	OU

to	OO

pretty	OO
slow	.O
but	OU
it's	OO
a	OO
lightning	OO
bolt	OO
compared	OO
to	OO
the	OO
snail's	OO
pace	OO
of	OO
language	OO

i	OU
spent	OO
a	OO
considerable	OO
amount	OO
of	OO
time	OO
learning	OO
spanish	,U
japanese	,U

and	OO
currently	OO
swedish	,U
with	OO
varying	OO
degrees	OO
of	OO
failure	.O
but	OU
within	OO
those	OO
failures	OO
were	OO
kernels	OO
of	OO
how	OO
different	OO
languages	OO
are	OO
organized	.O
that	OU
gave	OO
our	OO
team	OO
insight	OO
into	OO
how	OO
to	OO
use	OO
the	OO
linguistic	OO
order	OO
of	OO
well	OO
established	OO
languages	OO
as	OO
inspiration	OO
for	OO
an	OO
entirely	OO
new	OO
haptic	OO
language	,O
one	OO
based	OO
purely	OO
on	OO
touch	.O
it	OU
also	OO
showed	OO
us	OO
when	OO
using	OO

wasn't	OO
the	OO
best	OO
way	OO
to	OO
deliver	OO
information	.O
in	OU
the	OO
same	OO
way	OO
a	OO
smile	OO
is	OO
a	OO
smile	OO
across	OO
every	OO
culture	,O
what	OO
if	OO
there	OO
was	OO
some	OO
underlying	OO
mechanism	OO
of	OO
touch	OO
that	OO
transcended	OO
linguistic	OO
and	OO
cultural	OO
boundaries	?O
a	OU
universal	OO
language	,O
of	OO
sorts	.O
you	OU
see	,O
i	OU
could	OO
give	OO
you	OO
buzz	OO
buzz	OO
buzz	,O
buzz	OO
buzz	,O
and	OO
you	OO
would	OO
eventually	OO
learn	OO
that	OO
that	OO
particular	OO
vibration	OO
means	OO
stop	.O
but	OU
as	OO
haptic	OO
designers	,O
we	OO
challenged	OO
ourselves	.O
what	OU
would	OO
it	OO
be	OO
like	OO
to	OO
design	OO
stop	?O
well	,U
based	OO
on	OO
context	,O
most	OO
of	OO
us	OO
have	OO
the	OO
experience	OO
of	OO
being	OO
in	OO
a	OO
vehicle	OO
and	OO
having	OO
that	OO
vehicle	OO
stop	OO
suddenly	,O
along	OO
with	OO
our	OO
body's	OO
reaction	OO
to	OO
it	.O
so	OU
if	OO
i	OU
wanted	OO
you	OO
to	OO
stop	,O
i	OU
could	OO
send	OO
you	OO
a	OO
vibration	OO
pattern	,O
sure	.O
or	,U
i	OU
could	OO
design	OO
a	OO
haptic	OO
experience	OO
that	OO
just	OO
made	OO
stopping	OO
feel	OO
like	OO
it	OO
was	OO
the	OO
right	OO
thing	OO
to	OO
do	.O
and	OU
that	OO
takes	OO
more	OO
than	OO
an	OO
arbitrary	OO
assignment	OO
of	OO
haptic	OO
cues	OO
to	OO
meanings	.O
it	OU
takes	OO
a	OO
deep	OO
empathy	.O
it	OU
also	OO
takes	OO
the	OO
ability	OO
to	OO
distill	OO
human	OO
experience	OO
into	OO
meaningful	OO
insights	OO
and	OO
then	OO
into	OO
haptic	OO
gestures	OO
and	OO
products	.O
haptic	OU
design	OO
is	OO
going	OO
to	OO
expand	OO
the	OO
human	OO
ability	OO
to	OO
sense	OO
and	OO
respond	OO
to	OO
our	OO
environments	,O
both	OO
physical	OO
and	OO
virtual	.O
there's	OU
a	OO
new	OO
frontier:	OO
touch	.O
and	OU
it	OO
has	OO
the	OO
power	OO
to	OO
change	OO
how	OO
we	OO
all	OO
see	OO
the	OO
world	OO
around	OO
us	.O
thank	OU
you	.O
have	OU
you	OO
ever	OO
tried	OO
to	OO
understand	OO
a	OO
teenager	?O
it's	OU
exhausting	,O
right	?O
you	OU
must	OO
be	OO
puzzled	OO
by	OO
the	OO
fact	OO
that	OO
some	OO
teens	OO
do	OO
well	OO
in	OO
school	,O
lead	OO
clubs	OO
and	OO
teams	OO
and	OO
volunteer	OO
in	OO
their	OO
communities	,O
but	OO
they	OO
eat	OO

pods	OU
for	OO
an	OO
online	OO
challenge	,O
speed	OO
and	OO
text	OO
while	OO
driving	,O
binge	OO
drink	OO
and	OO
experiment	OO
with	OO
illicit	OO
drugs	.O
how	OU
can	OO
so	OO
many	OO
teens	OO
be	OO
so	OO
smart	,O
skilled	OO
and	OO
responsible	OO
—	OO
and	OO
careless	OO
risk	OO
takers	OO
at	OO
the	OO
same	OO
time	?O
when	OU
i	OU
was	OO
16	,O
while	OO
frequently	OO
observing	OO
my	OO
peers	OO
in	OO
person	OO
as	OO
well	OO
as	OO
on	OO
social	OO
media	,O
i	OU
began	OO
to	OO
wonder	OO
why	OO
so	OO
many	OO
teens	OO
took	OO
such	OO
crazy	OO
risks	.O
it	OU
seems	OO
like	OO
getting	OO
a	OO
certificate	OO
from	OO
dare	OU
class	OO
in	OO
the	OO
fifth	OO
grade	OO
can't	OO
stop	OO
them	.O
what	OU
was	OO
even	OO
more	OO
alarming	OO
to	OO
me	OO
was	OO
that	OO
the	OO
more	OO
they	OO
exposed	OO
themselves	OO
to	OO
these	OO
harmful	OO
risks	,O
the	OO
easier	OO
it	OO
became	OO
for	OO
them	OO
to	OO
continue	OO
taking	OO
risks	.O
now	OU
this	OO
confused	OO
me	,O
but	OO
it	OO
also	OO
made	OO
me	OO
incredibly	OO
curious	.O
so	,U
as	OO
someone	OO
with	OO
a	OO
name	OO
that	OO
literally	OO
means	OO
to	OO
explore	OO
knowledge	,O
i	OU
started	OO
searching	OO
for	OO
a	OO
scientific	OO
explanation	.O
now	,U
it's	OO
no	OO
secret	OO
that	OO
teens	OO
ages	OO
13	OO
to	OO
18	OO
are	OO
more	OO
prone	OO
to	OO
risk	OO
taking	OO
than	OO
children	OO
or	OO
adults	,O
but	OO
what	OO
makes	OO
them	OO
so	OO
daring	?O
do	OU
they	OO
suddenly	OO
become	OO
reckless	,O
or	OO
is	OO
this	OO
just	OO
a	OO
natural	OO
phase	OO
that	OO
they're	OO
going	OO
through	?O
well	OU
neuroscientists	OO
have	OO
already	OO
found	OO
evidence	OO
that	OO
the	OO
teen	OO
brain	OO
is	OO
still	OO
in	OO
the	OO
process	OO
of	OO
maturation	OO
—	OO
and	OO
that	OO
this	OO
makes	OO
them	OO
exceptionally	OO
poor	OO
at	OO
decision	OO
making	,O
causing	OO
them	OO
to	OO
fall	OO
prey	OO
to	OO
risky	OO
behaviors	.O
but	OU
in	OO
that	OO
case	,O
if	OO
the	OO
maturing	OO
brain	OO
is	OO
to	OO
blame	,O
then	OO
why	OO
are	OO
teens	OO
more	OO
vulnerable	OO
than	OO
children	,O
even	OO
though	OO
their	OO
brains	OO
are	OO
more	OO
developed	OO
than	OO
those	OO
of	OO
children	?O
also	,U
not	OO
all	OO
teens	OO
in	OO
the	OO
world	OO
take	OO
risks	OO
at	OO
the	OO
same	OO
level	.O
are	OU
there	OO
some	OO
other	OO
underlying	OO
or	OO
unintentional	OO
causes	OO
driving	OO
them	OO
to	OO
risk	OO
taking	?O
well	,U
this	OO
is	OO
exactly	OO
what	OO
i	OU
decided	OO
to	OO
research	.O
so	,U
i	OU
founded	OO
my	OO
research	OO
on	OO
the	OO
basis	OO
of	OO
a	OO
psychological	OO
process	OO
known	OO
as	OO
habituation	,O
or	OO
simply	OO
what	OO
we	OO
refer	OO
to	OO
as	OO
getting	OO
used	OO
to	OO
it	.O
habituation	OU
explains	OO
how	OO
our	OO
brains	OO
adapt	OO
to	OO
some	OO
behaviors	,O
like	OO
lying	,O
with	OO
repeated	OO
exposures	.O
and	OU
this	OO
concept	OO
inspired	OO
me	OO
to	OO
design	OO
a	OO
project	OO
to	OO
determine	OO
if	OO
the	OO
same	OO
principle	OO
could	OO
be	OO
applied	OO
to	OO
the	OO
relentless	OO
rise	OO
of	OO
risk	OO
taking	OO
in	OO
teenagers	.O
so	OU
i	OU
predicted	OO
that	OO
habituation	OO
to	OO
risk	OO
taking	OO
may	OO
have	OO
the	OO
potential	OO
to	OO
change	OO
the	OO
already	OO
vulnerable	OO
teenage	OO
brain	OO
by	OO
blunting	OO
or	OO
even	OO
eradicating	OO
the	OO
negative	OO
emotions	OO
associated	OO
with	OO
risk	,O
like	OO
fear	OO
or	OO
guilt	.O
i	OU
also	OO
thought	OO
because	OO
they	OO
would	OO
feel	OO
less	OO
fearful	OO
and	OO
guilty	,O
this	OO
desensitization	OO
would	OO
lead	OO
them	OO
to	OO
even	OO
more	OO
risk	OO
taking	.O
in	OU
short	,O
i	OU
wanted	OO
to	OO
conduct	OO
a	OO
research	OO
study	OO
to	OO
answer	OO
one	OO
big	OO
question:	OO
why	OU
do	OO
teens	OO
keep	OO
making	OO
outrageous	OO
choices	OO
that	OO
are	OO
harmful	OO
to	OO
their	OO
health	OO
and	OO
well	OO
being	?O
but	OU
there	OO
was	OO
one	OO
big	OO
obstacle	OO
in	OO
my	OO
way	.O
to	OU
investigate	OO
this	OO
problem	,O
i	OU
needed	OO
teenagers	OO
to	OO
experiment	OO
on	,O
laboratories	OO
and	OO
devices	OO
to	OO
measure	OO
their	OO
brain	OO
activity	,O
and	OO
teachers	OO
or	OO
professors	OO
to	OO
supervise	OO
me	OO
and	OO
guide	OO
me	OO
along	OO
the	OO
way	.O
i	OU
needed	OO
resources	.O
but	,U
you	OO
see	,O
i	OU
attended	OO
a	OO
high	OO
school	OO
in	OO
south	OU
dakota	OU
with	OO
limited	OO
opportunity	OO
for	OO
scientific	OO
exploration	.O
my	OU
school	OO
had	OO
athletics	,O
band	,O

and	OO
other	OO

but	OO
there	OO
were	OO
no	OO

or	OO

and	OU
the	OO
notion	OO
of	OO
high	OO
schoolers	OO
doing	OO
research	OO
or	OO
participating	OO
in	OO
a	OO
science	OO
fair	OO
was	OO
completely	OO
foreign	.O

i	OU
didn't	OO

the	OO

to	OO
make	OO
a	OO

and	OU
these	OO
obstacles	OO
were	OO
frustrating	,O
but	OO
i	OU
was	OO
also	OO
a	OO
stubborn	OO
teenager	.O
and	OU
as	OO
the	OO

of	OO

just	OO
a	OO

my	OO

in	OO

i	OU
often	OO

i	OU

someone	OO

who	OO
was	OO
an	OO

in	OO
my	OO

i	OU
hoped	OO
that	OO
by	OO
doing	OO
this	OO

i	OU
could	OO
establish	OO
this	OO
and	OO
how	OO
valuable	OO
scientific	OO

could	OO
be	OO
for	OO
kids	OO
like	OO
me	OO
who	OO
didn't	OO
necessarily	OO
find	OO
their	OO
niche	OO
elsewhere	.O
so	OU
with	OO
limited	OO
research	OO
opportunities	,O
inventiveness	OO
allowed	OO
me	OO
to	OO
overcome	OO
seemingly	OO
impossible	OO
obstacles	.O
i	OU

more	OO
creative	OO
in	OO
working	OO
with	OO
a	OO

of	OO

i	OU

which	OO

i	OU

86	OO

using	OU
the	OO

i	OU
had	OO

the	OO

a	OU

they	OU
also	OO
rated	OO
their	OO
emotions	OO
on	OO

emotion	OO
measuring	OO
scales	.O
this	OU
meant	OO
that	OO
i	OU
had	OO
measured	OO
the	OO
process	OO
of	OO
habituation	OO
and	OO
its	OO
effects	OO
on	OO
decision	OO
making	.O
and	OU
it	OO
took	OO
29	OO
days	OO
to	OO
complete	OO
this	OO
research	.O
and	OU
with	OO
months	OO
of	OO
frantically	OO
drafting	OO
proposals	,O
meticulously	OO
computing	OO
data	OO
in	OO
a	OO
caffeinated	OO
daze	OO
at	OO
2am	,O
i	OU
was	OO
able	OO
to	OO
finalize	OO
my	OO
results	.O
and	OU
the	OO
results	OO
showed	OO
that	OO
habituation	OO
to	OO
risk	OO
taking	OO
could	OO
actually	OO
change	OO
a	OO
teen's	OO
brain	OO
by	OO
altering	OO
their	OO
emotional	OO
levels	,O
causing	OO
greater	OO
risk	OO
taking	.O
the	OU
students'	OO
emotions	OO
that	OO
were	OO
normally	OO
associated	OO
with	OO
risks	,O
like	OO
fear	,O
stress	,O
guilt	OO
and	OO
nervousness	,O
as	OO
well	OO
as	OO
attention	,O
were	OO
high	OO
when	OO
they	OO
were	OO
first	OO
exposed	OO
to	OO
the	OO
risk	OO
simulator	.O
this	OU
curbed	OO
their	OO
temptations	OO
and	OO
enforced	OO
self	OO
control	,O
which	OO
prevented	OO
them	OO
from	OO
taking	OO
more	OO
risks	.O
however	,U
the	OO
more	OO
they	OO
were	OO
exposed	OO
to	OO
the	OO
risks	OO
through	OO
the	OO
simulator	,O
the	OO
less	OO
fearful	,O
guilty	OO
and	OO
stressed	OO
they	OO
became	.O
this	OU
caused	OO
a	OO
situation	OO
in	OO
which	OO
they	OO
were	OO
no	OO
longer	OO
able	OO
to	OO
feel	OO
the	OO
brain's	OO
natural	OO
fear	OO
and	OO
caution	OO
instincts	.O
and	OU
also	,O
because	OO
they	OO
are	OO
teenagers	OO
and	OO
their	OO
brains	OO
are	OO
still	OO
underdeveloped	,O
they	OO
became	OO
more	OO
interested	OO
and	OO
excited	OO
in	OO
thrill	OO
seeking	OO
behaviors	.O
so	OU
what	OO
were	OO
the	OO
consequences	?O
they	OU
lacked	OO
self	OO
control	OO
for	OO
logical	OO
decision	OO
making	,O
took	OO
greater	OO
risks	OO
and	OO
made	OO
more	OO
harmful	OO
choices	.O
so	OU
the	OO
developing	OO
brain	OO
alone	OO
isn't	OO
to	OO
blame	.O
the	OU
process	OO
of	OO
habituation	OO
also	OO
plays	OO
a	OO
key	OO
role	OO
in	OO
risk	OO
taking	OO
and	OO
risk	OO
escalation	.O
although	OU
a	OO
teen's	OO
willingness	OO
to	OO
seek	OO
risk	OO
is	OO
largely	OO
a	OO
result	OO
of	OO
the	OO
structural	OO
and	OO
functional	OO
changes	OO
associated	OO
with	OO
their	OO
developing	OO
brains	,O
the	OO
dangerous	OO
part	OO
that	OO
my	OO
research	OO
was	OO
able	OO
to	OO
highlight	OO
was	OO
that	OO
a	OO
habituation	OO
to	OO
risks	OO
can	OO
actually	OO
physically	OO
change	OO
a	OO
teen's	OO
brain	OO
and	OO
cause	OO
greater	OO
risk	OO
taking	.O
so	OU
it's	OO
the	OO
combination	OO
of	OO
the	OO
immature	OO
teen	OO
brain	OO
and	OO
the	OO
impact	OO
of	OO
habituation	OO
that	OO
is	OO
like	OO
a	OO
perfect	OO
storm	OO
to	OO
create	OO
more	OO
damaging	OO
effects	.O
and	OU
this	OO
research	OO
can	OO
help	OO
parents	OO
and	OO
the	OO
general	OO
public	OO
understand	OO
that	OO
teens	OO
aren't	OO
just	OO
willfully	OO
ignoring	OO
warnings	OO
or	OO
simply	OO
defying	OO
parents	OO
by	OO
engaging	OO
in	OO
increasingly	OO
more	OO
dangerous	OO
behavior	.O
the	OU
biggest	OO
hurdle	OO
they're	OO
facing	OO
is	OO
their	OO
habituation	OO
to	OO
risks:	OO
all	OO
the	OO
physical	,O
detectable	OO
and	OO
emotional	OO
functional	OO
changes	OO
that	OO
drive	OO
and	OO
control	OO
and	OO
influence	OO
their	OO
over	OO
the	OO
top	OO
risk	OO
taking	.O
so	OU
yes	,O
we	OO
need	OO
policies	OO
that	OO
provide	OO
safer	OO
environments	OO
and	OO
limit	OO
exposures	OO
to	OO
high	OO
risks	,O
but	OO
we	OO
also	OO
need	OO
policies	OO
that	OO
reflect	OO
this	OO
insight	.O
these	OU
results	OO
are	OO
a	OO
wake	OO
up	OO
call	OO
for	OO
teens	,O
too	.O
it	OU
shows	OO
them	OO
that	OO
the	OO
natural	OO
and	OO
necessary	OO
fear	OO
and	OO
guilt	OO
that	OO
protect	OO
them	OO
from	OO
unsafe	OO
situations	OO
actually	OO
become	OO
numb	OO
when	OO
they	OO
repeatedly	OO
choose	OO
risky	OO
behaviors	.O
so	OU
with	OO
this	OO
hope	OO
to	OO
share	OO
my	OO
findings	OO
with	OO
fellow	OO
teenagers	OO
and	OO
scientists	,O
i	OU
took	OO
my	OO
research	OO
to	OO
the	OO

fair	,U
or	OO
isef	,U
a	OO

of	OO
over	OO
1,800	OO

needless	OU
to	OO

i	OU

this	OO

to	OO
me	,O
it	OO

a	OO
sort	OO
of	OO
inspiration	.O
it	OU
reminds	OO
me	OO
that	OO
this	OO

me	OO
to	OO
take	OO
risks	.O
and	OU
i	OU
know	OO
that	OO
might	OO
sound	OO
incredibly	OO
ironic	.O

i	OU
took	OO

that	OO

from	OO

not	OO
the	OO

the	OO

the	OO

true	?O

that	OO

on	OO

1992	,O
the	OO
day	OO
my	OO
mother	OO
followed	OO
her	OO

to	OO

my	OO

looked	OO
at	OO
my	OO

look	,U
habibti	,O
americans	OU

celebrating	OO
your	OO

unfortunately	,U
it	OO
didn't	OO
feel	OO
much	OO
like	OO
a	OO
celebration	OO
when	,O
growing	OO
up	,O
my	OO
mother	OO
and	OO
i	OU
would	OO
wander	OO
past	OO
queens	OU
into	OO

my	OO
mother	OO
with	OO
her	OO

and	OO
long	OO

would	OO
tighten	OO
her	OO
hand	OO
around	OO
my	OO

as	OO
she	OO
stood	OO
up	OO
against	OO

back	OO
to	OO
where	OO
you	OO
came	OO
from	,O

these	OU
words	OO
were	OO
meant	OO
to	OO
make	OO
us	OO
feel	OO
unsafe	,O
insecure	OO
in	OO
our	OO
own	OO
neighborhoods	,O
in	OO
our	OO
own	OO

but	OU
it	OO
was	OO
these	OO

streets	OO
that	OO
made	OO
me	OO
fall	OO
in	OO
love	OO
with	OO
new	OU
york	.U
queens	OU
is	OO
one	OO
of	OO
the	OO
most	OO

places	OO
in	OO
the	OO

with	OO

with	OO
something	OO
between	OO

15	OO

in	OO
a	OO

in	OO

and	OU
it	OO
was	OO
these	OO

that	OO
worked	OO
so	OO
hard	OO
to	OO
make	OO
sure	OO
that	OO
we	OO
had	OO
safe	OO
microcommunities	OO
—	OO
we	,O
as	OO

children	,O
to	OO
feel	OO
affirmed	OO

loved	OO
in	OO
our	OO

but	OU
it	OO
was	OO
mostly	OO
the	OO
women	.O
and	OU
these	OO
women	OO
are	OO
the	OO
reason	OO
why	,O
regardless	OO
of	OO
these	OO
statements	OO
that	OO
my	OO

faced	,O
she	OO
remained	OO
unapologetic	.O
and	OU
these	OO

some	OO
of	OO
the	OO
most	OO
powerful	OO
women	OO
i	OU
have	OO
ever	OO
met	OO
in	OO
my	OO
entire	OO
life	.O
i	OU

they	OO
had	OO

for	OO
everything	.O
they	OU
had	OO
rotations	OO
for	OO
who	OO
watched	OO
whose	OO
kids	OO
when	,O
for	OO
saving	OO

for	OO

parties	OO
and	OO
memorizing	OO
koran	OU
and	OO
learning	OO
english	.U
and	OU
they	OO
would	OO
collect	OO
small	OO
gold	OO
tokens	OO
to	OO

for	OO
the	OO
local	OO
mosque	.O
and	OU
it	OO
was	OO
these	OO
same	OO
women	,O
when	OO
i	OU
decided	OO
to	OO
wear	OO
my	OO
hijab	,O
who	OO
supported	OO
me	OO
through	OO
it	.O
and	OU
when	OO
i	OU
was	OO
bullied	OO
for	OO
being	OO
muslim	,U
i	OU
always	OO
felt	OO
like	OO
i	OU
had	OO
an	OO
army	OO
of	OO
unapologetic	OO
north	OU
african	OU
aunties	OO
who	OO
had	OO
my	OO
back	.O
and	OU
so	OO
every	OO
morning	OO
at	OO
15	,O
i	OU
would	OO
wake	OO
up	OO
and	OO
stand	OO
in	OO
front	OO
of	OO
a	OO
mirror	,O
and	OO
wrap	OO
beautiful	OO
bright	OO
silk	OO
around	OO
my	OO
head	OO
the	OO
way	OO
my	OO
mother	OO
does	OO
and	OO
my	OO
grandmother	OO
did	.O
and	OU
one	OO
day	OO
that	OO
summer	OO
2009	,O
i	OU
stepped	OO
out	OO
into	OO
the	OO
streets	OO
of	OO
new	OU
york	OU
city	OU
on	OO
my	OO
way	OO
to	OO
volunteer	OO
at	OO
a	OO
domestic	OO
violence	OO
organization	OO
that	OO
a	OO
woman	OO
in	OO
my	OO
neighborhood	OO
had	OO
started	.O
and	OU
i	OU
remember	OO
at	OO
that	OO
moment	OO
i	OU
felt	OO
a	OO
yank	OO
at	OO
the	OO
back	OO
of	OO
my	OO
head	.O
then	OU
someone	OO
pulled	OO
and	OO
grabbed	OO
me	,O
trying	OO
to	OO
remove	OO
my	OO
hijab	OO
from	OO
off	OO
of	OO
my	OO
head	.O
i	OU
turned	OO
around	OO
to	OO
a	OO
tall	,O
broad	OO
shouldered	OO
man	,O
pure	OO
hate	OO
in	OO
his	OO
eyes	.O
i	OU
struggled	OO
and	OO
fought	OO
back	,O
and	OO
finally	OO
was	OO
able	OO
to	OO
get	OO
away	,O
hid	OO
myself	OO
in	OO
the	OO
bathroom	OO
of	OO
that	OO
organization	OO
and	OO
cried	OO
and	OO
cried	.O
i	OU
kept	OO
thinking	OO
to	OO
myself	,O
why	OU
does	OO
he	OO
hate	OO
me	?O
he	OU
doesn't	OO
even	OO
know	OO
me	.O
hate	OU
crimes	OO
against	OO
muslims	OU
in	OO
the	OO
us	OU
increased	OO
by	OO
1,600	OO
percent	OO
post	OO
9/11	,O
and	OO
one	OO
in	OO
every	OO
four	OO
women	OO
in	OO
the	OO
us	OU
will	OO
suffer	OO
some	OO
form	OO
of	OO
gender	OO
violence	.O
and	OU
it	OO
may	OO
not	OO
seem	OO
like	OO
it	,O
but	OO
islamophobia	OU
and	OO
anti	OO
muslim	OU
violence	OO
is	OO
a	OO
form	OO
of	OO
gender	OO
violence	,O
given	OO
the	OO
visibility	OO
of	OO
muslim	OU
women	OO
in	OO
our	OO
hijabs	.O
and	OU
so	OO
i	OU
was	OO
not	OO
alone	,O
and	OO
that	OO
horrified	OO
me	.O
it	OU
made	OO
me	OO
want	OO
to	OO
do	OO
something	.O
it	OU
made	OO
me	OO
want	OO
to	OO
go	OO
out	OO
there	OO
and	OO
make	OO
sure	OO
that	OO
no	OO
one	OO
i	OU
loved	,O
that	OO
no	OO
woman	OO
would	OO
have	OO
to	OO
feel	OO
this	OO
insecure	OO
in	OO
her	OO
own	OO
skin	.O
so	OU
i	OU
started	OO
to	OO
think	OO
about	OO
how	OO
the	OO
women	OO
in	OO
my	OO
own	OO
neighborhood	OO
were	OO
able	OO
to	OO
build	OO
community	OO
for	OO
themselves	,O
and	OO
how	OO
they	OO
were	OO
able	OO
to	OO
use	OO
the	OO
very	OO
little	OO
resources	OO
they	OO
had	OO
to	OO
actually	OO
offer	OO
something	.O
and	OU
i	OU
began	OO
to	OO
think	OO
about	OO
what	OO
i	OU
could	OO
potentially	OO
offer	OO
to	OO
build	OO
safety	OO
and	OO
power	OO
for	OO
women	.O
and	OU
through	OO
this	OO
journey	,O
i	OU
learned	OO
a	OO
couple	OO
of	OO
things	,O
and	OO
this	OO
is	OO
what	OO
i	OU
want	OO
to	OO
share	OO
with	OO
you	OO
today	,O
some	OO
of	OO
these	OO
lessons	.O
so	OU
lesson	OO
number	OO
one:	OO
start	OO
with	OO
what	OO
you	OO
know	.O
at	OU
the	OO
time	,O
i	OU
had	OO
been	OO
doing	OO
shotokan	OU
karate	OO
for	OO
as	OO
long	OO
as	OO
i	OU
could	OO
remember	,O
and	OO
so	OO
i	OU
had	OO
a	OO
black	OO
belt	.O
yeah	.U
and	OU
so	,O
i	OU
thought	OO
—	OO
surprise	.O
i	OU
thought	OO
that	OO
maybe	OO
i	OU
should	OO
go	OO
out	OO
into	OO
my	OO
neighborhood	OO
and	OO
teach	OO
self	OO
defense	OO
to	OO
young	OO
girls	.O
and	OU
so	OO
i	OU
actually	OO
went	OO
out	OO
and	OO
knocked	OO
on	OO
doors	,O
spoke	OO
to	OO
community	OO
leaders	,O
to	OO
parents	,O
to	OO
young	OO
women	,O
and	OO
finally	OO
was	OO
able	OO
to	OO
secure	OO
a	OO
free	OO
community	OO
center	OO
basement	OO
and	OO
convince	OO
enough	OO
young	OO
women	OO
that	OO
they	OO
should	OO
come	OO
to	OO
my	OO
class	.O
and	OU
it	OO
actually	OO
all	OO
worked	OO
out	,O
because	OO
when	OO
i	OU
pitched	OO
the	OO
idea	,O
most	OO
of	OO
the	OO
responses	OO
were	,O
like	,O
all	OU
right	,O
cute	,O
this	OO
5'1	OO
hijabi	OO
girl	OO
who	OO
knows	OO
karate	.O
how	OU
nice	.O
but	OU
in	OO
reality	,O
i	OU
became	OO
the	OO
queens	,U
new	OU
york	OU
version	OO
of	OO
mr	.U
miyagi	OU
at	OO
16	OO
years	OO
old	,O
and	OO
i	OU
started	OO
teaching	OO
13	OO
young	OO
women	OO
in	OO
that	OO
community	OO
center	OO
basement	OO
self	OO
defense	.O
and	OU
with	OO
every	OO
single	OO
self	OO
defense	OO
move	,O
for	OO
eight	OO
sessions	OO
over	OO
the	OO
course	OO
of	OO
that	OO
summer	,O
we	OO
began	OO
to	OO
understand	OO
the	OO
power	OO
of	OO
our	OO
bodies	,O
and	OO
we	OO
began	OO
to	OO
share	OO
our	OO
experiences	OO
about	OO
our	OO
identities	.O
and	OU
sometimes	OO
there	OO
were	OO
shocking	OO
realizations	,O
and	OO
other	OO
times	OO
there	OO
were	OO
tears	,O
but	OO
mostly	OO
it	OO
was	OO
laughs	.O
and	OU
i	OU
ended	OO
that	OO
summer	OO
with	OO
this	OO
incredible	OO
sisterhood	,O
and	OO
i	OU
began	OO
to	OO
feel	OO
much	OO
safer	OO
in	OO
my	OO
own	OO
skin	.O
and	OU
it	OO
was	OO
because	OO
of	OO
these	OO
women	OO
that	OO
we	OO
just	OO
kept	OO
teaching	.O
i	OU
never	OO
thought	OO
that	OO
i	OU
would	OO
continue	,O
but	OO
we	OO
just	OO
kept	OO
teaching	.O
and	OU
today	,O
nine	OO
years	,O
17	OO
cities	,O
12	OO
countries	,O
760	OO
courses	OO
and	OO
thousands	OO
of	OO
women	OO
and	OO
girls	OO
later	,O
i'm	OU
still	OO
teaching	.O
and	OU
what	OO
started	OO
as	OO
a	OO
self	OO
defense	OO
course	OO
in	OO
the	OO
basement	OO
of	OO
a	OO
community	OO
center	OO
is	OO
now	OO
an	OO
international	OO
grassroots	OO
organization	OO
focused	OO
on	OO
building	OO
safety	OO
and	OO
power	OO
for	OO
women	OO
around	OO
the	OO
world:	OO
malikah	.U
now	,U
for	OO
lesson	OO
number	OO
two:	OO
start	OO
with	OO
who	OO
you	OO
know	.O
oftentimes	,U
it	OO
could	OO
be	OO
quite	OO
exciting	,O
especially	OO
if	OO
you're	OO
an	OO
expert	OO
in	OO
something	OO
and	OO
you	OO
want	OO
to	OO
have	OO
impact	,O
to	OO
swoop	OO
into	OO
a	OO
community	OO
and	OO
think	OO
you	OO
have	OO
the	OO
magic	OO
recipe	.O
but	OU
very	OO
early	OO
on	OO
i	OU
learned	OO
that	,O
as	OO
esteemed	OO
philosopher	OO
kendrick	OU
lamar	OU
once	OO
said	,O
it's	OO
really	OO
important	OO
to	OO
be	OO
humble	OO
and	OO
to	OO
sit	OO
down	.O
so	,U
basically	,O
at	OO
15	OO
years	OO
old	,O
the	OO
only	OO
community	OO
that	OO
i	OU
had	OO
any	OO
business	OO
doing	OO
work	OO
with	OO
were	OO
the	OO
14	OO
year	OO
old	OO
girls	OO
in	OO
my	OO
neighborhood	,O
and	OO
that's	OO
because	OO
i	OU
was	OO
friends	OO
with	OO
them	.O
other	OU
than	OO
that	,O
i	OU
didn't	OO
know	OO
what	OO
it	OO
meant	OO
to	OO
be	OO
a	OO
child	OO
of	OO
bengali	OU
immigrants	OO
in	OO
brooklyn	OU
or	OO
to	OO
be	OO
senegalese	OU
in	OO
the	OO
bronx	.U
but	OU
i	OU
did	OO
know	OO
young	OO
women	OO
who	OO
were	OO
connected	OO
to	OO
those	OO
communities	,O
and	OO
it	OO
was	OO
quite	OO
remarkable	OO
how	OO
they	OO
already	OO
had	OO
these	OO
layers	OO
of	OO
trust	OO
and	OO
awareness	OO
and	OO
relationship	OO
with	OO
their	OO
communities	.O
so	OU
like	OO
my	OO
mother	OO
and	OO
the	OO
women	OO
in	OO
her	OO
neighborhood	,O
they	OO
had	OO
these	OO
really	OO
strong	OO
social	OO
networks	,O
and	OO
it	OO
was	OO
about	OO
providing	OO
capacity	OO
and	OO
believing	OO
in	OO
other	OO
women's	OO
definition	OO
of	OO
safety	.O
even	OU
though	OO
i	OU
was	OO
a	OO
self	OO
defense	OO
instructor	,O
i	OU
couldn't	OO
come	OO
into	OO
a	OO
community	OO
and	OO
define	OO
safety	OO
for	OO
any	OO
other	OO
woman	OO
who	OO
was	OO
not	OO
part	OO
of	OO
my	OO
own	OO
community	.O
and	OU
it	OO
was	OO
because	,O
as	OO
our	OO
network	OO
expanded	,O
i	OU
learned	OO
that	OO
self	OO
defense	OO
is	OO
not	OO
just	OO
physical	.O
it's	OU
actually	OO
really	OO
emotional	OO
work	.O
i	OU
mean	,O
we	OO
would	OO
do	OO
a	OO
60	OO
minute	OO
self	OO
defense	OO
class	,O
and	OO
then	OO
we'd	OO
have	OO
30	OO
minutes	OO
reserved	OO
for	OO
just	OO
talking	OO
and	OO
healing	.O
and	OU
in	OO
those	OO
30	OO
minutes	,O
women	OO
would	OO
share	OO
what	OO
brought	OO
them	OO
to	OO
the	OO
class	OO
to	OO
begin	OO
with	OO
but	OO
also	OO
various	OO
other	OO
experiences	OO
with	OO
violence	.O
and	,U
as	OO
an	OO
example	,O
one	OO
time	OO
in	OO
one	OO
of	OO
those	OO
classes	,O
one	OO
woman	OO
actually	OO
started	OO
to	OO
talk	OO
about	OO
the	OO
fact	OO
that	OO
she	OO
had	OO
been	OO
in	OO
a	OO
domestic	OO
violence	OO
relationship	OO
for	OO
over	OO
30	OO
years	,O
and	OO
it	OO
was	OO
her	OO
first	OO
time	OO
being	OO
able	OO
to	OO
articulate	OO
that	OO
because	OO
we	OO
had	OO
established	OO
that	OO
safe	OO
space	OO
for	OO
her	.O
so	OU
it's	OO
powerful	OO
work	,O
but	OO
it	OO
only	OO
happens	OO
when	OO
we	OO
believe	OO
in	OO
women's	OO
agency	OO
to	OO
define	OO
what	OO
safety	OO
and	OO
what	OO
power	OO
looks	OO
like	OO
for	OO
themselves	.O
all	OU
right	,O
for	OO
lesson	OO
number	OO
three	OO
—	OO
and	OO
this	OO
was	OO
the	OO
hardest	OO
thing	OO
for	OO
me	OO
—	OO
the	OO
most	OO
important	OO
thing	OO
about	OO
this	OO
work	OO
is	OO
to	OO
start	OO
with	OO
the	OO
joy	.O
when	OU
i	OU
started	OO
doing	OO
this	OO
work	,O
i	OU
was	OO
reacting	OO
to	OO
a	OO
hate	OO
based	OO
attack	,O
so	OO
i	OU
was	OO
feeling	OO
insecure	OO
and	OO
anxious	OO
and	OO
overwhelmed	.O
i	OU
was	OO
really	OO
afraid	.O
and	OU
it	OO
makes	OO
sense	,O
because	OO
if	OO
you	OO
take	OO
a	OO
step	OO
back	,O
and	OO
i	OU
can	OO
imagine	OO
that	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
women	OO
in	OO
this	OO
room	OO
can	OO
probably	OO
relate	OO
to	OO
this	,O
the	OO
feeling	,O
an	OO
overwhelming	OO
feeling	OO
of	OO
insecurity	,O
is	OO
oftentimes	OO
with	OO
us	OO
constantly	.O
i	OU
mean	,O
imagine	OO
this:	OO
walking	OO
home	OO
late	OO
at	OO
night	,O
hearing	OO
footsteps	OO
behind	OO
you	.O
you	OU
wonder	OO
if	OO
you	OO
should	OO
walk	OO
faster	OO
or	OO
if	OO
you	OO
should	OO
slow	OO
down	.O
you	OU
keep	OO
your	OO
keys	OO
in	OO
your	OO
hand	OO
in	OO
case	OO
you	OO
need	OO
to	OO
use	OO
them	.O
you	OU
say	,O
text	OU
me	OO
when	OO
you	OO
get	OO
home	.O
i	OU
want	OO
to	OO
make	OO
sure	OO
you	OO
are	OO
safe	.O
and	OU
we	OO
mean	OO
those	OO
words	.O
we're	OU
afraid	OO
to	OO
put	OO

actually	OO
the	OO
love	OO
that	OO
i	OU
had	OO
for	OO

in	OO
my	OO

it	OU

the	OO

them	OO

their	OO
ability	OO
to	OO
build	OO

that	OO

me	OO
to	OO
keep	OO

this	OO

out	.O

whether	OO

they	OO

supported	OO
each	OO

in	OO

that	OO
shifted	OO

to	OO

and	OU
that	OO

how	OO
the	OO
change	OO
happens	.O
it	OU
was	OO
through	OO
those	OO
relationships	OO
we	OO
built	OO
together	.O
that's	OU
why	OO
we	OO
don't	OO
just	OO
teach	OO

we	OO
also	OO
throw	OO

write	OO

it's	OO
really	OO
about	OO
the	OO

it's	OO
been	OO

so	OO

so	OU
the	OO

i	OU

to	OO
leave	OO
you	OO

that	OO
the	OO
key	OO

for	OO
me	OO
in	OO

all	OO
of	OO

that	OO
i	OU

as	OO
the	OO

to	OO

i	OU
don't	OO

any	OO

for	OO
that	OO

the	OO

for	OO
the	OO

not	OO

the	OO

the	OO

that	OO

there	OU

arguments	OO

how	OO

thus	,U
some	OO
argue	OO
that	OO
the	OO
feeling	OO
you	OO
think	OO
you	OO
feel	OO
in	OO
your	OO
soul	OO
is	OO
just	OO
biology's	OO
way	OO

make	OO
you	OO
continue	OO
our	OO
species	.O
nature	OU
has	OO
selected	OO
you	OO
to	OO
have	OO
crushes	OO

just	OO

it	OO

monkeys	OO

on	OO
hot	OO
monkeys	,O
and	OO
biology	OO
marches	OO
on	.O
but	OU
is	OO
that	OO
all	OO
love	OO
is	?O
or	,U
perhaps	OO
worse	,O
is	OO
it	OO
just	OO
a	OO
construct	,O
some	OO
fake	OO
concept	OO
we	OO
all	OO
convince	OO
each	OO
other	OO
to	OO
try	OO
to	OO
live	OO
up	OO
to	OO
for	OO
a	OO
fake	OO
sense	OO
of	OO
purpose	?O
maybe	OU
it	OO
is	OO
a	OO
construct	,O
but	OO
let's	OO
be	OO
more	OO
precise	OO
about	OO
what	OO
a	OO
construct	OO
is	OO
because	OO
love	OO
is	OO
constructed	OO
from	OO
reality:	OO
our	OU
experiences	,O
feelings	,O
brain	OO
chemistry	,O
cultural	OO
expectations	,O
our	OO
lives	.O
and	OU
this	OO
edifice	OO
can	OO
be	OO
viewed	OO
through	OO
countless	OO
dimensions:	OO
scientific	,O
emotional	,O
historical	,O
spiritual	,O
legal	,O
or	OO
just	OO
personal	.O
if	OU
no	OO
two	OO
people	OO
are	OO
the	OO
same	,O
no	OO
two	OO
people's	OO
love	OO
is	OO
the	OO
same	OO
either	.O
so	,U
in	OO
every	OO
loving	OO
relationship	,O
there's	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
to	OO
talk	OO
about	OO
and	OO
partners	OO
should	OO
be	OO
open	OO
to	OO
that	,O
or	OO
the	OO
relationship	OO
probably	OO
won't	OO
last	.O
love	OU
is	OO
always	OO
up	OO
for	OO
discussion	OO
and	,O
sure	,O
under	OO
construction	.O
so	,U
if	OO
we	OO
can't	OO
define	OO
it	,O
that's	OO
a	OO
good	OO
sign	.O
it	OU
means	OO
we're	OO
all	OO

why	OU

some	OO

their	OO

how	OO

the	OU

about	OO
100,000	OO
to	OO
150,000	OO
hairs	OO
on	OO
our	OO
scalps	,O
and	OO
scientists	OO
have	OO
discovered	OO
two	OO
things	OO
about	OO
this	OO
dense	OO
thicket	.O
firstly	,U
the	OO
sprouting	OO
hair	OO
we	OO
see	OO
is	OO
mostly	OO
made	OO
up	OO
of	OO
keratin	,O
the	OO
protein	OO
leftover	OO
from	OO
dead	OO
cells	OO
that	OO
are	OO
forced	OO
upwards	OO
as	OO
new	OO
cells	OO
grow	OO
beneath	OO
them	.O
secondly	,U
the	OO
structures	OO
that	OO
drive	OO
hair	OO
growth	OO
are	OO
called	OO
hair	OO
follicles	,O
a	OO
network	OO
of	OO
complex	OO
organs	OO
that	OO
forms	OO
before	OO
we're	OO
born	,O
and	OO
grows	OO
hair	OO
in	OO
an	OO
everlasting	OO
cycle	.O
this	OU
cycle	OO
has	OO
three	OO
main	OO
phases	.O
the	OU
first	OO
is	OO
anagen	,O
the	OO
growth	OO
phase	,O
which	OO
up	OO
to	OO
90%	OO
of	OO
your	OO
hair	OO
follicles	OO
are	OO
experiencing	OO
right	OO
now	,O
causing	OO
them	OO
to	OO
push	OO
up	OO
hair	OO
at	OO
a	OO
rate	OO
of	OO
one	OO
centimeter	OO
per	OO
month	.O
anagen	OU
can	OO
last	OO
for	OO
two	OO
to	OO
seven	OO
years	,O
depending	OO
on	OO
your	OO
genes	.O
after	OU
this	OO
productive	OO
period	,O
signals	OO
within	OO
the	OO
skin	OO
instruct	OO
some	OO
follicles	OO
to	OO
enter	OO
a	OO
new	OO
phase	OO
known	OO
as	OO
catagen	,O
or	OO
the	OO
regressing	OO
stage	,O
causing	OO
hair	OO
follicles	OO
to	OO
shrink	OO
to	OO
a	OO
fraction	OO
of	OO
their	OO
original	OO
length	.O
catagen	OU
lasts	OO
for	OO
about	OO
two	OO
to	OO
three	OO
weeks	OO
and	OO
cuts	OO
blood	OO
supply	OO
to	OO
the	OO
follicle	,O
creating	OO
a	OO
club	OO
hair	,O
meaning	OO
it's	OO
ready	OO
to	OO
be	OO
shed	.O
finally	,U
hairs	OO
enter	OO
telogen	,O
the	OO
resting	OO
phase	,O
which	OO
lasts	OO
for	OO
ten	OO
to	OO
twelve	OO
weeks	,O
and	OO
affects	OO
about	OO
5	OO
15%	OO
of	OO
your	OO
scalp	OO
follicles	.O
during	OU
telogen	,O
up	OO
to	OO
200	OO
club	OO
hairs	OO
can	OO
be	OO
shed	OO
in	OO
a	OO
day	,O
which	OO
is	OO
quite	OO
normal	.O
then	,U
the	OO
growth	OO
cycle	OO
begins	OO
anew	.O
but	OU
not	OO
all	OO
heads	OO
are	OO
hairy	,O
and	,O
in	OO
fact	,O
some	OO
of	OO
them	OO
grow	OO
increasingly	OO
patchy	OO
over	OO
time	OO
in	OO
response	OO
to	OO
bodily	OO
changes	.O
95%	OO
of	OO
baldness	OO
in	OO
men	OO
can	OO
be	OO
attributed	OO
to	OO
male	OO
pattern	OO
baldness	.O
baldness	OU
is	OO
inherited	,O
and	OO
in	OO
people	OO
with	OO
this	OO
condition	,O
follicles	OO
become	OO
incredibly	OO
sensitive	OO
to	OO
the	OO
effects	OO
of	OO
dihydrotestosterone	,O
a	OO
hormonal	OO
product	OO
made	OO
from	OO
testosterone	.O
dht	OU
causes	OO
shrinkage	OO
in	OO
these	OO
overly	OO
sensitive	OO
follicles	,O
making	OO
hair	OO
shorter	OO
and	OO
wispier	.O
but	OU
loss	OO
isn't	OO
sudden	.O
it	OU
happens	OO
gradually	,O
along	OO
a	OO
metric	OO
known	OO
as	OO
the	OO
norwood	OU
scale	,U
which	OO
describes	OO
the	OO
severity	OO
of	OO
hair	OO

first	,U
hair	OO
recedes	OO
along	OO
the	OO
temples	,O
then	OO
hair	OO
on	OO
the	OO

to	OO
thin	OO
in	OO
a	OO
circular	OO
pattern	.O
at	OU
the	OO
highest	OO
rating	OO
on	OO
the	OO
scale	,O
these	OO
balding	OO
areas	OO
meet	OO
and	OO
expand	OO
dramatically	,O
eventually	OO
leaving	OO
only	OO
a	OO
ring	OO
of	OO

around	OO
the	OO

the	OO

genetics	OU

all	OO
that	OO

hair	OO
loss	.O
long	OU
periods	OO

release	OO

that	OO

them	OO
into	OO
the	OO

phase	OO
prematurely	.O
some	OU
women	OO

this	OO
after	OO

the	OO

the	OO

phase	.O
people	OU
going	OO

while	OO

the	OO
opposite	.O
below	OU

the	OO

that	OO

alive	.O
using	OU
this	OO
knowledge	,O
scientists	OO
have	OO
developed	OO

that	OO

combat	OO

by	OO
blocking	OO
the	OO

so	OO
that	OO

a	OO
role	OO

anyone	OO

anything	,O
the	OO

then	,O
why	OO

it	OO

when	OO

this	OU
must	OO
be	OO
some	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
optical	OO
illusion	.O
the	OU
question	OO
is	,O
which	OO
one	?O
one	OU
explanation	OO
is	OO
the	OO
ebbinghaus	OU
illusion	,U
where	OO
two	OO
identical	OO
objects	OO
look	OO
different	OO
because	OO
of	OO
the	OO

size	OO
of	OO
the	OO
objects	OO
they're	OO
surrounded	OO
by	.O
here	OU
the	OO
two	OO
center	OO

are	OO
actually	OO
the	OO

size	.O
maybe	OU
the	OO
moon	OO
looks	OO
bigger	OO
near	OO
the	OO
horizon	OO
because	OO
it's	OO
next	OO
to	OO
tiny	OO
trees	,O
houses	,O

towers	OO
in	OO
the	OO

but	OU
when	OO
the	OO
moon	OO
is	OO
higher	OO
up	,O
it's	OO
surrounded	OO
by	OO
the	OO
vast	OO
darkness	OO
of	OO
the	OO
night	OO
sky	OO
and	OO
looks	OO
tiny	OO
by	OO

another	OU
possibility	OO
is	OO
the	OO
famous	OO
ponzo	OU
illusion	.U
if	OU
you've	OO
ever	OO
tried	OO
to	OO
draw	OO
in	OO

you	OO

that	OO
the	OO
closer	OO
something	OO

to	OO
the	OO

the	OO
smaller	OO
you	OO
should	OO
draw	OO
it	.O
our	OU
brain	OO
compensates	OO
automatically	OO
for	OO
this	OO
by	OO
perceiving	OO
objects	OO
near	OO
the	OO

as	OO
larger	OO
than	OO
they	OO
actually	OO
appear	.O
the	OU
two	OO
yellow	OO
lines	OO
in	OO
this	OO
drawing	OO
are	OO
the	OO
same	OO
size	,O
but	OO
the	OO
upper	OO
one	OO
seems	OO
bigger	OO
because	OO
we	OO
interpret	OO
it	OO
as	OO
receding	OO
farther	OO
into	OO
the	OO

so	,U
between	OO
ponzo	OU
and	OO
ebbinghaus	,U
it	OO
seems	OO
like	OO
we've	OO
solved	OO
the	OO
mystery	OO
of	OO
the	OO
moon	OO

but	,O
unfortunately	,O
there	OO
are	OO
a	OO

that	OO
complicate	OO
things	.O
for	OU
one	OO
thing	,O
if	OO
this	OO

the	OO

then	OO
we	OO
would	OO
expect	OO
the	OO
moon	OO

to	OO
disappear	OO
for	OO
pilots	OO
flying	OO

any	OO

in	OO

the	OO

we'd	OO

it	OO

the	OU

your	OU

that	OO

it	OO

it	OO

in	OU

the	OO

this	OO

through	OO

how	OO

we	OU

to	OO

the	OU

this	OU

we	OO

we	OU

the	OO

to	OO

at	OO
an	OO
ever	OO

the	OU
leading	OO
idea	OO
for	OO

that	OO
it	OO

that	OU

the	OO

that	OO

as	OO
the	OO

dark	OU

on	OO
the	OO

hand	,O
don't	OO
expand	OO
with	OO
the	OO

because	OU
of	OO
this	OO

the	OO

by	OO

colder	OO

eventually	,U
the	OO

that	OU

so	OO
i	OU

a	OO

in	OO

something	OO

when	OU
you	OO

a	OO

you	OO
transform	OO
a	OO

is	OO
just	OO
a	OO

i	OU
grew	OO
up	OO
in	OO
rural	OO
kenya	OU
in	OO
a	OO
small	OO
village	OO
called	OO
enoosaen	.U
i	OU
was	OO
the	OO
first	OO
of	OO
eight	OO
children	,O

i	OU
spent	OO
my	OO

helping	OO
my	OO

farm	OO
and	OO
take	OO
care	OO
of	OO
my	OO

like	OU

i	OU
was	OO
engaged	OO
from	OO
a	OO
very	OO
young	OO

to	OO
be	OO

but	OU
as	OO
i	OU

the	OO
end	OO
of	OO
my	OO

and	,O
by	OO

my	OO

but	OU
i	OU
negotiated	OO
with	OO
my	OO
father	OO
in	OO
order	OO
to	OO
stay	OO
in	OO
school	OO
—	OO
even	OO
after	OO
going	OO
through	OO
fgm	.U
years	OU
later	OO
i	OU
went	OO
to	OO

and	OU
in	OO
order	OO
to	OO
get	OO
my	OO
community's	OO
support	,O
i	OU
promised	OO
to	OO
come	OO
back	OO
one	OO
day	OO
to	OO
repay	OO
that	OO
support	.O
but	OU
years	OO
later	,O
when	OO
i	OU
went	OO
back	OO
to	OO
my	OO
village	,O
not	OO
much	OO
had	OO
changed	.O
girls	OU
were	OO
still	OO
going	OO
through	OO
fgm	,U
still	OO
leaving	OO
school	,O
still	OO
getting	OO
married	OO
to	OO
men	OO
older	OO
than	OO
their	OO
fathers	OO
and	OO
still	OO
having	OO
children	OO
when	OO
they're	OO
teenagers	.O
i	OU
did	OO
not	OO
want	OO
to	OO
see	OO
any	OO
more	OO
girls	OO
go	OO
through	OO
that	.O
that's	OU
when	OO
i	OU
knew	OO
what	OO
i	OU
needed	OO
to	OO
do	OO
to	OO
give	OO
back	OO
to	OO
my	OO
community	.O
i	OU
built	OO
a	OO
school	OO
just	OO
for	OO
girls	OO
so	OO
that	OO
they	OO
can	OO
be	OO
free	OO
from	OO
fgm	OU
and	OO
early	OO
marriage	.O
at	OU
my	OO
first	OO
enrollment	OO
—	OO
at	OU
my	OO
first	OO
enrollment	,O
i	OU
had	OO
hoped	OO
for	OO
10	OO
girls	.O
100	OO
came	.O
i	OU
started	OO
to	OO
realize	OO
just	OO
how	OO
big	OO
this	OO
dream	OO
was	,O
and	OO
soon	OO
i	OU
learned	OO
that	OO
my	OO
school	OO
could	OO
be	OO
the	OO
foundation	OO
—	OO
but	OO
it	OO
wasn't	OO
going	OO
to	OO
be	OO
enough	.O
so	OU
that	OO
first	OO
year	,O
i	OU
enrolled	OO
these	OO
30	OO
girls	.O
some	OU
had	OO
been	OO
abused	,O
others	OO
were	OO
orphans	,O
and	OO
some	OO
came	OO
from	OO
families	OO
that	OO
are	OO
very	OO
traditional	,O
that	OO
had	OO
never	OO
sent	OO
any	OO
girl	OO
to	OO
school	.O
so	OU
school	OO
started	.O
though	OU
the	OO
girls	OO
seemed	OO
excited	OO
to	OO
be	OO
there	,O
they	OO
were	OO
having	OO
difficulty	OO
staying	OO
awake	.O
what	OU
was	OO
going	OO
on	?O
they	OU
had	OO
a	OO
teacher	,O
they	OO
had	OO
books	,O
there	OO
was	OO
a	OO
new	OO
classroom	OO
on	OO
the	OO
way	,O
but	.O
they	OU
were	OO
determined	OO
to	OO
be	OO
there	,O
but	OO
they	OO
had	OO
no	OO
energy	.O
then	OU
i	OU
realized	OO
they	OO
were	OO
hungry	,O
so	OO
i	OU
quickly	OO
found	OO
a	OO
cook	OO
and	OO
food	.O
soon	OU
thereafter	,O
i	OU
learned	OO
that	OO
a	OO
classroom	OO
was	OO
not	OO
enough	.O
i	OU
needed	OO
a	OO
boarding	OO
school	.O
not	OU
only	OO
were	OO
the	OO
girls	OO
tired	OO
and	OO
hungry	OO
from	OO
chores	OO
and	OO
long	OO
walks	OO
to	OO
school	OO
and	OO
back	OO
home	,O
they	OO
were	OO
also	OO
not	OO
safe	.O
it's	OU
a	OO
sad	OO
truth	,O
but	OO
girls	OO
are	OO
often	OO
assaulted	,O
raped	OO
and	OO
even	OO
kidnapped	OO
on	OO
their	OO
way	OO
to	OO
school	.O
so	OU
before	OO
a	OO
girl	OO
could	OO
learn	OO
math	OO
or	OO
history	,O
she	OO
needed	OO
to	OO
feel	OO
safe	,O
she	OO
needed	OO
to	OO
be	OO
rested	OO
and	OO
be	OO
well	OO
nourished	.O
so	OU
let	OO
me	OO
tell	OO
you	OO
about	OO
some	OO
of	OO
my	OO
girls	.O
this	OU
is	OO
faith	.U
faith	OU
comes	OO
from	OO
a	OO
very	OO
traditional	OO
family	OO
in	OO
the	OO
community	.O
her	OU
older	OO
sister	OO
had	OO
already	OO
gone	OO
through	OO
fgm	OU
and	OO
already	OO
married	,O
but	OO
faith	OU
was	OO
so	OO
determined	.O
she	OU
really	OO
loved	OO
learning	,O
and	OO
she	OO
wanted	OO
to	OO
come	OO
to	OO
my	OO
school	OO
when	OO
she	OO
heard	OO
about	OO
it	.O
so	OU
she	OO
asked	OO
her	OO
father	,O
her	OO
mother	OO
—	OO
anyone	OO
to	OO
bring	OO
her	OO
to	OO
my	OO
school	.O
they	OU
all	OO
refused	.O
faith	OU
did	OO
something	OO
very	OO
brave	.O
she	OU
stole	OO
an	OO
egg	OO
from	OO
her	OO
mother's	OO
house	,O
went	OO
to	OO
the	OO
market	,O
sold	OO
the	OO
egg	OO
and	OO
bought	OO
a	OO
single	OO
pencil	.O
then	OU
she	OO
walked	OO
five	OO
miles	,O
clenching	OO
that	OO
pencil	,O
trying	OO
to	OO
enroll	.O
she	OU
arrived	OO
—	OO
she	OU
arrived	OO
tired	OO
and	OO
hungry	,O
but	OO
determined	.O
i	OU
listened	OO
to	OO
her	OO
story	,O
and	OO
we	OO
enrolled	OO
her	OO
in	OO
my	OO
school	.O
but	OU
getting	OO
into	OO
my	OO
school	OO
was	OO
only	OO
just	OO
the	OO
start	.O
faith	OU
needed	OO
food	,O
she	OO
needed	OO
medicine	,O
she	OO
needed	OO
counseling	OO
—	OO
all	OO
of	OO
which	OO
we	OO
provided	.O
and	OU
she	OO
also	OO
met	OO
adults	OO
who	OO
already	OO
believed	OO
in	OO
her	.O
supported	OU
by	OO
this	OO
community	,O
faith	OU
was	OO
ready	OO
to	OO
learn	.O
this	OU
is	OO
faith	.U
six	OU
months	OO
of	OO
schooling	,O
now	OO
she's	OO
a	OO
happy	OO
sixth	OO
grader	OO
who	OO
dreams	OO
of	OO
becoming	OO
a	OO
pilot	OO
someday	,O
and	OO
her	OO
family	OO
now	OO
supports	OO
her	,O
and	OO
best	OO
of	OO
all	,O
her	OO
younger	OO
sisters	OO
will	OO
follow	OO
in	OO
her	OO
footsteps	.O
child	OU
marriage	OO
is	OO
expected	OO
to	OO
cost	OO
the	OO
global	OO
economy	OO
trillions	OO
of	OO
dollars	OO
over	OO
the	OO
next	OO
15	OO
years	.O
we	OU
can	OO
talk	OO
numbers	,O
but	OO
in	OO
a	OO
real	OO
lifetime	,O
what	OO
child	OO
marriage	OO
will	OO
cost	OO
my	OO
village	OO
is	OO
the	OO
doctor	,O
the	OO
teacher	,O
the	OO
entrepreneur	,O
the	OO
true	OO
partner	OO
our	OO
men	OO
will	OO
need	OO
in	OO
the	OO
future	.O
real	OO
ways	OO
women	OO
can	OO
help	OO
us	OO
lift	OO
out	OO
of	OO
poverty	.O
so	OU
i	OU
came	OO
to	OO
realize	OO
once	OO
again	,O
as	OO
i	OU
did	OO
when	OO
i	OU
needed	OO
help	OO
to	OO
go	OO
to	OO
university	,O
that	OO
while	OO
i	OU
could	OO
dream	OO
or	OO
have	OO
a	OO
dream	,O
i	OU
could	OO
not	OO
make	OO
it	OO
come	OO
true	OO
all	OO
by	OO
myself	.O
so	OU
i	OU
went	OO
back	OO
to	OO
the	OO
elders	OO
who	OO
helped	OO
me	OO
more	OO
than	OO
a	OO
decade	OO
ago	.O
i	OU
needed	OO
their	OO
support	OO
once	OO
again	OO
if	OO
i	OU
was	OO
going	OO
to	OO
be	OO
successful	.O
so	OU
i	OU
formed	OO
a	OO
community	OO
board	OO
with	OO
religious	OO
leaders	,O
parents	OO
and	OO
some	OO
teachers	OO
from	OO
other	OO
schools	.O
i	OU
needed	OO
allies	OO
in	OO
the	OO
government	OO
and	OO
in	OO
the	OO
community	OO
to	OO
help	OO
advance	OO
my	OO
goal	.O
i	OU
needed	OO
especially	OO
the	OO
support	OO
of	OO
the	OO
chief	OO
to	OO
help	OO
me	OO
enforce	OO
the	OO
no	OO
fgm	OU
policy	OO
in	OO
my	OO
school	.O
at	OU
first	OO
he	OO
was	OO
resistant	,O
but	OO
i	OU
persisted	OO
—	OO
and	OO
now	OO
he's	OO
our	OO
greatest	OO
ally	.O
i	OU
also	OO
needed	OO
the	OO
fathers	.O
that	OU
brings	OO
me	OO
to	OO
linet	.U
linet's	OU
father	,O
momposhi	,U
did	OO
not	OO
believe	OO
in	OO
the	OO
education	OO
of	OO
girls	.O
in	OU
fact	,O
he	OO
himself	OO
never	OO
went	OO
to	OO
school	.O
but	OU
linet's	OU
mother	OO
believed	OO
in	OO
linet	OU
and	OO
brought	OO
her	OO
to	OO
enroll	OO
in	OO
my	OO
school	,O
and	OO
i	OU
knew	OO
she	OO
belonged	OO
with	OO
us	.O
i	OU
just	OO
had	OO
to	OO
find	OO
a	OO
way	OO
to	OO
get	OO
momposhi	OU
to	OO
believe	OO
in	OO
linet	,U
too	.O
so	OU
i	OU
used	OO
the	OO
pretense	OO
of	OO
revealing	OO
linet's	OU
grade	OO
to	OO
get	OO
momposhi	OU
to	OO
come	.O
he	OU
came	,O
and	OO
he	OO
started	OO
noticing	OO
his	OO
daughter	OO
being	OO
promising	OO
as	OO
a	OO
student	.O
with	OU
each	OO
visit	,O
he	OO
built	OO
a	OO
strong	OO
relationship	OO
with	OO
his	OO
daughter	OO
—	OO
noticing	OO
not	OO
just	OO
her	OO
grades	OO
but	OO
also	OO
accepting	OO
her	OO
as	OO
someone	OO
with	OO
full	OO
potential	.O
so	OU
when	OO
linet	OU
was	OO
accepted	OO
in	OO
one	OO
of	OO
the	OO
top	OO
national	OO
high	OO
schools	OO
after	OO
eighth	OO
grade	,O
momposhi	OU
was	OO
bursting	OO
with	OO
pride	OO
and	OO
went	OO
around	OO
the	OO
village	OO
telling	OO
everyone	OO
how	OO
proud	OO
and	OO
how	OO
smart	OO
his	OO
daughter	OO
was	.O
can	OU
you	OO
imagine	?O
he	OU
brought	OO
linet	OU
to	OO
the	OO
new	OO
school	OO
himself	.O
it	OU
was	OO
the	OO
first	OO
time	OO
either	OO
of	OO
them	OO
had	OO
ever	OO
been	OO
to	OO
nairobi	.U
today	OU
linet	OU
is	OO
studying	OO
at	OO
university	OO
in	OO
australia	OU
—	OO
and	OO
momposhi	OU
is	OO
our	OO
greatest	OO
advocate	OO
in	OO
the	OO
community	.O
i	OU
also	OO
brought	OO
mothers	OO
to	OO
the	OO
table	,O
including	OO
my	OO
own	.O
that's	OU
my	OO
mother	OO
in	OO
one	OO
of	OO
our	OO

and	OU
our	OO
mothers	OO
are	OO
involved	OO
in	OO
the	OO
education	OO
of	OO
their	OO

children	.O
i	OU
also	OO
brought	OO
grandmothers	OO
into	OO
the	OO

in	OU
my	OO
community	,O
grandmothers	OO
are	OO
the	OO
proud	OO
keepers	OO
of	OO
our	OO
stories	OO
and	OO
cultures	,O
and	OO
i	OU
wanted	OO
my	OO

to	OO

embrace	OO
our	OO
rich	OO
maasai	OU
culture	.O
today	,U
grandmothers	OO
do	OO

with	OO
the	OO

and	OO
it's	OO
a	OO
beautiful	OO
way	OO
our	OO
community	OO
remains	OO
connected	.O
i	OU
also	.O
started	OO
working	OO
with	OO
the	OO
boys	.O
what	OU
would	OO
happen	OO
if	OO
the	OO
boys	OO
grew	OO
up	OO
with	OO
the	OO
same	OO
mindset	OO
as	OO
their	OO
fathers	OO
before	OO
them	?O
i'll	OU
tell	OO
you	,O
not	OO
much	OO
will	OO
change	.O
so	OU
i	OU
enlisted	OO
support	OO
from	OO
an	OO
organization	OO
called	OO
i'm	OU
worth	OU
defending:	OU
a	OO
group	OO
of	OO
young	,O
progressive	OO
leaders	OO
led	OO
by	OO
alfred	OU
and	OO
george	.U
together	OU
we	OO
created	OO
a	OO
training	OO
program	OO
for	OO
boys	OO
and	OO
girls	OO
who	OO
could	OO
not	OO
attend	OO
my	OO
school	,O
sharing	OO
vital	OO
information	OO
about	OO
gender	OO
equality	,O
health	OO
and	OO
human	OO
rights	.O
today	OU
we	OO
have	OO
reached	OO
over	OO
10,000	OO
boys	OO
and	OO
girls	OO
and	OO
counting	.O
it	OU
turns	OO
out	OO
it	OO
truly	OO
does	OO
take	OO
a	OO
village	OO
to	OO
make	OO
this	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
a	OO
dream	OO
come	OO
true	.O
that's	OU
what	OO
you're	OO
seeing	OO
today	,O
where	OO
nearly	OO
400	OO
girls	OO
have	OO
not	OO
gone	OO
through	OO
fgm	OU
in	OO
my	OO

in	OO
a	OO
region	OO
where	OO
nearly	OO
80	OO

believe	OU
me	,O
these	OO

they	OO
are	OO
sharing	OO
their	OO

with	OO
their	OO

they're	OU

it's	OO

what	OO

rich	?O
that's	OU
the	OO
question	OO
i	OU
asked	OO
my	OO
professor	OO
when	OO
i	OU
studied	OO
sociology	OO
in	OO
the	OO
early	OO
90s	OO
because	OO
he	OO
was	OO
having	OO
a	OO
lecture	OO
about	OO
social	OO
democracies	,O
the	OO
scandinavian	OU
welfare	OO
state	,O
and	OO
he	OO
was	OO
a	OO
classical	OO
left	OO
wing	OO
sociology	OO
professor	,O
and	OO
he	OO
could	OO
not	OO
hide	OO
his	OO
enthusiasm	OO
when	OO
he	OO
talked	OO
about	OO
these	OO
egalitarian	OO
societies	OO
with	OO
no	OO
rich	OO
people	OO
and	OO
no	OO
poor	OO
people	.O
but	OU
i	,U
on	OO
the	OO
other	OO
hand	,O
i	OU
was	OO
writing	OO
my	OO
master's	OO
thesis	OO
about	OO
rich	OO
people	.O
when	OU
i	OU
interviewed	OO
my	OO
informants	OO
from	OO
the	OO
upper	OO
classes	,O
they	OO
all	OO
said	OO
the	OO
same	OO
thing:	OO
life	OU
in	OO
scandinavia	OU
is	OO
tough	.O
we	OU
have	OO
to	OO
work	OO
twice	OO
as	OO
hard	OO
to	OO
earn	OO
money	OO
because	OO
we	OO
have	OO
to	OO
struggle	OO
against:	OO
high	OO
taxes	,O
strong	OO
unions	OO
controlling	OO
the	OO
wages	OO
and	OO
a	OO
generous	OO
welfare	OO
state	OO
that	OO
makes	OO
people	OO
lazy	.O
as	OU
one	OO
rich	OO
guy	OO
told	OO
me	,O
he	OO
said	,O
they	OU
call	OO
it	OO
a	OO
social	OO
security	OO
net	.O
well	,U
i	OU
call	OO
it	OO
a	OO
hammock	.O
and	OU
as	OO
every	OO
aspiring	OO
social	OO
scientist	,O
i	OU
started	OO
to	OO
go	OO
native;	OO
i	OU
started	OO
to	OO
feel	OO
sympathy	OO
for	OO
these	OO
rich	OO
people	.O
and	OU
that's	OO
why	OO
i	OU
raised	OO
my	OO
hand	OO
and	OO
asked	OO
my	OO
professor	,O
well	,U
what	OO
if	OO
you	OO
don't	OO
care	OO
so	OO
much	OO
about	OO
equality	?O
what	OU
if	OO
your	OO
dream	OO
is	OO
to	OO
become	OO
rich	?O
where	OU
in	OO
the	OO
world	OO
should	OO
i	OU
have	OO
been	OO
born	OO
to	OO
become	OO
really	OO
rich	?O
i	OU
still	OO
remember	OO
the	OO
puzzled	OO
look	OO
on	OO
my	OO
professor's	OO
face	.O
but	OU
he	OO
answered	OO
the	OO
best	OO
he	OO
could	.O
something	OU
like	,O
well	,U
if	OO
that's	OO
your	OO
goal	OO
in	OO
life	,O
you	OO
should	OO
probably	OO
have	OO
been	OO
born	OO
in	OO
a	OO
society	OO
with	OO
free	OO
markets	,O
low	OO
taxes	,O
and	OO
minimal	OO
government	OO
intervention	.O
and	OU
he	OO
added	,O
if	OU
you	OO
want	OO
to	OO
become	OO
rich	,O
you	OO
should	OO
probably	OO
not	OO
study	OO
sociology	.O
that	OU
was	OO
a	OO
good	OO
answer	OO
and	OO
the	OO
best	OO
guess	OO
we	OO
had	OO
back	OO
then	.O
that	OU
is	OO
until	OO
i	OU
saw	OO
that	OO
the	OO
university	OU
of	OO
oslo	OU
professor	OO
in	OO
economy	,U
karl	OU
moene	,U
actually	OO
had	OO
checked	OO
the	OO
facts:	OO
where	OU
in	OO
the	OO
world	OO
is	OO
it	OO
easiest	OO
to	OO
get	OO
rich	?O
and	OU
before	OO
i	OU
share	OO
with	OO
you	OO
where	OO
you	OO
should	OO
go	OO
to	OO
earn	OO
money	,O
we	OO
have	OO
to	OO
define	OO
rich	.O
the	OU
un	OU
talks	OO
about	OO
the	OO
poverty	OO
line	.O
you	OU
know	,O
if	OO
you	OO
earn	OO
less	OO
than	OO
one	OO
dollar	OO
a	OO
day	,O
maybe	OO
two	OO
dollars	OO
a	OO
day	.O
but	OU
we	OO
have	OO
to	OO
define	OO
the	OO
richness	OO
line	.O
it's	OU
a	OO
more	OO
fun	OO
line	,O
actually	.O
and	OU
the	OO
most	OO
reliable	OO
report	,O
when	OO
it	OO
comes	OO
to	OO
rich	OO
people	,O
the	OO
wealth	OU

they	OO
set	OO
the	OO
richness	OO
line	OO
at	OO
individuals	OO
with	OO
net	OO
worth	OO
more	OO
than	OO
30	OO
million	OO
usd	.U
in	OU
the	OO
consultant	OO
jargon	,O
these	OO
people	OO
are	OO
called	OO
uhnwi's	.U
that	OU
is	OO
ultra	OU
high	OU
net	OU
worth	OU
individuals	.U
that	OU
guy	,O
by	OO
the	OO
way	,O
is	OO
not	OO
rich	.O
he	OU
is	OO
just	OO
a	OO
model	.O
actually	,U
on	OO
the	OO
lower	OO
part	OO
of	OO
the	OO

and	OU
i	OU
have	OO
saved	OO
some	OO
money	OO
by	OO
keeping	OO
the	OO

there	OO
as	OO
well	.O
smart	.U
so	,U
according	OO
to	OO
the	OU

there	OO
are	OO
more	OO
than	OO
170	,O

uhnwi's	OU
in	OO
the	OO
world	.O
and	OU
here	OO
is	OO
the	OO
top	OO
five	OO
list	OO
of	OO
countries	OO
with	OO
the	OO
richest	OO

number	OU
five:	OO

of	OO

the	OO

but	OU
of	OO

we	OO
are	OO
not	OO
interested	OO
in	OO
the	OO

here	.O
we	OU
are	OO
interested	OO
in	OO
rich	OO
people	OO
per	OO

and	OU
if	OO
we	OO
leave	OO
out	OO
the	OO
pure	OO

like	OO
cyprus	,U
and	OO
switzerland	,U

where	OO
we	OO
have	OO
an	OO
artificially	OO
huge	OO

it	OO
turns	OO
out	OO
that	OO
we	OO
have	OO
on	OO

with	OO
179	OO
rich	OO
people	OO
per	OO
one	OO

canada	,U
new	OU

sweden	OU
and	OO
on	OO
top:	OO
norway	.U
but	OU
where's	OO
the	OO
us	?U
on	OU
place	OO
13	.O
so	OU
what	OO
happened	OO
to	OO
my	OO
old	OO
professor's	,O
you	OO
know	,O
social	OO
democracies	?O
there	OU
are	OO
no	OO
rich	OO
people	OO
there	.O
but	OU
ok	.U
30	OO
million	OO
dollars	,O
that's	OO
just	OO
pocket	OO
money	OO
in	OO
a	OO
country	OO
like	OO
the	OO
us	,U
where	OO
people	OO
can	OO
get	OO
insanely	OO
rich	.O
look	OU
at	OO
the	OO

again	?O
so	,U
let's	OO
raise	OO
the	OO
richness	OO
line	OO
up	OO
from	OO
30	OO
million	OO
dollars	OO
up	OO
to	.O
1	OO

and	OU
the	OO
most	OO
reliable	OO

here	OO
is	OO
the	OO

and	OU
according	OO

if	OO
you	OO

iceland	OU
with	OO

with	OU
a	OO
single	OO
billionaire:	OO
thor	OU
björgólfsson	.U
he	OU
could	OO
have	OO
been	OO
a	OO
model	.O
but	OU
the	OO
point	OO
is	,O
the	OO
united	OU
states:	OU
1.7	OO
scandinavia	OU
taken	OO
as	OO
a	OO
whole:	OO
2.1	OO
and	OU
the	OO
big	OO
mystery	OO
is	.O
how	OU
can	OO
this	OO
be	?O
how	OU
can	OO
bernie	OU
sanders'	OU
dream	OO
societies	,O
these	OO
socialist	OO
paradises	OO
be	OO
such	OO
a	OO
breeding	OO
place	OO
for	OO
rich	OO
people	?O
that's	OU
a	OO
mystery	.O
there	OU
are	OO
two	OO
reasons	.O
reason	OU
number	OO
one	OO
is	OO
free	OO
education	.O
social	OU
democracies	OO
give	OO
free	OO
higher	OO
education	OO
to	OO
everybody	,O
and	OO
cheap	OO
student	OO
loans	,O
and	OO
grants	.O
that	OU
enables	OO
more	OO
people	OO
to	OO
use	OO
their	OO
talents	OO
and	OO
earn	OO
money	.O
we	OU
can	OO
see	OO
this	OO
in	OO
the	OO
social	OO
mobility	OO
numbers	.O
imagine	OU
all	OO
fathers	OO
in	OO
a	OO
society	,O
and	OO
we	OO
divide	OO
them	OO
into	OO
five	OO
groups	OO
based	OO
on	OO
income:	OO
from	OO
the	OO
bottom	OO
fifth	OO
up	OO
to	OO
the	OO
top	OO
fifth	.O
then	OU
we	OO
look	OO
at	OO
their	OO
sons	,O
and	OO
divide	OO
their	OO
income	OO
into	OO
five	OO
steps	,O
and	OO
we	OO
see	OO
how	OO
many	OO
sons	OO
of	OO
the	OO
fathers	OO
from	OO
the	OO
bottom	OO
income	OO
end	OO
up	OO
on	OO
top	.O
how	OU
many	OO
sons	OO
go	OO
from	OO
rags	OO
to	OO
riches	?O
if	OU
it	OO
was	OO
perfect	OO
social	OO
mobility	,O
if	OO
talents	OO
and	OO
opportunities	OO
were	OO
equally	OO
distributed	,O
20%	OO
from	OO
the	OO
bottom	OO
would	OO
end	OO
up	OO
on	OO
each	OO
of	OO
these	OO
five	OO
ladders	.O
so	OU
let's	OO
look	OO
at	OO
the	OO
numbers	OO
for	OO
the	OO
different	OO
countries	.O
in	OU
denmark	,U
they	OO
are	OO
pretty	OO
close	OO
to	OO
perfect	OO
social	OO
mobility	OO
with	OO
14%	OO
that	OO
goes	OO
from	OO
rags	OO
to	OO
riches	.O
in	OU
norway	OU
12	,O
sweden	OU
11	,O
the	OO
united	OU
states	OU
8	.O
because	OU
of	OO
free	OO
education	,O
there	OO
are	OO
more	OO
self	OO
made	OO
men	OO
in	OO
scandinavia	OU
than	OO
in	OO
the	OO
us	.U
and	OU
if	OO
we	OO
look	OO
at	OO
those	OO
sons	OO
who	OO
don't	OO
end	OO
up	OO
on	OO
top	OO
but	OO
stay	OO
at	OO
the	OO
bottom	,O
that	OO
go	OO
from	OO
rags	OO
to	OO
rags	.O
again	,U
20%	OO
would	OO
be	OO
perfect	OO
mobility	.O
in	OU
denmark	,U
25%	OO
ends	OO
up	OO
at	OO
the	OO
bottom	,O
sweden	OU
a	OO
bit	OO
more	.O
norway	.U
and	OU
look	OO
at	OO
the	OO
united	OU
states	.U
this	OU
is	OO
because	OO
education	OO
in	OO
the	OO
united	OU
states	OU
is	OO
very	OO
expensive	.O
but	OU
the	OO
second	OO
and	OO
most	OO
important	OO
explanation	OO
for	OO
scandinavia	OU
being	OO
such	OO
a	OO
breeding	OO
place	OO
for	OO
rich	OO
people	OO
is	OO
this:	OO
have	OU
you	OO
ever	OO
noticed	OO
if	OO
you	OO
have	OO
been	OO
to	OO
the	OO
united	OU
states	,U
when	OO
you	OO
drive	OO
around	OO
and	OO
drive	OO
through	OO
a	OO
toll	OO
plaza	,O
there	OO
are	OO
actually	OO
people	OO
sitting	OO
there	OO
taking	OO
your	OO
money	.O
compare	OU
that	OO
to	OO
my	OO
local	OO
toll	OO
plaza	.O
just	OU
a	OO
sign	OO
with	OO
some	OO
gizmo	OO
attached	OO
to	OO
it	.O
and	OU
when	OO
you	OO
go	OO
to	OO
a	OO
supermarket	OO
in	OO
the	OO
united	OU
states	,U
there	OO
are	OO
actually	OO
people	OO
there	OO
helping	OO
to	OO
pack	OO
your	OO
things	OO
into	OO
your	OO
bags	.O
it's	OU
very	OO
friendly	OO
and	OO
convenient	OO
compared	OO
to	OO
my	OO
local	OO
grocery	OO
store	.O
like	OU
this	.O
there's	OU
nobody	OO
there	.O
the	OU
biggest	OO
shock	OO
i	OU
had	OO
when	OO
i	OU
went	OO
to	OO
the	OO
us	OU
for	OO
the	OO
first	OO
time	,O
when	OO
i	OU
went	OO
to	OO
the	OO
restroom	,O
there	OO
were	OO
actually	OO
people	OO
working	OO
there	.O
compare	OU
that	OO
to	OO
my	OO
local	OO
public	OO
toilet	.O
there's	OU
not	OO
even	OO
a	OO
cleaner	OO
there;	OO
it	OO
cleans	OO
itself	OO
automatically	.O
and	OU
the	OO
reason	OO
for	OO
this	OO
difference	OO
is	OO
that	OO
scandinavian	OU
unions	OO
are	OO
pressing	OO
up	OO
the	OO
minimum	OO
wages	.O
it's	OU
so	OO
expensive	OO
to	OO
have	OO
these	OO
people	OO
working	OO
there	.O
in	OU
norway	,U
tollbooth	OO
operators	,O
supermarket	OO
packers	,O
and	OO
a	OO
restroom	OO
janitor	OO
would	OO
earn	OO
almost	OO
three	OO
times	OO
as	OO
much	OO
as	OO
in	OO
the	OO
us	.U
and	OU
that's	OO
why	OO
we	OO
have	OO
replaced	OO
these	OO
people	OO
with	OO
machines	.O
that	OU
is	OO
why	OO
i	OU
was	OO
surprised	OO
when	OO
i	OU
saw	OO
this	OO
article	OO
in	OO
the	OU
new	OU

times	OU
in	OO
2014	.O
preparing	OU
for	OO
chip	OU
and	OO
pin	OU
cards	OU
in	OO
the	OO
united	OU
states	.U
because	OU
in	OO
the	OO
united	OU
states	OU
people	OO
are	OO
still	OO
using	OO
paper	OO
checks	OO
as	OO
a	OO
method	OO
of	OO
payment	,O
while	OO
scandinavian	OU
banks	OO
have	OO
made	OO
us	OO
start	OO
using	OO
chip	OU
and	OO
pin	OU
cards	OO
long	OO
ago	.O
because	OU
the	OO
minimum	OO
wages	OO
here	OO
are	OO
so	OO
high	.O
so	OU
scandinavian	OU
banks	OO
can't	OO
afford	OO
having	OO
people	OO
manually	OO
control	OO
the	OO
checks	.O
so	OU
scandinavian	OU
companies	,O
because	OO
of	OO
the	OO

pressing	OO
up	OO
the	OO
wages	,O
they	OO
have	OO
to	OO

they	OO

of	OO
solidarity	,O
scandinavian	OU
unions	OO
hold	OO
back	OO
the	OO
highest	OO
salaries	OO
of	OO
the	OO
skilled	OO
workers	.O
so	OU
for	OO
example	,O
a	OO
norwegian	OU
senior	OO
engineer	OO
it's	OO
my	OO
uncle	,O
by	OO
the	OO
way	.O
that's	OU
why	OO
there's	OO
no	OO
watermark	OO
there	.O
actually	,U
he	OO
would	OO
look	OO
cooler	OO
with	OO
a	OO
watermark	,O
better	.O
he	OU
earns	,O
on	OO
average	OO
per	OO
year	,O
76,000	OO
dollars	,O
while	OO
his	OO
american	OU
colleague	OO
earns	OO
more	OO
than	OO
100,000	OO
dollars	.O
so	OU
american	OU
engineers	.O
they	OU
are	OO
not	OO
only	OO
more	OO
good	OO
looking	,O
but	OO
they	OO
are	OO
more	OO
expensive	.O
of	OU
course	,O
this	OO
wage	OO
restraint	OO
on	OO
high	OO
skilled	OO
work	OO
is	OO
good	OO
for	OO
profit	.O
so	,U
the	OO
unions	OO
are	OO
in	OO
effect	OO
subsidizing	OO
the	OO
capitalists	.O
i	OU
wish	OO
i	OU
knew	OO
all	OO
this	OO
when	OO
i	OU
gave	OO
up	OO
a	OO
career	OO
in	OO
social	OO
science	OO
because	OO
the	OO
beauty	OO
and	OO
the	OO
irony	OO
of	OO
these	OO
findings	,O
i	OU
think	,O
is	OO
amazing	.O
on	OU
the	OO
one	OO
hand	,O
you	OO
have	OO
my	OO
rich	OO
informants	OO
that	OO
complain	OO
about	OO
how	OO
hard	OO
it	OO
is	OO
to	OO
get	OO
rich	OO
in	OO
scandinavia	.U
they	OU
had	OO
it	OO
all	OO
wrong	.O
not	OU
only	OO
is	OO
it	OO
easier	OO
to	OO
get	OO
rich	OO
in	OO
a	OO
social	OO
democracy	,O
but	OO
they	OO
are	OO
critical	OO
to	OO
the	OO
very	OO
institutions	OO
that	OO
have	OO
helped	OO
them	OO
get	OO
rich	.O
high	OU
taxes	,O
which	OO
gives	OO
free	OO
education	OO
and	OO
more	OO
talent	OO
into	OO
the	OO
economy	.O
strong	OU
unions	OO
that	OO
are	OO
helping	OO
to	OO
increase	OO
productivity	,O
and	OO
a	OO
generous	OO
welfare	OO
state	OO
that	OO
makes	OO
the	OO
unions	OO
accept	OO
downsizing	OO
because	OO
they	OO
know	OO
that	OO
their	OO
members	OO
will	OO
be	OO
well	OO
taken	OO
care	OO
of	.O
so	OU
the	OO
unions	OO
cooperate	OO
because	OO
of	OO
the	OO
safety	OO
net	.O
so	OU
rich	OO
people	OO
are	OO
a	OO
bit	OO
like	OO
immanuel	OU
kant's	OU
famous	OO
bird	,O
who	OO
thinks	OO
she	OO
could	OO
fly	OO
even	OO
faster	OO
in	OO
airless	OO
space	,O
forgetting	OO
that	OO
it's	OO
the	OO
air	OO
itself	OO
that	OO
gives	OO
her	OO
lift	.O
on	OU
the	OO
other	OO
part	OO
of	OO
the	OO
political	OO
spectrum	,O
when	OO
bernie	OU
sanders	OU
is	OO
praising	OO
scandinavian	OU
societies	,O
he	OO
forgets	OO
that	OO
these	OO
are	OO
not	OO
anti	OO
rich	OO
or	OO
anti	OO
capitalist	OO
systems	.O
because	OU
the	OO
welfare	OO
state	OO
and	OO
the	OO
unions	OO
work	OO
in	OO
tandem	OO
with	OO
capitalist	OO
dynamics	.O
and	OU
i	OU
think	OO
that	OO
is	OO
the	OO
most	OO
important	OO
lesson	OO
here	.O
the	OU
economy	OO
is	OO
not	OO
a	OO
zero	OO
sum	OO
game	.O
we	OU
are	OO
in	OO
this	OO
together	.O
and	OU
that	OO
is	OO
why	OO
scandinavia	OU
is	OO
a	OO
better	OO
place	OO
to	OO
fulfill	OO
the	OO
american	OU
dream	.O
than	OO
america	OU
itself	.O
thank	OU
you	OO
so	OO
much	.O
so	,U
on	OO
the	OO
day	OO
after	OO
the	OO
brexit	OU
vote	,O
in	OO
june	OU
2016	,O
when	OO
britain	OU
woke	OO
up	OO
to	OO
the	OO
shock	OO
of	OO
discovering	OO
that	OO
we're	OO
leaving	OO
the	OO
european	OU
union	,U
my	OO
editor	OO
at	OO
the	OO
observer	OU
newspaper	OO
in	OO
the	OO
uk	OU
asked	OO
me	OO
to	OO
go	OO
back	OO
to	OO
south	OU
wales	,U
where	OO
i	OU
grew	OO
up	,O
and	OO
to	OO
write	OO
a	OO
report	.O
and	OU
so	OO
i	OU
went	OO
to	OO
a	OO
town	OO
called	OO
ebbw	OU
vale	.U
here	OU
it	OO
is	.O
it's	OU
in	OO
the	OO
south	OU
wales	OU
valleys	,U
which	OO
is	OO
this	OO
quite	OO
special	OO
place	.O
so	OU
it's	OO
had	OO
this	OO
very	,O
sort	OO
of	OO
rich	,O
working	OO
class	OO
culture	,O
and	OO
it's	OO
famous	OO
for	OO
its	OO
welsh	OU
male	OO
voice	OO
choirs	OO
and	OO
rugby	OO
and	OO
its	OO
coal	.O
but	OU
when	OO
i	OU
was	OO
a	OO
teenager	,O
the	OO
coal	OO
mines	OO
and	OO
the	OO
steelworks	OO
closed	,O
and	OO
the	OO
entire	OO
area	OO
was	OO
devastated	.O
and	OU
i	OU
went	OO
there	OO
because	OO
it	OO
had	OO
one	OO
of	OO
the	OO
highest	OO
leave	OU
votes	OO
in	OO
the	OO
country	.O
sixty	OU
two	OO
percent	OO
of	OO
the	OO
people	OO
here	OO
voted	OO
to	OO
leave	OO
the	OO
european	OU
union	.U
and	OU
i	OU
wanted	OO
to	OO
know	OO
why	.O
when	OU
i	OU
got	OO
there	,O
i	OU
was	OO
just	OO
a	OO
bit	OO
taken	OO
aback	,O
because	OO
the	OO
last	OO
time	OO
i	OU
went	OO
to	OO
ebbw	OU
vale	,U
it	OO
looked	OO
like	OO
this	.O
and	OU
now	,O
it	OO
looks	OO
like	OO
this	.O
this	OU
is	OO
a	OO
new	OO
33	OO
million	OO
pound	OO
college	OO
of	OO
further	OO
education	OO
that	OO
was	OO
mostly	OO
funded	OO
by	OO
the	OO
european	OU
union	.U
and	OU
this	OO
is	OO
the	OO
new	OO
sports	OO
center	OO
that's	OO
at	OO
the	OO
middle	OO
of	OO
350	OO
million	OO
pound	OO
regeneration	OO
project	OO
that's	OO
being	OO
funded	OO
by	OO
the	OO
european	OU
union	.U
and	OU
this	OO
is	OO
the	OO
new	OO
77	OO
million	OO
pound	OO
road	OO
improvement	OO
scheme	,O
and	OO
there's	OO
a	OO
new	OO
train	OO
line	,O
a	OO

railway	OO
station	,O
and	OO
they're	OO
all	OO
being	OO
funded	OO
by	OO
the	OO
european	OU

and	OU
it's	OO
not	OO
as	OO
if	OO
any	OO
of	OO
this	OO
is	OO
a	OO
secret	,O
because	OO
there's	OO
big	OO
signs	OO
like	OO
this	OO
everywhere	.O
i	OU
had	OO
this	OO
sort	OO
of	OO
weird	OO
sense	OO
of	OO
unreality	,O
walking	OO
around	OO
the	OO
town	.O
and	OU
it	OO
came	OO
to	OO
a	OO
head	OO
when	OO
i	OU
met	OO
this	OO
young	OO
man	OO
in	OO
front	OO
of	OO
the	OO
sports	OO
center	.O
and	OU
he	OO
told	OO
me	OO
that	OO
he	OO
had	OO
voted	OO
to	OO
leave	,O
because	OO
the	OO
european	OU
union	OU
had	OO
done	OO
nothing	OO
for	OO
him	.O
he	OU
was	OO
fed	OO
up	OO
with	OO
it	.O
and	OU
all	OO
around	OO
town	,O
people	OO
told	OO
me	OO
the	OO
same	OO
thing	.O
they	OU
said	OO
that	OO
they	OO
wanted	OO
to	OO
take	OO
back	OO
control	,O
which	OO
was	OO
one	OO
of	OO
the	OO
slogans	OO
in	OO
the	OO
campaign	.O
and	OU
they	OO
told	OO
me	OO
that	OO
they	OO
were	OO
most	OO
fed	OO
up	OO
with	OO
the	OO
immigrants	OO
and	OO
with	OO
the	OO
refugees	.O
they'd	OU
had	OO
enough	.O
which	OU
was	OO
odd	.O
because	OU
walking	OO
around	,O
i	OU
didn't	OO
meet	OO
any	OO
immigrants	OO
or	OO
refugees	.O
i	OU
met	OO
one	OO
polish	OU
woman	OO
who	OO
told	OO
me	OO
she	OO
was	OO
practically	OO
the	OO
only	OO
foreigner	OO
in	OO
town	.O
and	OU
when	OO
i	OU
checked	OO
the	OO
figures	,O
i	OU
discovered	OO
that	OO
ebbw	OU
vale	OU
actually	OO
has	OO
one	OO
of	OO
the	OO
lowest	OO
rates	OO
of	OO
immigration	OO
in	OO
the	OO
country	.O
and	OU
so	OO
i	OU
was	OO
just	OO
a	OO
bit	OO
baffled	,O
because	OO
i	OU
couldn't	OO
really	OO
understand	OO
where	OO
people	OO
were	OO
getting	OO
their	OO
information	OO
from	.O
because	OU
it	OO
was	OO
the	OO
right	OO
wing	OO
tabloid	OO
newspapers	OO
which	OO
printed	OO
all	OO
these	OO
stories	OO
about	OO
immigration	.O
and	OU
this	OO
is	OO
a	OO
very	OO
much	OO
left	OO
wing	OO
labour	OU
stronghold	.O
but	OU
then	OO
after	OO
the	OO
article	OO
came	OO
out	,O
this	OO
woman	OO
got	OO
in	OO
touch	OO
with	OO
me	.O
and	OU
she	OO
was	OO
from	OO
ebbw	OU
vale	,U
and	OO
she	OO
told	OO
me	OO
about	OO
all	OO
this	OO
stuff	OO
that	OO
she'd	OO
seen	OO
on	OO
facebook	.U
i	OU
was	OO
like	,O
what	OU
stuff	?O
and	OU
she	OO
said	OO
it	OO
was	OO
all	OO
this	OO
quite	OO
scary	OO
stuff	OO
about	OO
immigration	,O
and	OO
especially	OO
about	OO
turkey	.U
so	OU
i	OU
tried	OO
to	OO
find	OO
it	.O
but	OU
there	OO
was	OO
nothing	OO
there	.O
because	OU
there's	OO
no	OO
archive	OO
of	OO
ads	OO
that	OO
people	OO
had	OO
seen	OO
or	OO
what	OO
had	OO
been	OO
pushed	OO
into	OO
their	OO
news	OO
feeds	.O
no	OU
trace	OO
of	OO
anything	,O
gone	OO
completely	OO
dark	.O
and	OU
this	OO
referendum	OO
that	OO
will	OO
have	OO
this	OO
profound	OO
effect	OO
forever	OO
on	OO
britain	OU
—	OO
it's	OO
already	OO
had	OO
a	OO
profound	OO
effect:	OO
the	OO
japanese	OU
car	OO
manufacturers	OO
that	OO
came	OO
to	OO
wales	OU
and	OO
the	OO
north	OO
east	OO
to	OO
replace	OO
the	OO
mining	OO
jobs	OO
—	OO
they	OO
are	OO
already	OO
going	OO
because	OO
of	OO
brexit	.U
and	OU
this	OO
entire	OO
referendum	OO
took	OO
place	OO
in	OO
darkness	,O
because	OO
it	OO
took	OO
place	OO
on	OO
facebook	.U
and	OU
what	OO
happens	OO
on	OO
facebook	OU
stays	OO
on	OO
facebook	,U
because	OO
only	OO
you	OO
see	OO
your	OO
news	OO
feed	,O
and	OO
then	OO
it	OO
vanishes	,O
so	OO
it's	OO
impossible	OO
to	OO
research	OO
anything	.O
so	OU
we	OO
have	OO
no	OO
idea	OO
who	OO
saw	OO
what	OO
ads	OO
or	OO
what	OO
impact	OO
they	OO
had	,O
or	OO
what	OO
data	OO
was	OO
used	OO
to	OO
target	OO
these	OO
people	.O
or	OU
even	OO
who	OO
placed	OO
the	OO
ads	,O
or	OO
how	OO
much	OO
money	OO
was	OO
spent	,O
or	OO
even	OO
what	OO
nationality	OO
they	OO
were	.O
but	OU
facebook	OU
does	.O
facebook	OU
has	OO
these	OO
answers	,O
and	OO
it's	OO
refused	OO
to	OO
give	OO
them	OO
to	OO
us	.O
our	OU
parliament	OO
has	OO
asked	OO
mark	OU
zuckerberg	OU
multiple	OO
times	OO
to	OO
come	OO
to	OO
britain	OU
and	OO
to	OO
give	OO
us	OO
these	OO
answers	.O
and	OU
every	OO
single	OO
time	,O
he's	OO
refused	.O
and	OU
you	OO
have	OO
to	OO
wonder	OO
why	.O
because	OU
what	OO
i	OU
and	OO
other	OO
journalists	OO
have	OO
uncovered	OO
is	OO
that	OO
multiple	OO
crimes	OO
took	OO
place	OO
during	OO
the	OO
referendum	.O
and	OU
they	OO
took	OO
place	OO
on	OO
facebook	.U
it's	OU
because	OO
in	OO
britain	,U
we	OO
limit	OO
the	OO
amount	OO
of	OO
money	OO
that	OO
you	OO
can	OO
spend	OO
in	OO
an	OO
election	.O
and	OU
it's	OO
because	OO
in	OO
the	OO
19th	OO
century	,O
people	OO
would	OO
walk	OO
around	OO
with	OO
literally	OO
wheelbarrows	OO
of	OO
cash	OO
and	OO
just	OO
buy	OO
voters	.O
so	OU
we	OO
passed	OO
these	OO
strict	OO
laws	OO
to	OO
stop	OO
that	OO
from	OO
happening	.O
but	OU
those	OO
laws	OO
don't	OO
work	OO
anymore	.O
this	OU
referendum	OO
took	OO
place	OO
almost	OO
entirely	OO
online	.O
and	OU
you	OO
can	OO
spend	OO
any	OO
amount	OO
of	OO
money	OO
on	OO
facebook	OU
or	OO
on	OO
google	OU
or	OO
on	OO
youtube	OU
ads	OO
and	OO
nobody	OO
will	OO
know	,O
because	OO
they're	OO
black	OO
boxes	.O
and	OU
this	OO
is	OO
what	OO
happened	.O
we've	OU
actually	OO
got	OO
no	OO
idea	OO
of	OO
the	OO
full	OO

it	.O

we	OO
do	OO

that	OO

the	OO

the	OO

the	OO

indeed	,O
this	OO
has	OO

the	OO
key	OO
idea	OO
of	OO
a	OO

field	OO
of	OO
research	OO
called	OO
soft	OO
robotics	.O
my	OU
research	OO
group	OO

the	OO

to	OO
the	OO
astonishing	OO
capabilities	OO
of	OO
the	OO

found	OO
in	OO
nature	.O
i've	OU
always	OO
been	OO
particularly	OO
inspired	OO
by	OO
biological	OO
muscle	.O
now	,U
that's	OO
not	OO
surprising	.O
i'm	OU
also	OO
austrian	,U
and	OO
i	OU
know	OO
that	OO
i	OU
sound	OO
a	OO
bit	OO
like	OO
arnie	,U
the	OO
terminator	.U
biological	OU
muscle	OO
is	OO
a	OO
true	OO
masterpiece	OO
of	OO
evolution	.O
it	OU
can	OO
heal	OO
after	OO
damage	OO
and	OO
it's	OO
tightly	OO
integrated	OO
with	OO
sensory	OO
neurons	OO
for	OO
feedback	OO
on	OO
motion	OO
and	OO
the	OO
environment	.O
it	OU
can	OO
contract	OO
fast	OO
enough	OO
to	OO
power	OO
the	OO
high	OO
speed	OO
wings	OO
of	OO
a	OO
hummingbird;	OO
it	OO
can	OO
grow	OO
strong	OO
enough	OO
to	OO
move	OO
an	OO
elephant;	OO
and	OO
it's	OO
adaptable	OO
enough	OO
to	OO
be	OO
used	OO
in	OO
the	OO
extremely	OO
versatile	OO
arms	OO
of	OO
an	OO
octopus	,O
an	OO
animal	OO
that	OO
can	OO
squeeze	OO
its	OO
entire	OO
body	OO
through	OO
tiny	OO
holes	.O
actuators	OU
are	OO
for	OO
robots	OO
what	OO
muscles	OO
are	OO
for	OO
animals:	OO
key	OO
components	OO
of	OO
the	OO
body	OO
that	OO
enable	OO
movement	OO
and	OO
interaction	OO
with	OO
the	OO
world	.O
so	OU
if	OO
we	OO
could	OO
build	OO
soft	OO
actuators	,O
or	OO
artificial	OO
muscles	,O
that	OO
are	OO
as	OO

and	OO

the	OO

but	OO
they	OO
all	OO
had	OO
remaining	OO
challenges	OO
that	OO
are	OO
hard	OO
to	OO
overcome	.O
in	OU
2015	,O
when	OO
i	OU
started	OO
my	OO
own	OO
lab	OO
at	OO
cu	OU
boulder	,U
i	OU
wanted	OO
to	OO
try	OO
an	OO
entirely	OO
new	OO
idea	.O
i	OU
wanted	OO
to	OO
combine	OO
the	OO
high	OO
speed	OO
and	OO
efficiency	OO
of	OO
electrically	OO
driven	OO
actuators	OO
with	OO
the	OO
versatility	OO
of	OO
soft	,O
fluidic	OO
actuators	.O
therefore	,U
i	OU
thought	,O
maybe	OO
i	OU
can	OO
try	OO
using	OO
really	OO
old	OO
science	OO
in	OO
a	OO
new	OO
way	.O
the	OU
diagram	OO
you	OO
see	OO
here	OO
shows	OO
an	OO
effect	OO
called	OO
maxwell	OU
stress	.O
when	OU
you	OO
take	OO
two	OO
metal	OO
plates	OO
and	OO
place	OO
them	OO
in	OO
a	OO
container	OO
filled	OO
with	OO
oil	,O
and	OO
then	OO
switch	OO
on	OO
a	OO
voltage	,O
the	OO
maxwell	OU
stress	OO
forces	OO
the	OO
oil	OO
up	OO
in	OO
between	OO
the	OO
two	OO
plates	,O
and	OO
that's	OO
what	OO
you	OO
see	OO
here	.O
so	OU
the	OO
key	OO
idea	OO
was	,O
can	OO
we	OO
use	OO
this	OO
effect	OO
to	OO
push	OO
around	OO
oil	OO
contained	OO
in	OO
soft	OO
stretchy	OO
structures	?O
and	OU
indeed	,O
this	OO
worked	OO
surprisingly	OO
well	,O
quite	OO
honestly	,O
much	OO
better	OO
than	OO
i	OU
expected	.O
together	OU
with	OO
my	OO
outstanding	OO
team	OO
of	OO
students	,O
we	OO
used	OO
this	OO
idea	OO
as	OO
a	OO
starting	OO
point	OO
to	OO
develop	OO
a	OO
new	OO
technology	OO
called	OO
hasel	OU
artificial	OO
muscles	.O
hasels	OU
are	OO
gentle	OO
enough	OO
to	OO
pick	OO
up	OO
a	OO
raspberry	OO
without	OO
damaging	OO
it	.O
they	OU
can	OO
expand	OO
and	OO
contract	OO
like	OO
real	OO
muscle	.O
and	OU
they	OO
can	OO
be	OO
operated	OO
faster	OO
than	OO
the	OO
real	OO
thing	.O
they	OU
can	OO
also	OO
be	OO
scaled	OO
up	OO
to	OO
deliver	OO
large	OO
forces	.O
here	OU
you	OO
see	OO
them	OO
lifting	OO
a	OO
gallon	OO
filled	OO
with	OO
water	.O
they	OU
can	OO
be	OO
used	OO
to	OO
drive	OO
a	OO
robotic	OO
arm	,O
and	OO
they	OO
can	OO
even	OO
self	OO
sense	OO
their	OO
position	.O
hasels	OU
can	OO
be	OO
used	OO
for	OO
very	OO
precise	OO
movement	,O
but	OO
they	OO
can	OO
also	OO
deliver	OO
very	OO
fluidic	,O
muscle	OO
like	OO
movement	OO
and	OO
bursts	OO
of	OO
power	OO
to	OO
shoot	OO
up	OO
a	OO
ball	OO
into	OO
the	OO
air	.O
when	OU
submerged	OO
in	OO
oil	,O
hasel	OU
artificial	OO
muscles	OO
can	OO
be	OO
made	OO
invisible	.O
so	OU
how	OO
do	OO
hasel	OU
artificial	OO
muscles	OO
work	?O
you	OU
might	OO
be	OO
surprised	.O
they're	OU
based	OO
on	OO
very	OO
inexpensive	,O
easily	OO
available	OO
materials	.O
you	OU
can	OO
even	OO
try	,O
and	OO
i	OU
recommend	OO
it	,O
the	OO
main	OO
principle	OO
at	OO
home	.O
take	OU
a	OO
few	OO
ziploc	OU
bags	OO
and	OO
fill	OO
them	OO
with	OO
olive	OO
oil	.O
try	OU
to	OO
push	OO
out	OO
air	OO
bubbles	OO
as	OO
much	OO
as	OO
you	OO
can	.O
now	OU
take	OO
a	OO
glass	OO
plate	OO
and	OO
place	OO
it	OO
on	OO
one	OO
side	OO
of	OO
the	OO
bag	.O
when	OU
you	OO
press	OO
down	,O
you	OO
see	OO
the	OO
bag	OO
contract	.O
now	OU
the	OO
amount	OO
of	OO
contraction	OO
is	OO
easy	OO
to	OO
control	.O
when	OU
you	OO
take	OO
a	OO
small	OO
weight	,O
you	OO
get	OO
a	OO
small	OO
contraction	.O
with	OU
a	OO
medium	OO
weight	,O
we	OO
get	OO
a	OO
medium	OO
contraction	.O
and	OU
with	OO
a	OO
large	OO
weight	,O
you	OO
get	OO
a	OO
large	OO
contraction	.O
now	OU
for	OO
hasels	,U
the	OO
only	OO
change	OO
is	OO
to	OO
replace	OO
the	OO
force	OO
of	OO
your	OO
hand	OO
or	OO
the	OO

with	OO
an	OO

here	OU
you	OO

a	OO
geometry	OO
called	OO
peano	OU
hasel	OU
actuators	,O
one	OO
of	OO
many	OO
possible	OO

again	,U
you	OO
take	OO
a	OO

you	OO
fill	OO
it	OO

such	OO
as	OO
olive	OO
oil	,O
and	OO
now	,O
instead	OO
of	OO
the	OO
glass	OO
plate	,O
you	OO
place	OO
an	OO
electrical	OO
conductor	OO
on	OO
one	OO

of	OO
the	OO
pouch	.O
to	OU
create	OO
something	OO
that	OO
looks	OO
more	OO

a	OO

you	OO
can	OO
connect	OO
a	OO

together	OO
and	OO
attached	OO
a	OO

on	OO
one	OO
side	.O
next	,U
we	OO
apply	OO

now	,U
the	OO

field	OO
starts	OO
acting	OO
on	OO
the	OO
liquid	.O
it	OU
displaces	OO
the	OO
liquid	,O
and	OO
it	OO
forces	OO
the	OO
muscle	OO
to	OO
contract	.O
here	OU
you	OO
see	OO
a	OO
completed	OO
peano	OU
hasel	OU
actuator	OO
and	OO
how	OO
it	OO
expands	OO
and	OO
contracts	OO
when	OO

viewed	OU
from	OO
the	OO

you	OO

those	OO

take	OO
a	OO
more	OO
cylindrical	OO
shape	,O
such	OO
as	OO
we	OO
saw	OO
with	OO
the	OO
ziploc	OU

we	OU
can	OO
also	OO
place	OO
a	OO
few	OO
such	OO

i	OU
know	OO
that	OO
sounds	OO
very	OO
scary	OO
at	OO

but	OU
when	OO
i	OU
think	OO
about	OO
my	OO

you	OO

even	OU
as	OO
i	OU
go	OO
to	OO
send	OO
a	OO
simple	OO
text	OO

that	OO

that	OO

when	OO

it	OO

with	OO
me	.O
and	OU
the	OO
good	OO
thing	OO
is	OO
it	OO

to	.O
because	OU
these	OO
beauty	OO
preferences	OO
that	OO
we	OO
have	,O
they're	OO
not	OO
something	OO
we	OO
are	OO
born	OO

they're	OO

and	OU
if	OO
they're	OO

they	OO
can	OO

among	OU
us	OO
are	OO
ceos	OU
and	OO
co	OO
founders	,O
directors	OO
of	OO
marketing	,O
you	OO
all	OO
are	OO
the	OO
arbiters	OO
of	OO
what	OO
society	OO
considers	OO
beautiful	OO
by	OO
deciding	OO
who	OO
you	OO
chose	OO
to	OO
put	OO
in	OO
your	OO
advertising	OO
or	OO
who	OO
you	OO
chose	OO
to	OO
be	OO
the	OO
face	OO
of	OO
you	OO

so	OU
you	OO
have	OO
the	OO
opportunity	OO
to	OO
make	OO
the	OO
unconventional	OO
choice	.O
and	OU
those	OO
of	OO
us	OO
that	OO
consume	OO
these	OO
messages	,O
we	OO
play	OO
our	OO
role	OO
too	.O
because	OU
the	OO
first	OO
step	OO
to	OO
change	OO
is	OO
awareness	.O
and	OU
now	OO
everyone	OO
in	OO
this	OO

a	OO
little	OO
more	OO
aware	OO
and	OO
will	OO
see	OO
the	OO
world	OO
just	OO
a	OO
little	OO
bit	OO
differently	.O
and	OU
you	OO
don't	OO
have	OO
to	OO
passively	OO
accept	OO
what	OO
society	OO
tells	OO
us	OO
to	OO
think	OO
is	OO
beautiful	.O
we	OU
can	OO
question	OO
it	,O
and	OO
we	OO
can	OO
challenge	OO
the	OO
status	OO
quo	.O
because	OU
when	OO
we	OO
do	,O
we	OO
get	OO
one	OO
step	OO
closer	OO
to	OO
broadening	OO
the	OO
standard	OO
of	OO
beauty	OO
and	OO
creating	OO
a	OO
society	OO
where	OO
the	OO

see	OO
that	OO

you	.O

what	OU

you	OO
right	OO
now	?O
you've	OU

very	OO
open	OO
about	OO

what	OU

your	OO

right	OO

jack	OU
dorsey:	OU
right	OU
now	,O
the	OO
health	OO
of	OO
the	OO
conversation	.O
so	,U
our	OO
purpose	OO
is	OO
to	OO
serve	OO
the	OO
public	OO
conversation	,O
and	OO
we	OO
have	OO
seen	OO
a	OO
number	OO
of	OO
attacks	OO
on	OO
it	.O
we've	OU
seen	OO
abuse	,O
we've	OO
seen	OO
harassment	,O
we've	OO
seen	OO
manipulation	,O
automation	,O
human	OO
coordination	,O
misinformation	.O
so	OU
these	OO
are	OO
all	OO
dynamics	OO
that	OO
we	OO
were	OO
not	OO
expecting	OO
13	OO
years	OO
ago	OO
when	OO
we	OO
were	OO
starting	OO
the	OO
company	.O
but	OU
we	OO
do	OO
now	OO
see	OO
them	OO
at	OO
scale	,O
and	OO
what	OO
worries	OO
me	OO
most	OO
is	OO
just	OO
our	OO
ability	OO
to	OO
address	OO
it	OO
in	OO
a	OO
systemic	OO
way	OO
that	OO
is	OO
scalable	,O
that	OO
has	OO
a	OO
rigorous	OO
understanding	OO
of	OO
how	OO
we're	OO
taking	OO
action	,O
a	OO
transparent	OO
understanding	OO
of	OO
how	OO
we're	OO
taking	OO
action	OO
and	OO
a	OO
rigorous	OO
appeals	OO
process	OO
for	OO
when	OO
we're	OO
wrong	,O
because	OO
we	OO
will	OO
be	OO
wrong	.O
whitney	OU
pennington	OU
rodgers:	OU
i'm	OU
really	OO
glad	OO
to	OO
hear	OO
that	OO
that's	OO
something	OO
that	OO
concerns	OO
you	,O
because	OO
i	OU
think	OO
there's	OO
been	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
written	OO
about	OO
people	OO
who	OO
feel	OO
they've	OO
been	OO
abused	OO
and	OO
harassed	OO
on	OO
twitter	,U
and	OO
i	OU
think	OO
no	OO
one	OO
more	OO
so	OO
than	OO
women	OO
and	OO
women	OO
of	OO
color	OO
and	OO
black	OO
women	.O
and	OU
there's	OO
been	OO
data	OO
that's	OO
come	OO
out	OO
—	OO
amnesty	OU
international	OU
put	OO
out	OO
a	OO
report	OO
a	OO
few	OO
months	OO
ago	OO
where	OO
they	OO
showed	OO
that	OO
a	OO
subset	OO
of	OO
active	OO
black	OO
female	OO
twitter	OU
users	OO
were	OO
receiving	,O
on	OO
average	,O
one	OO
in	OO
10	OO
of	OO
their	OO
tweets	OO
were	OO
some	OO
form	OO
of	OO
harassment	.O
and	OU
so	OO
when	OO
you	OO
think	OO
about	OO
health	OO
for	OO
the	OO
community	OO
on	OO
twitter	,U
i'm	OU
interested	OO
to	OO
hear	,O
health	OO
for	OO
everyone	,O
but	OO
specifically:	OO
how	OU
are	OO
you	OO
looking	OO
to	OO
make	OO
twitter	OU
a	OO
safe	OO
space	OO
for	OO
that	OO
subset	,O
for	OO
women	,O
for	OO
women	OO
of	OO
color	OO
and	OO
black	OO
women	?O
jd:	OU
yeah	.U
so	OU
it's	OO
a	OO
pretty	OO
terrible	OO
situation	OO
when	OO
you're	OO
coming	OO
to	OO
a	OO
service	OO
that	,O
ideally	,O
you	OO
want	OO
to	OO
learn	OO
something	OO
about	OO
the	OO
world	,O
and	OO
you	OO
spend	OO
the	OO
majority	OO
of	OO
your	OO
time	OO
reporting	OO
abuse	,O
receiving	OO
abuse	,O
receiving	OO
harassment	.O
so	OU
what	OO
we're	OO
looking	OO
most	OO
deeply	OO
at	OO
is	OO
just	OO
the	OO
incentives	OO
that	OO
the	OO
platform	OO
naturally	OO
provides	OO
and	OO
the	OO
service	OO
provides	.O
right	OU
now	,O
the	OO
dynamic	OO
of	OO
the	OO
system	OO
makes	OO
it	OO
super	OO
easy	OO
to	OO
harass	OO
and	OO
to	OO
abuse	OO
others	OO
through	OO
the	OO
service	,O
and	OO
unfortunately	,O
the	OO
majority	OO
of	OO
our	OO
system	OO
in	OO
the	OO
past	OO
worked	OO
entirely	OO
based	OO
on	OO
people	OO
reporting	OO
harassment	OO
and	OO
abuse	.O
so	OU
about	OO
midway	OO
last	OO
year	,O
we	OO
decided	OO
that	OO
we	OO
were	OO
going	OO
to	OO
apply	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
more	OO
machine	OO
learning	,O
a	OO
lot	OO
more	OO
deep	OO
learning	OO
to	OO
the	OO
problem	,O
and	OO
try	OO
to	OO
be	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
more	OO
proactive	OO
around	OO
where	OO
abuse	OO
is	OO
happening	,O
so	OO
that	OO
we	OO
can	OO
take	OO
the	OO
burden	OO
off	OO
the	OO
victim	OO
completely	.O
and	OU
we've	OO
made	OO
some	OO
progress	OO
recently	.O
about	OU
38	OO
percent	OO
of	OO
abusive	OO
tweets	OO
are	OO
now	OO
proactively	OO
identified	OO
by	OO
machine	OO
learning	OO
algorithms	OO
so	OO
that	OO
people	OO
don't	OO
actually	OO
have	OO
to	OO
report	OO
them	.O
but	OU
those	OO
that	OO
are	OO
identified	OO
are	OO
still	OO
reviewed	OO
by	OO
humans	,O
so	OO
we	OO
do	OO
not	OO
take	OO
down	OO
content	OO
or	OO
accounts	OO
without	OO
a	OO
human	OO
actually	OO
reviewing	OO
it	.O
but	OU
that	OO
was	OO
from	OO
zero	OO
percent	OO
just	OO
a	OO
year	OO
ago	.O
so	OU
that	OO
meant	,O
at	OO
that	OO
zero	OO
percent	,O
every	OO
single	OO
person	OO
who	OO
received	OO
abuse	OO
had	OO
to	OO
actually	OO
report	OO
it	,O
which	OO
was	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
work	OO
for	OO
them	,O
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
work	OO
for	OO
us	OO
and	OO
just	OO
ultimately	OO
unfair	.O
the	OU
other	OO
thing	OO
that	OO
we're	OO
doing	OO
is	OO
making	OO
sure	OO
that	OO
we	,O
as	OO
a	OO
company	,O
have	OO
representation	OO
of	OO
all	OO
the	OO
communities	OO
that	OO
we're	OO
trying	OO
to	OO
serve	.O
we	OU
can't	OO
build	OO
a	OO
business	OO
that	OO
is	OO
successful	OO
unless	OO
we	OO
have	OO
a	OO
diversity	OO
of	OO
perspective	OO
inside	OO
of	OO
our	OO
walls	OO
that	OO
actually	OO
feel	OO
these	OO
issues	OO
every	OO
single	OO
day	.O
and	OU
that's	OO
not	OO
just	OO
with	OO
the	OO
team	OO
that's	OO
doing	OO
the	OO
work	,O
it's	OO
also	OO
within	OO
our	OO
leadership	OO
as	OO
well	.O
so	OU
we	OO
need	OO
to	OO
continue	OO
to	OO
build	OO
empathy	OO
for	OO
what	OO
people	OO
are	OO
experiencing	OO
and	OO
give	OO
them	OO
better	OO
tools	OO
to	OO
act	OO
on	OO
it	OO
and	OO
also	OO
give	OO
our	OO
customers	OO
a	OO
much	OO
better	OO
and	OO
easier	OO
approach	OO
to	OO
handle	OO
some	OO
of	OO
the	OO
things	OO
that	OO
they're	OO
seeing	.O
so	OU
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
what	OO
we're	OO
doing	OO
is	OO
around	OO
technology	,O
but	OO
we're	OO
also	OO
looking	OO
at	OO
the	OO
incentives	OO
on	OO
the	OO
service:	OO
what	OU
does	OO
twitter	OU
incentivize	OO
you	OO
to	OO
do	OO
when	OO
you	OO
first	OO
open	OO
it	OO
up	?O
and	OU
in	OO
the	OO
past	,O
it's	OO
incented	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
outrage	,O
it's	OO
incented	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
mob	OO
behavior	,O
it's	OO
incented	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
group	OO
harassment	.O
and	OU
we	OO
have	OO
to	OO
look	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
deeper	OO
at	OO
some	OO
of	OO
the	OO
fundamentals	OO
of	OO
what	OO
the	OO
service	OO
is	OO
doing	OO
to	OO
make	OO
the	OO
bigger	OO
shifts	.O
we	OU
can	OO
make	OO
a	OO
bunch	OO
of	OO
small	OO
shifts	OO
around	OO
technology	,O
as	OO
i	OU
just	OO
described	,O
but	OO
ultimately	,O
we	OO
have	OO
to	OO
look	OO
deeply	OO
at	OO
the	OO
dynamics	OO
in	OO
the	OO
network	OO
itself	,O
and	OO
that's	OO
what	OO
we're	OO
doing	.O
ca:	OU
but	OU
what's	OO
your	OO
sense	OO
—	OO
what	OO
is	OO
the	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
thing	OO
that	OO
you	OO
might	OO
be	OO
able	OO
to	OO
change	OO
that	OO
would	OO
actually	OO
fundamentally	OO
shift	OO
behavior	?O
jd:	OU
well	,U
one	OO
of	OO
the	OO
things	OO
—	OO
we	OO
started	OO
the	OO
service	OO
with	OO
this	OO
concept	OO
of	OO
following	OO
an	OO
account	,O
as	OO
an	OO
example	,O
and	OO
i	OU
don't	OO
believe	OO
that's	OO
why	OO
people	OO
actually	OO
come	OO
to	OO
twitter	.U
i	OU
believe	OO
twitter	OU
is	OO
best	OO
as	OO
an	OO
interest	OO
based	OO
network	.O
people	OU
come	OO
with	OO
a	OO
particular	OO
interest	.O
they	OU
have	OO
to	OO
do	OO
a	OO
ton	OO
of	OO
work	OO
to	OO
find	OO
and	OO
follow	OO
the	OO
related	OO
accounts	OO
around	OO
those	OO
interests	.O
what	OU
we	OO
could	OO
do	OO
instead	OO
is	OO
allow	OO
you	OO
to	OO
follow	OO
an	OO
interest	,O
follow	OO
a	OO
hashtag	,O
follow	OO
a	OO
trend	,O
follow	OO
a	OO
community	,O
which	OO
gives	OO
us	OO
the	OO
opportunity	OO
to	OO
show	OO
all	OO
of	OO
the	OO
accounts	,O
all	OO
the	OO
topics	,O
all	OO
the	OO
moments	,O
all	OO
the	OO
hashtags	OO
that	OO
are	OO
associated	OO
with	OO
that	OO
particular	OO
topic	OO
and	OO
interest	,O
which	OO
really	OO
opens	OO
up	OO
the	OO
perspective	OO
that	OO
you	OO
see	.O
but	OU
that	OO
is	OO
a	OO
huge	OO
fundamental	OO
shift	OO
to	OO
bias	OO
the	OO
entire	OO
network	OO
away	OO
from	OO
just	OO
an	OO
account	OO
bias	OO
towards	OO
a	OO
topics	OO
and	OO
interest	OO
bias	.O
ca:	OU
because	OU
isn't	OO
it	OO
the	OO
case	OO
that	OO
one	OO
reason	OO
why	OO
you	OO
have	OO
so	OO
much	OO
content	OO
on	OO
there	OO
is	OO
a	OO
result	OO
of	OO
putting	OO
millions	OO
of	OO
people	OO
around	OO
the	OO
world	OO
in	OO
this	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
gladiatorial	OO
contest	OO
with	OO
each	OO
other	OO
for	OO
followers	,O
for	OO
attention	?O
like	,U
from	OO
the	OO
point	OO
of	OO
view	OO
of	OO
people	OO
who	OO
just	OO
read	OO
twitter	,U
that's	OO
not	OO
an	OO
issue	,O
but	OO
for	OO
the	OO
people	OO
who	OO
actually	OO
create	OO
it	,O
everyone's	OO
out	OO
there	OO
saying	,O
you	OU
know	,O
i	OU
wish	OO
i	OU
had	OO
a	OO
few	OO
more	OO
'likes,'	OO
followers	,O
retweets	.O
and	OU
so	OO
they're	OO
constantly	OO
experimenting	,O
trying	OO
to	OO
find	OO
the	OO
path	OO
to	OO
do	OO
that	.O
and	OU
what	OO
we've	OO
all	OO
discovered	OO
is	OO
that	OO
the	OO
number	OO
one	OO
path	OO
to	OO
do	OO
that	OO
is	OO
to	OO
be	OO
some	OO
form	OO
of	OO
provocative	,O
obnoxious	,O
eloquently	OO
obnoxious	,O
like	,O
eloquent	OO
insults	OO
are	OO
a	OO
dream	OO
on	OO
twitter	,U
where	OO
you	OO
rapidly	OO
pile	OO
up	OO
—	OO
and	OO
it	OO
becomes	OO
this	OO
self	OO
fueling	OO
process	OO
of	OO
driving	OO
outrage	.O
how	OU
do	OO
you	OO
defuse	OO
that	?O
jd:	OU
yeah	,U
i	OU
mean	,O
i	OU
think	OO
you're	OO
spot	OO
on	,O
but	OO
that	OO
goes	OO
back	OO
to	OO
the	OO
incentives	.O
like	,U
one	OO
of	OO
the	OO
choices	OO
we	OO
made	OO
in	OO
the	OO
early	OO
days	OO
was	OO
we	OO
had	OO
this	OO
number	OO
that	OO
showed	OO
how	OO
many	OO
people	OO
follow	OO
you	.O
we	OU
decided	OO
that	OO
number	OO
should	OO
be	OO
big	OO
and	OO
bold	,O
and	OO
anything	OO
that's	OO
on	OO
the	OO
page	OO
that's	OO
big	OO
and	OO
bold	OO
has	OO
importance	,O
and	OO
those	OO
are	OO
the	OO
things	OO
that	OO
you	OO
want	OO
to	OO
drive	.O
was	OU
that	OO
the	OO
right	OO
decision	OO
at	OO
the	OO
time	?O
probably	OU
not	.O
if	OU
i	OU
had	OO
to	OO
start	OO
the	OO
service	OO
again	,O
i	OU
would	OO
not	OO
emphasize	OO
the	OO
follower	OO
count	OO
as	OO
much	.O
i	OU
would	OO
not	OO
emphasize	OO
the	OO
like	OO
count	OO
as	OO
much	.O
i	OU
don't	OO
think	OO
i	OU
would	OO
even	OO
create	OO
like	OO
in	OO
the	OO
first	OO
place	,O
because	OO
it	OO
doesn't	OO
actually	OO
push	OO
what	OO
we	OO
believe	OO
now	OO
to	OO
be	OO
the	OO
most	OO
important	OO
thing	,O
which	OO
is	OO
healthy	OO
contribution	OO
back	OO
to	OO
the	OO
network	OO
and	OO
conversation	OO
to	OO
the	OO
network	,O
participation	OO
within	OO
conversation	,O
learning	OO
something	OO
from	OO
the	OO
conversation	.O
those	OU
are	OO
not	OO
things	OO
that	OO
we	OO
thought	OO
of	OO
13	OO
years	OO
ago	,O
and	OO
we	OO
believe	OO
are	OO
extremely	OO
important	OO
right	OO
now	.O
so	OU
we	OO
have	OO
to	OO
look	OO
at	OO
how	OO
we	OO
display	OO
the	OO
follower	OO
count	,O
how	OO
we	OO
display	OO
retweet	OO
count	,O
how	OO
we	OO
display	OO
likes	,O
and	OO
just	OO
ask	OO
the	OO
deep	OO
question:	OO
is	OU
this	OO
really	OO
the	OO
number	OO
that	OO
we	OO
want	OO
people	OO
to	OO
drive	OO
up	?O
is	OU
this	OO
the	OO
thing	OO
that	,O
when	OO
you	OO
open	OO
twitter	,U
you	OO
see	,O
that's	OU
the	OO
thing	OO
i	OU
need	OO
to	OO
increase	?O
and	OU
i	OU
don't	OO
believe	OO
that's	OO
the	OO
case	OO
right	OO
now	.O
wpr:	OU
i	OU
think	OO
we	OO
should	OO
look	OO
at	OO
some	OO
of	OO
the	OO
tweets	OO
that	OO
are	OO
coming	OO
in	OO
from	OO
the	OO
audience	OO
as	OO
well	.O
ca:	OU
let's	OU
see	OO
what	OO
you	OO
guys	OO
are	OO
asking	.O
i	OU
mean	,O
this	OO
is	OO
—	OO
generally	,O
one	OO
of	OO
the	OO
amazing	OO
things	OO
about	OO
twitter	OU
is	OO
how	OO
you	OO
can	OO
use	OO
it	OO
for	OO
crowd	OO
wisdom	,O
you	OO
know	,O
that	OO
more	OO
knowledge	,O
more	OO
questions	,O
more	OO
points	OO
of	OO

than	OO
you	OO
can	OO
imagine	,O
and	OO
sometimes	,O
many	OO
of	OO
them	OO
are	OO
really	OO
healthy	.O
wpr:	OU
i	OU
think	OO
one	OO
i	OU
saw	OO
that	OO
passed	OO
already	OO
quickly	OO
down	OO
here	,O
what's	OU
twitter's	OU
plan	OO
to	OO
combat	OO
foreign	OO
meddling	OO
in	OO
the	OO
2020	OO
us	OU
election	?O
i	OU
think	OO
that's	OO
something	OO
that's	OO
an	OO
issue	OO
we're	OO
seeing	OO
on	OO
the	OO
internet	OO
in	OO
general	,O
that	OO
we	OO
have	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
malicious	OO
automated	OO
activity	OO
happening	.O
and	OU
on	OO
twitter	,U
for	OO
example	,O
in	OO
fact	,O
we	OO
have	OO
some	OO
work	OO
that's	OO
come	OO
from	OO
our	OO
friends	OO
at	OO
zignal	OU
labs	,U
and	OO
maybe	OO
we	OO
can	OO
even	OO
see	OO
that	OO
to	OO
give	OO
us	OO
an	OO
example	OO
of	OO
what	OO
exactly	OO
i'm	OU
talking	OO
about	,O
where	OO
you	OO
have	OO
these	OO
bots	,O
if	OO
you	OO
will	,O
or	OO
coordinated	OO
automated	OO
malicious	OO
account	OO
activity	,O
that	OO
is	OO
being	OO
used	OO
to	OO
influence	OO
things	OO
like	OO
elections	.O
and	OU
in	OO
this	OO
example	OO
we	OO
have	OO
from	OO
zignal	OU
which	OO
they've	OO
shared	OO
with	OO
us	OO
using	OO
the	OO
data	OO
that	OO
they	OO
have	OO
from	OO

you	OO

the	OU
pinker	OO
it	OO

the	OO

you	OO

see	OO
how	OO
you	OO
have	OO
a	OO
few	OO
humans	OO
interacting	OO
with	OO
bots	.O
in	OU
this	OO
case	,O
it's	OO
related	OO
to	OO
the	OO
election	OO
in	OO
israel	OU
and	OO
spreading	OO
misinformation	OO
about	OO
benny	OU
gantz	,U
and	OO
as	OO
we	OO
know	,O
in	OO
the	OO
end	,O
that	OO
was	OO
an	OO
election	OO
that	OO
netanyahu	OU
won	OO
by	OO
a	OO
slim	OO
margin	,O
and	OO
that	OO
may	OO
have	OO
been	OO
in	OO
some	OO
case	OO
influenced	OO
by	OO
this	.O
and	OU
when	OO
you	OO
think	OO
about	OO
that	OO
happening	OO
on	OO
twitter	,U
what	OO
are	OO
the	OO
things	OO
that	OO
you're	OO
doing	,O
specifically	,O
to	OO
ensure	OO
you	OO
don't	OO
have	OO
misinformation	OO
like	OO
this	OO
spreading	OO
in	OO
this	OO
way	,O
influencing	OO
people	OO
in	OO
ways	OO
that	OO
could	OO
affect	OO
democracy	?O
jd:	OU
just	OU
to	OO
back	OO
up	OO
a	OO
bit	,O
we	OO
asked	OO
ourselves	OO
a	OO
question:	OO
can	OU
we	OO
actually	OO
measure	OO
the	OO
health	OO
of	OO
a	OO
conversation	,O
and	OO
what	OO
does	OO
that	OO
mean	?O
and	OU
in	OO
the	OO
same	OO
way	OO
that	OO
you	OO
have	OO
indicators	OO
and	OO
we	OO
have	OO
indicators	OO
as	OO
humans	OO
in	OO
terms	OO
of	OO
are	OO
we	OO
healthy	OO
or	OO
not	,O
such	OO
as	OO
temperature	,O
the	OO
flushness	OO
of	OO
your	OO
face	,O
we	OO
believe	OO
that	OO
we	OO
could	OO
find	OO
the	OO
indicators	OO
of	OO
conversational	OO
health	.O
and	OU
we	OO
worked	OO
with	OO
a	OO
lab	OO
called	OO
cortico	OU
at	OO
mit	OU
to	OO
propose	OO
four	OO
starter	OO
indicators	OO
that	OO
we	OO
believe	OO
we	OO
could	OO
ultimately	OO
measure	OO
on	OO
the	OO
system	.O
and	OU
the	OO
first	OO
one	OO
is	OO
what	OO
we're	OO
calling	OO
shared	OO
attention	.O
it's	OU
a	OO
measure	OO
of	OO
how	OO
much	OO
of	OO
the	OO
conversation	OO
is	OO
attentive	OO
on	OO
the	OO
same	OO
topic	OO
versus	OO
disparate	.O
the	OU
second	OO
one	OO
is	OO
called	OO
shared	OO
reality	,O
and	OO
this	OO
is	OO
what	OO
percentage	OO
of	OO
the	OO
conversation	OO
shares	OO
the	OO
same	OO
facts	OO
—	OO
not	OO
whether	OO
those	OO
facts	OO
are	OO
truthful	OO
or	OO
not	,O
but	OO
are	OO
we	OO
sharing	OO
the	OO
same	OO
facts	OO
as	OO
we	OO
converse	?O
the	OU
third	OO
is	OO
receptivity:	OO
how	OU
much	OO
of	OO
the	OO
conversation	OO
is	OO
receptive	OO
or	OO
civil	OO
or	OO
the	OO
inverse	,O
toxic	?O
and	OU
then	OO
the	OO
fourth	OO
is	OO
variety	OO
of	OO
perspective	.O
so	,U
are	OO
we	OO
seeing	OO
filter	OO
bubbles	OO
or	OO
echo	OO
chambers	,O
or	OO
are	OO
we	OO
actually	OO
getting	OO
a	OO
variety	OO
of	OO
opinions	OO
within	OO
the	OO
conversation	?O
and	OU
implicit	OO
in	OO
all	OO
four	OO
of	OO
these	OO
is	OO
the	OO
understanding	OO
that	,O
as	OO
they	OO
increase	,O
the	OO
conversation	OO
gets	OO
healthier	OO
and	OO
healthier	.O
so	OU
our	OO
first	OO
step	OO
is	OO
to	OO
see	OO
if	OO
we	OO
can	OO
measure	OO
these	OO
online	,O
which	OO
we	OO
believe	OO
we	OO
can	.O
we	OU
have	OO
the	OO
most	OO
momentum	OO
around	OO
receptivity	.O
we	OU
have	OO
a	OO
toxicity	OO
score	,O
a	OO
toxicity	OO
model	,O
on	OO
our	OO
system	OO
that	OO
can	OO
actually	OO
measure	OO
whether	OO
you	OO
are	OO
likely	OO
to	OO
walk	OO
away	OO
from	OO
a	OO
conversation	OO
that	OO
you're	OO
having	OO
on	OO
twitter	OU
because	OO
you	OO
feel	OO
it's	OO
toxic	,O
with	OO
some	OO
pretty	OO
high	OO
degree	.O
we're	OU
working	OO
to	OO
measure	OO
the	OO
rest	,O
and	OO
the	OO
next	OO
step	OO
is	,O
as	OO
we	OO
build	OO
up	OO
solutions	,O
to	OO
watch	OO
how	OO
these	OO
measurements	OO
trend	OO
over	OO
time	OO
and	OO
continue	OO
to	OO
experiment	.O
and	OU
our	OO
goal	OO
is	OO
to	OO
make	OO
sure	OO
that	OO
these	OO
are	OO
balanced	,O
because	OO
if	OO
you	OO
increase	OO
one	,O
you	OO
might	OO
decrease	OO
another	.O
if	OU
you	OO
increase	OO
variety	OO
of	OO
perspective	,O
you	OO
might	OO
actually	OO
decrease	OO
shared	OO
reality	.O
ca:	OU
just	OU
picking	OO
up	OO
on	OO
some	OO
of	OO
the	OO
questions	OO
flooding	OO
in	OO
here	.O
jd:	OU
constant	OU
questioning	.O
ca:	OU
a	OU
lot	OO
of	OO
people	OO
are	OO
puzzled	OO
why	,O
like	,O
how	OO
hard	OO
is	OO
it	OO
to	OO
get	OO
rid	OO
of	OO
nazis	OU
from	OO
twitter	?U
jd:	OU
so	OU
we	OO
have	OO
policies	OO
around	OO
violent	OO
extremist	OO
groups	,O
and	OO
the	OO
majority	OO
of	OO
our	OO
work	OO
and	OO
our	OO
terms	OO
of	OO
service	OO
works	OO
on	OO
conduct	,O
not	OO
content	.O
so	OU
we're	OO
actually	OO
looking	OO
for	OO
conduct	.O
conduct	OU
being	OO
using	OO
the	OO
service	OO
to	OO
repeatedly	OO
or	OO
episodically	OO
harass	OO
someone	,O
using	OO
hateful	OO
imagery	OO
that	OO
might	OO
be	OO
associated	OO
with	OO
the	OO
kkk	OU
or	OO
the	OO
american	OU
nazi	OU
party	.U
those	OU
are	OO
all	OO
things	OO
that	OO
we	OO
act	OO
on	OO
immediately	.O
we're	OU
in	OO
a	OO
situation	OO
right	OO
now	OO
where	OO
that	OO
term	OO
is	OO
used	OO
fairly	OO
loosely	,O
and	OO
we	OO
just	OO
cannot	OO
take	OO
any	OO
one	OO
mention	OO
of	OO
that	OO
word	OO
accusing	OO
someone	OO
else	OO
as	OO
a	OO
factual	OO
indication	OO
that	OO
they	OO
should	OO
be	OO
removed	OO
from	OO
the	OO
platform	.O
so	OU
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
our	OO
models	OO
are	OO
based	OO
around	,O
number	OO
one:	OO
is	OU
this	OO
account	OO
associated	OO
with	OO
a	OO
violent	OO
extremist	OO
group	?O
and	OU
if	OO
so	,O
we	OO
can	OO
take	OO
action	.O
and	OU
we	OO
have	OO
done	OO
so	OO
on	OO
the	OO
kkk	OU
and	OO
the	OO
american	OU
nazi	OU
party	OU
and	OO
others	.O
and	OU
number	OO
two:	OO
are	OU
they	OO
using	OO
imagery	OO
or	OO
conduct	OO
that	OO
would	OO
associate	OO
them	OO
as	OO
such	OO
as	OO
well	?O
ca:	OU
how	OU
many	OO
people	OO
do	OO
you	OO
have	OO
working	OO
on	OO
content	OO
moderation	OO
to	OO
look	OO
at	OO
this	?O
jd:	OU
it	OU
varies	.O
we	OU
want	OO
to	OO
be	OO
flexible	OO
on	OO
this	,O
because	OO
we	OO
want	OO
to	OO
make	OO
sure	OO
that	OO
we're	,O
number	OO
one	,O
building	OO
algorithms	OO
instead	OO
of	OO
just	OO
hiring	OO
massive	OO
amounts	OO
of	OO
people	,O
because	OO
we	OO
need	OO
to	OO
make	OO
sure	OO
that	OO
this	OO
is	OO
scalable	,O
and	OO
there	OO
are	OO
no	OO
amount	OO
of	OO
people	OO
that	OO
can	OO
actually	OO
scale	OO
this	.O
so	OU
this	OO
is	OO
why	OO
we've	OO
done	OO
so	OO
much	OO
work	OO
around	OO
proactive	OO
detection	OO
of	OO
abuse	OO
that	OO
humans	OO
can	OO
then	OO
review	.O
we	OU
want	OO
to	OO
have	OO
a	OO
situation	OO
where	OO
algorithms	OO
are	OO
constantly	OO
scouring	OO
every	OO
single	OO
tweet	OO
and	OO
bringing	OO
the	OO
most	OO
interesting	OO
ones	OO
to	OO
the	OO
top	OO
so	OO
that	OO
humans	OO
can	OO
bring	OO
their	OO
judgment	OO
to	OO
whether	OO
we	OO
should	OO
take	OO
action	OO
or	OO
not	,O
based	OO
on	OO
our	OO
terms	OO
of	OO
service	.O
wpr:	OU
but	OU
there's	OO
not	OO
an	OO
amount	OO
of	OO
people	OO
that	OO
are	OO
scalable	,O
but	OO
how	OO
many	OO
people	OO
do	OO
you	OO
currently	OO
have	OO
monitoring	OO
these	OO
accounts	,O
and	OO
how	OO
do	OO
you	OO
figure	OO
out	OO
what's	OO
enough	?O
jd:	OU
they're	OU
completely	OO
flexible	.O
sometimes	OU
we	OO
associate	OO
folks	OO
with	OO
spam	.O
sometimes	OU
we	OO
associate	OO
folks	OO
with	OO
abuse	OO
and	OO
harassment	.O
we're	OU
going	OO
to	OO
make	OO
sure	OO
that	OO
we	OO
have	OO
flexibility	OO
in	OO
our	OO
people	OO
so	OO
that	OO
we	OO
can	OO
direct	OO
them	OO
at	OO
what	OO
is	OO
most	OO
needed	.O
sometimes	,U
the	OO
elections	.O
we've	OU
had	OO
a	OO
string	OO
of	OO
elections	OO
in	OO
mexico	,U
one	OO
coming	OO
up	OO
in	OO
india	,U
obviously	,O
the	OO
election	OO
last	OO
year	,O
the	OO
midterm	OO
election	,O
so	OO
we	OO
just	OO
want	OO
to	OO
be	OO
flexible	OO
with	OO
our	OO
resources	.O
so	OU
when	OO
people	OO
—	OO
just	OO
as	OO
an	OO
example	,O
if	OO
you	OO
go	OO
to	OO
our	OO
current	OO
terms	OO
of	OO
service	OO
and	OO
you	OO
bring	OO
the	OO
page	OO
up	,O
and	OO
you're	OO
wondering	OO
about	OO
abuse	OO
and	OO
harassment	OO
that	OO
you	OO
just	OO
received	OO
and	OO
whether	OO
it	OO
was	OO
against	OO
our	OO
terms	OO
of	OO
service	OO
to	OO
report	OO
it	,O
the	OO
first	OO
thing	OO
you	OO
see	OO
when	OO
you	OO
open	OO
that	OO
page	OO
is	OO
around	OO
intellectual	OO
property	OO
protection	.O
you	OU
scroll	OO
down	OO
and	OO
you	OO
get	OO
to	OO
abuse	,O
harassment	OO
and	OO
everything	OO
else	OO
that	OO
you	OO
might	OO
be	OO
experiencing	.O
so	OU
i	OU
don't	OO
know	OO
how	OO
that	OO
happened	OO
over	OO
the	OO
company's	OO
history	,O
but	OO
we	OO
put	OO
that	OO
above	OO
the	OO
thing	OO
that	OO
people	OO
want	OO
the	OO
most	OO
information	OO
on	OO
and	OO
to	OO
actually	OO
act	OO
on	.O
and	OU
just	OO
our	OO
ordering	OO
shows	OO
the	OO
world	OO
what	OO
we	OO
believed	OO
was	OO
important	.O
so	OU
we're	OO
changing	OO
all	OO
that	.O
we're	OU
ordering	OO
it	OO
the	OO
right	OO
way	,O
but	OO
we're	OO
also	OO
simplifying	OO
the	OO
rules	OO
so	OO
that	OO
they're	OO
human	OO
readable	OO
so	OO
that	OO
people	OO
can	OO
actually	OO
understand	OO
themselves	OO
when	OO
something	OO
is	OO
against	OO
our	OO
terms	OO
and	OO
when	OO
something	OO
is	OO
not	.O
and	OU
then	OO
we're	OO
making	OO
—	OO
again	,O
our	OO
big	OO
focus	OO
is	OO
on	OO
removing	OO
the	OO
burden	OO
of	OO
work	OO
from	OO
the	OO
victims	.O
so	OU
that	OO
means	OO
push	OO
more	OO
towards	OO
technology	,O
rather	OO
than	OO
humans	OO
doing	OO
the	OO
work	OO
—	OO
that	OO
means	OO
the	OO
humans	OO
receiving	OO
the	OO
abuse	OO
and	OO
also	OO
the	OO
humans	OO
having	OO
to	OO
review	OO
that	OO
work	.O
so	OU
we	OO
want	OO
to	OO
make	OO
sure	OO
that	OO
we're	OO
not	OO
just	OO
encouraging	OO
more	OO
work	OO
around	OO
something	OO
that's	OO
super	,O
super	OO
negative	,O
and	OO
we	OO
want	OO
to	OO
have	OO
a	OO
good	OO
balance	OO
between	OO
the	OO
technology	OO
and	OO
where	OO
humans	OO
can	OO
actually	OO
be	OO
creative	,O
which	OO
is	OO
the	OO
judgment	OO
of	OO
the	OO
rules	,O
and	OO
not	OO
just	OO
all	OO
the	OO
mechanical	OO
stuff	OO
of	OO
finding	OO
and	OO
reporting	OO
them	.O
so	OU
that's	OO
how	OO
we	OO
think	OO
about	OO
it	.O
ca:	OU
i'm	OU
curious	OO
to	OO
dig	OO
in	OO
more	OO
about	OO
what	OO
you	OO
said	.O
i	OU
mean	,O
i	OU
love	OO
that	OO
you	OO
said	OO
you	OO
are	OO
looking	OO
for	OO
ways	OO
to	OO
re	OO
tweak	OO
the	OO
fundamental	OO
design	OO
of	OO
the	OO
system	OO
to	OO
discourage	OO
some	OO
of	OO
the	OO
reactive	OO
behavior	,O
and	OO
perhaps	OO
—	OO
to	OO
use	OO
tristan	OU
harris	OU
type	OO
language	OO
—	OO
engage	OO
people's	OO
more	OO
reflective	OO
thinking	.O
how	OU
far	OO
advanced	OO
is	OO
that	?O
what	OU
would	OO
alternatives	OO
to	OO
that	OO
like	OO
button	OO
be	?O
jd:	OU
well	,U
first	OO
and	OO
foremost	,O
my	OO
personal	OO
goal	OO
with	OO
the	OO
service	OO
is	OO
that	OO
i	OU
believe	OO
fundamentally	OO
that	OO
public	OO
conversation	OO
is	OO
critical	.O
there	OU
are	OO
existential	OO
problems	OO
facing	OO
the	OO
world	OO
that	OO
are	OO
facing	OO
the	OO
entire	OO
world	,O
not	OO
any	OO
one	OO
particular	OO
nation	OO
state	,O
that	OO
global	OO
public	OO
conversation	OO
benefits	.O
and	OU
that	OO
is	OO
one	OO
of	OO
the	OO
unique	OO
dynamics	OO
of	OO
twitter	,U
that	OO
it	OO
is	OO
completely	OO
open	,O
it	OO
is	OO
completely	OO
public	,O
it	OO
is	OO
completely	OO
fluid	,O
and	OO
anyone	OO
can	OO
see	OO
any	OO
other	OO
conversation	OO
and	OO
participate	OO
in	OO
it	.O
so	OU
there	OO
are	OO
conversations	OO
like	OO
climate	OO
change	.O
there	OU
are	OO
conversations	OO
like	OO
the	OO
displacement	OO
in	OO
the	OO
work	OO
through	OO
artificial	OO
intelligence	.O
there	OU
are	OO
conversations	OO
like	OO
economic	OO
disparity	.O
no	OU
matter	OO
what	OO
any	OO
one	OO
nation	OO
state	OO
does	,O
they	OO
will	OO
not	OO
be	OO
able	OO
to	OO
solve	OO
the	OO
problem	OO
alone	.O
it	OU
takes	OO
coordination	OO
around	OO
the	OO
world	,O
and	OO
that's	OO
where	OO
i	OU
think	OO
twitter	OU
can	OO
play	OO
a	OO
part	.O
the	OU
second	OO
thing	OO
is	OO
that	OO
twitter	,U
right	OO
now	,O
when	OO
you	OO
go	OO
to	OO
it	,O
you	OO
don't	OO
necessarily	OO
walk	OO
away	OO
feeling	OO
like	OO
you	OO
learned	OO
something	.O
some	OU
people	OO
do	.O
some	OU
people	OO
have	OO
a	OO
very	,O
very	OO
rich	OO
network	,O
a	OO
very	OO
rich	OO
community	OO
that	OO
they	OO
learn	OO
from	OO
every	OO
single	OO
day	.O
but	OU
it	OO
takes	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
work	OO
and	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
time	OO
to	OO
build	OO
up	OO
to	OO
that	.O
so	OU
we	OO
want	OO
to	OO
get	OO
people	OO
to	OO
those	OO
topics	OO
and	OO
those	OO
interests	OO
much	,O
much	OO
faster	OO
and	OO
make	OO
sure	OO
that	OO
they're	OO
finding	OO
something	OO
that	,O
no	OO
matter	OO
how	OO
much	OO
time	OO
they	OO
spend	OO
on	OO
twitter	OU
—	OO
and	OO
i	OU
don't	OO
want	OO
to	OO
maximize	OO
the	OO
time	OO
on	OO
twitter	,U
i	OU
want	OO
to	OO
maximize	OO
what	OO
they	OO
actually	OO
take	OO
away	OO
from	OO
it	OO
and	OO
what	OO
they	OO
learn	OO
from	OO
it	,O
and	OO
—	OO
ca:	OU
well	,U
do	OO
you	,O
though	?O
because	OU
that's	OO
the	OO
core	OO
question	OO
that	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
people	OO
want	OO
to	OO
know	.O
surely	,U
jack	,U
you're	OO
constrained	,O
to	OO
a	OO
huge	OO
extent	,O
by	OO
the	OO
fact	OO
that	OO
you're	OO
a	OO
public	OO
company	,O
you've	OO
got	OO
investors	OO
pressing	OO
on	OO
you	,O
the	OO
number	OO
one	OO
way	OO
you	OO
make	OO
your	OO
money	OO
is	OO
from	OO
advertising	OO
—	OO
that	OO
depends	OO
on	OO
user	OO
engagement	.O
are	OU
you	OO
willing	OO
to	OO
sacrifice	OO
user	OO
time	,O
if	OO
need	OO
be	,O
to	OO
go	OO
for	OO
a	OO
more	OO
reflective	OO
conversation	?O
jd:	OU
yeah;	OU
more	OO
relevance	OO
means	OO
less	OO
time	OO
on	OO
the	OO
service	,O
and	OO
that's	OO
perfectly	OO
fine	,O
because	OO
we	OO
want	OO
to	OO
make	OO
sure	OO
that	,O
like	,O
you're	OO
coming	OO
to	OO
twitter	,U
and	OO
you	OO
see	OO
something	OO
immediately	OO
that	OO
you	OO
learn	OO
from	OO
and	OO
that	OO
you	OO
push	.O
we	OU
can	OO
still	OO
serve	OO
an	OO
ad	OO
against	OO
that	.O
that	OU
doesn't	OO
mean	OO
you	OO
need	OO
to	OO
spend	OO
any	OO
more	OO
time	OO
to	OO
see	OO
more	.O
the	OU
second	OO
thing	OO
we're	OO
looking	OO
at	OO
—	OO
ca:	OU
but	OU
just	OO
—	OO
on	OO
that	OO
goal	,O
daily	OO
active	OO
usage	,O
if	OO
you're	OO
measuring	OO
that	,O
that	OO
doesn't	OO
necessarily	OO
mean	OO
things	OO
that	OO
people	OO
value	OO
every	OO
day	.O
it	OU
may	OO
well	OO
mean	OO
things	OO
that	OO
people	OO
are	OO
drawn	OO
to	OO
like	OO
a	OO
moth	OO
to	OO
the	OO
flame	,O
every	OO
day	.O
we	OU
are	OO
addicted	,O
because	OO
we	OO
see	OO
something	OO
that	OO
pisses	OO
us	OO
off	,O
so	OO
we	OO
go	OO
in	OO
and	OO
add	OO
fuel	OO
to	OO
the	OO
fire	,O
and	OO
the	OO
daily	OO
active	OO
usage	OO
goes	OO
up	,O
and	OO
there's	OO
more	OO
ad	OO
revenue	OO
there	,O
but	OO
we	OO
all	OO
get	OO
angrier	OO
with	OO
each	OO
other	.O
how	OU
do	OO
you	OO
define	.O
daily	OU
active	OO
usage	OO
seems	OO
like	OO
a	OO
really	OO
dangerous	OO
term	OO
to	OO
be	OO
optimizing	.O
jd:	OU
taken	OU
alone	,O
it	OO
is	,O
but	OO
you	OO
didn't	OO
let	OO
me	OO
finish	OO
the	OO
other	OO
metric	,O
which	OO
is	,O
we're	OO
watching	OO
for	OO
conversations	OO
and	OO
conversation	OO
chains	.O
so	OU
we	OO
want	OO
to	OO
incentivize	OO
healthy	OO
contribution	OO
back	OO
to	OO
the	OO
network	,O
and	OO
what	OO
we	OO
believe	OO
that	OO
is	OO
is	OO
actually	OO
participating	OO
in	OO
conversation	OO
that	OO
is	OO
healthy	,O
as	OO
defined	OO
by	OO
those	OO
four	OO
indicators	OO
i	OU
articulated	OO
earlier	.O
so	OU
you	OO
can't	OO
just	OO
optimize	OO
around	OO
one	OO
metric	.O
you	OU
have	OO
to	OO
balance	OO
and	OO
look	OO
constantly	OO
at	OO
what	OO
is	OO
actually	OO
going	OO
to	OO
create	OO
a	OO
healthy	OO
contribution	OO
to	OO
the	OO
network	OO
and	OO
a	OO
healthy	OO
experience	OO
for	OO
people	.O
ultimately	,U
we	OO
want	OO
to	OO
get	OO
to	OO
a	OO
metric	OO
where	OO
people	OO
can	OO
tell	OO
us	,O
hey	,U
i	OU
learned	OO
something	OO
from	OO
twitter	,U
and	OO
i'm	OU
walking	OO
away	OO
with	OO
something	OO
valuable	.O
that	OU
is	OO
our	OO
goal	OO
ultimately	OO
over	OO
time	,O
but	OO
that's	OO
going	OO
to	OO
take	OO
some	OO
time	.O
ca:	OU
you	OU
come	OO
over	OO
to	OO
many	,O
i	OU
think	OO
to	OO
me	,O
as	OO
this	OO
enigma	.O
this	OU
is	OO
possibly	OO
unfair	,O
but	OO
i	OU
woke	OO
up	OO
the	OO
other	OO
night	OO
with	OO
this	OO
picture	OO
of	OO
how	OO
i	OU
found	OO
i	OU
was	OO
thinking	OO
about	OO
you	OO
and	OO
the	OO
situation	,O
that	OO
we're	OO
on	OO
this	OO
great	OO
voyage	OO
with	OO
you	OO
on	OO
this	OO
ship	OO
called	OO
the	OO
twittanic	OU
—	OO
and	OO
there	OO
are	OO
people	OO
on	OO
board	OO
in	OO
steerage	OO
who	OO
are	OO
expressing	OO
discomfort	,O
and	OO
you	,O
unlike	OO
many	OO
other	OO
captains	,O
are	OO
saying	,O
well	,U
tell	OO
me	,O
talk	OO
to	OO
me	,O
listen	OO
to	OO
me	,O
i	OU
want	OO
to	OO
hear	.O
and	OU
they	OO
talk	OO
to	OO
you	,O
and	OO
they	OO
say	,O
we're	OU
worried	OO
about	OO
the	OO
iceberg	OO
ahead	.O
and	OU
you	OO
go	,O
you	OU
know	,O
that	OO
is	OO
a	OO
powerful	OO
point	,O
and	OO
our	OO
ship	,O
frankly	,O
hasn't	OO
been	OO
built	OO
properly	OO
for	OO
steering	OO
as	OO
well	OO
as	OO
it	OO
might	.O
and	OU
we	OO
say	,O
please	OU
do	OO
something	.O
and	OU
you	OO
go	OO
to	OO
the	OO
bridge	,O
and	OO
we're	OO
waiting	,O
and	OO
we	OO
look	,O
and	OO
then	OO
you're	OO
showing	OO
this	OO
extraordinary	OO
calm	,O
but	OO
we're	OO
all	OO
standing	OO
outside	,O
saying	,O
jack	,U
turn	OO
the	OO
fucking	OO
wheel	.O
you	OU
know	?O
i	OU
mean	OO
—	OO
it's	OU
democracy	OO
at	OO
stake	.O
it's	OU
our	OO
culture	OO
at	OO
stake	.O
it's	OU
our	OO
world	OO
at	OO
stake	.O
and	OU
twitter	OU
is	OO
amazing	OO
and	OO
shapes	OO
so	OO
much	.O
it's	OU
not	OO
as	OO
big	OO
as	OO
some	OO
of	OO
the	OO
other	OO
platforms	,O
but	OO
the	OO
people	OO
of	OO
influence	OO
use	OO
it	OO
to	OO
set	OO
the	OO
agenda	,O
and	OO
it's	OO
just	OO
hard	OO
to	OO
imagine	OO
a	OO
more	OO
important	OO
role	OO
in	OO
the	OO
world	OO
than	OO
to	.O
i	OU
mean	,O
you're	OO
doing	OO
a	OO
brilliant	OO
job	OO
of	OO
listening	,O
jack	,U
and	OO
hearing	OO
people	,O
but	OO
to	OO
actually	OO
dial	OO
up	OO
the	OO
urgency	OO
and	OO
move	OO
on	OO
this	OO
stuff	OO
—	OO
will	OO
you	OO
do	OO
that	?O
jd:	OU
yes	,U
and	OO
we	OO
have	OO
been	OO
moving	OO
substantially	.O
i	OU
mean	,O
there's	OO
been	OO
a	OO
few	OO
dynamics	OO
in	OO
twitter's	OU
history	.O
one	,U
when	OO
i	OU
came	OO
back	OO
to	OO
the	OO
company	,O
we	OO
were	OO
in	OO
a	OO
pretty	OO
dire	OO
state	OO
in	OO
terms	OO
of	OO
our	OO
future	,O
and	OO
not	OO
just	OO
from	OO
how	OO
people	OO
were	OO
using	OO
the	OO
platform	,O
but	OO
from	OO
a	OO
corporate	OO
narrative	OO
as	OO
well	.O
so	OU
we	OO
had	OO
to	OO
fix	OO
a	OO
bunch	OO
of	OO
the	OO
foundation	,O
turn	OO
the	OO
company	OO
around	,O
go	OO
through	OO
two	OO
crazy	OO
layoffs	,O
because	OO
we	OO
just	OO
got	OO
too	OO
big	OO
for	OO
what	OO
we	OO
were	OO
doing	,O
and	OO
we	OO
focused	OO
all	OO
of	OO
our	OO
energy	OO
on	OO
this	OO
concept	OO
of	OO
serving	OO
the	OO
public	OO
conversation	.O
and	OU
that	OO
took	OO
some	OO
work	.O
and	OU
as	OO
we	OO
dived	OO
into	OO
that	,O
we	OO
realized	OO
some	OO
of	OO
the	OO
issues	OO
with	OO
the	OO
fundamentals	.O
we	OU
could	OO
do	OO
a	OO
bunch	OO
of	OO
superficial	OO
things	OO
to	OO
address	OO
what	OO
you're	OO
talking	OO
about	,O
but	OO
we	OO
need	OO
the	OO
changes	OO
to	OO
last	,O
and	OO
that	OO
means	OO
going	OO
really	,O
really	OO
deep	OO
and	OO
paying	OO
attention	OO
to	OO
what	OO
we	OO
started	OO
13	OO
years	OO
ago	OO
and	OO
really	OO
questioning	OO
how	OO
the	OO
system	OO
works	OO
and	OO
how	OO
the	OO
framework	OO
works	OO
and	OO
what	OO
is	OO
needed	OO
for	OO
the	OO
world	OO
today	,O
given	OO
how	OO
quickly	OO
everything	OO
is	OO
moving	OO
and	OO
how	OO
people	OO
are	OO
using	OO
it	.O
so	OU
we	OO
are	OO
working	OO
as	OO
quickly	OO
as	OO
we	OO
can	,O
but	OO
quickness	OO
will	OO
not	OO
get	OO
the	OO
job	OO
done	.O
it's	OU
focus	,O
it's	OO
prioritization	,O
it's	OO
understanding	OO
the	OO
fundamentals	OO
of	OO
the	OO
network	OO
and	OO
building	OO
a	OO
framework	OO
that	OO
scales	OO
and	OO
that	OO
is	OO
resilient	OO
to	OO
change	,O
and	OO
being	OO
open	OO
about	OO
where	OO
we	OO
are	OO
and	OO
being	OO
transparent	OO
about	OO
where	OO
are	OO
so	OO
that	OO
we	OO
can	OO
continue	OO
to	OO
earn	OO
trust	.O
so	OU
i'm	OU
proud	OO
of	OO
all	OO
the	OO
frameworks	OO
that	OO
we've	OO
put	OO
in	OO
place	.O
i'm	OU
proud	OO
of	OO
our	OO
direction	.O
we	OU
obviously	OO
can	OO
move	OO
faster	,O
but	OO
that	OO
required	OO
just	OO
stopping	OO
a	OO
bunch	OO
of	OO
stupid	OO
stuff	OO
we	OO
were	OO
doing	OO
in	OO
the	OO
past	.O
ca:	OU
all	OU
right	.O
well	,U
i	OU
suspect	OO
there	OO

if	OO

your	OO

vancouver	.U
such	OU
a	OO
treat	OO
to	OO

you	.O
so	,U
talk	OO
us	OO
through	OO
how	OO
do	OO
you	OO
get	OO
from	OO
einstein's	OU
equation	OO
to	OO
a	OO
black	OO
hole	?O
sheperd	OU
doeleman:	OU
over	OU
100	OO
years	OO
ago	,O
einstein	OU
came	OO
up	OO
with	OO
this	OO
geometric	OO
theory	OO
of	OO
gravity	OO
which	OO
deforms	OO
space	OO
time	.O
so	,U
matter	OO
deforms	OO
space	OO
time	,O
and	OO
then	OO
space	OO
time	OO
tells	OO
matter	OO
in	OO
turn	OO
how	OO
to	OO
move	OO
around	OO
it	.O
and	OU
you	OO
can	OO
get	OO
enough	OO
matter	OO
into	OO
a	OO
small	OO
enough	OO
region	OO
that	OO
it	OO
punctures	OO
space	OO
time	,O
and	OO
that	OO
even	OO
light	OO
can't	OO
escape	,O
the	OO
force	OO
of	OO
gravity	OO
keeps	OO
even	OO
light	OO
inside	.O
ca:	OU
and	OU
so	,O
before	OO
that	,O
the	OO
reason	OO
the	OO
earth	OU
moves	OO
around	OO
the	OO
sun	OU
is	OO
not	OO
because	OO
the	OO
sun	OU
is	OO
pulling	OO
the	OO
earth	OU
as	OO
we	OO
think	,O
but	OO
it's	OO
literally	OO
changed	OO
the	OO
shape	OO
of	OO
space	OO
so	OO
that	OO
we	OO
just	OO
sort	OO
of	OO
fall	OO
around	OO
the	OO
sun	.U
sd:	OU
exactly	,U
the	OO
geometry	OO
of	OO
space	OO
time	OO
tells	OO
the	OO
earth	OU
how	OO
to	OO
move	OO
around	OO
the	OO
sun	.U
you're	OU
almost	OO
seeing	OO
a	OO
black	OO
hole	OO
puncture	OO
through	OO
space	OO
time	,O
and	OO
when	OO
it	OO
goes	OO
so	OO
deeply	OO
in	,O
then	OO
there's	OO
a	OO
point	OO
at	OO
which	OO
light	OO
orbits	OO
the	OO
black	OO
hole	.O
ca:	OU
and	OU
so	OO
that's	,O
i	OU
guess	,O
is	OO
what's	OO
happening	OO
here	.O
this	OU
is	OO
not	OO
an	OO

this	OO

a	OO
computer	OO

the	OO

we	OO

this	OO
in	OO

but	OO
even	OO
here	OO
you	OO
see	OO
this	OO
ring	OO
of	OO
light	,O
which	OO
is	OO
the	OO
orbit	OO
of	OO
photons	.O
that's	OU
where	OO
photons	OO
literally	OO
move	OO
around	OO
the	OO
black	OO
hole	,O
and	OO
around	OO
that	OO
is	OO
this	OO
hot	OO
gas	OO
that's	OO
drawn	OO
to	OO
the	OO
black	OO
hole	,O
and	OO
it's	OO
hot	OO
because	OO
of	OO

all	OU
this	OO
gas	OO
is	OO
trying	OO
to	OO
get	OO

up	.O
ca:	OU

a	OO

you	OO
would	OO
need	OO
to	OO
build	OO
a	OO
telescope	OO
as	OO
large	OO
as	OO
the	OO
earth	,U
because	OO
the	OO

the	OO

we	OO

they	OO
received	OO
the	OO
light	OO

from	OO

then	OO
we	OO
stitched	OO
all	OO

together	OO
to	OO
make	OO
an	OO

to	OO

in	OO

sometimes	,O
it's	OO
better	OO
to	OO

in	OU
this	OO

we	OO
were	OO
both	,O

the	OU

you	OO

ca:	OU
it's	OU
a	OO

a	OO
few	OO

a	OO
few	OO

on	OO
a	OO

this	OU

sd:	OU
well	,U
it	OO
took	OO
a	OO
long	OO

ca:	OU
i	OU

look	OO
at	OO
this	.O
that	OU

it	.O
that	OU
was	OO
the	OO

what	OO
we're	OO
really	OO
looking	OO
at	OO
there	.O
sd:	OU
i	OU
still	OO
love	OO
it	.O
so	OU
what	OO
you're	OO
seeing	OO
is	OO
that	OO
last	OO

of	OO

you're	OU
seeing	OO
einstein's	OU
geometry	OO
laid	OO

the	OU

in	OO
space	OO
time	OO
is	OO
so	OO
deep	OO
that	OO

moves	OO
around	OO
in	OO

so	OO
that	OO
light	OO
behind	OO
the	OO

as	OO
i	OU
think	OO
we'll	OO
see	OO
soon	,O

to	OO
us	OO
on	OO
these	OO
parallel	OO

at	OO
exactly	OO
that	OO
orbit	.O
it	OU
turns	OO
out	,O
that	OO
orbit	OO
is	OO
the	OO
square	OO

of	OO
27	OO
times	OO
just	OO
a	OO
handful	OO
of	OO
fundamental	OO
constants	.O
it's	OU
extraordinary	OO
when	OO
you	OO
think	OO
about	OO
it	.O
ca:	OU
when	.U
in	OU
my	OO
head	,O
initially	,O
when	OO
i	OU
thought	OO
of	OO

i'm	OU
thinking	OO
that	OO

the	OO

there's	OO
lots	OO
of	OO

and	OO
light	OO
whirling	OO
around	OO
in	OO
that	OO
shape	.O
but	OU
it's	OO
actually	OO
more	OO
complicated	OO
than	OO
that	.O
well	,U
talk	OO
us	OO
through	OO
this	OO
animation	,O
because	OO
it's	OO
light	OO
being	OO
lensed	OO
around	OO
it	.O
sd:	OU
you'll	OU
see	OO
here	OO
that	OO
some	OO
light	OO
from	OO
behind	OO
it	OO
gets	OO
lensed	,O
and	OO
some	OO
light	OO
does	OO
a	OO
loop	OO
the	OO
loop	OO
around	OO
the	OO
entire	OO
orbit	OO
of	OO
the	OO
black	OO
hole	.O
but	OU
when	OO
you	OO
get	OO
enough	OO
light	OO
from	OO
all	OO
this	OO
hot	OO
gas	OO
swirling	OO
around	OO
the	OO
black	OO
hole	,O
then	OO
you	OO
wind	OO
up	OO

you	OO

and	OU
you	OO
see	OO
the	OO

of	OO
this	OO

begin	OO
to	OO
come	OO
into	OO

and	OU
that's	OO
what	OO
einstein	OU
predicted	OO
over	OO
100	OO
years	OO

ca:	OU
yeah	,U
that	OO
is	OO
amazing	.O
so	OU
tell	OO
us	OO
more	OO
about	OO
what	OO
we're	OO

looking	OO
at	OO

of	OO
all	,O
why	OO

brighter	OO

sd:	OU
so	OU
what's	OO
happening	OO
is	OO
that	OO
the	OO
black	OO

is	OO
spinning	.O
and	OU
you	OO
wind	OO
up	OO
with	OO
some	OO

we're	OO

it's	OU

it's	OO
weirdly	OO

at	OO

you	OO

sd:	OU
black	OU

are	OO
the	OO

because	OO
that's	OO
where	OO
the	OO

come	OO
together	.O
what's	OU

a	OO
singularity	.O
and	OU
that's	OO
where	OO
all	OO
the	OO

become	OO
unified	,O
because	OO
gravity	OO
finally	OO
is	OO
strong	OO
enough	OO
to	OO

it's	OO

from	OO
us	,O
the	OO
universe	OO
has	OO
cloaked	OO
it	OO
in	OO
the	OO

so	OU
we	OO
don't	OO
know	OO
what	OO
happens	OO

so	OU
there's	OO
a	OO
smaller	OO
one	OO
of	OO

can	OU
we	OO
go	OO

this	OU

the	OO

this	OO

somewhere	OO
in	OO

there's	OO

one	,O
which	OO
you're	OO
trying	OO

sd:	OU
we	OU
already	OO

it's	OO
there	,O
and	OO
we've	OO
already	OO
taken	OO

on	OO
it	.O
and	OU
we're	OO
working	OO
on	OO
those	OO

we	OO
hope	OO

something	OO

it's	OU

also	OO
a	OO

maybe	OO
the	OO
similar	OO

of	OO

to	OO
what	OO
we	OO

right	.U
so	OU
it	OO
turns	OO
out	OO
that	OO
the	OO
black	OO

in	OO
m87	,U
that	OO
we	OO
saw	OO
before	,O
is	OO
six	OO
and	OO
a	OO
half	OO

but	OU
it's	OO
so	OO
far	OO
away	OO
that	OO
it	OO
appears	OO
a	OO
certain	OO
size	.O
the	OU
black	OO
hole	OO
in	OO
the	OO
center	OO
of	OO
our	OO

is	OO
a	OO

less	OO
massive	,O

also	OO
a	OO

so	OU
it	OO
looks	OO
the	OO

on	OO
the	OO

ca:	OU
finally	,U
i	OU

a	OO

to	OO
a	OO
remarkable	OO

i	OU

until	OO

about	OO
epcs	OU
years	OO
later	,O
after	OO
all	OO
the	OO
science	OO
news	OO
broke	OO
while	OO
i	OU
was	OO
in	OO
graduate	OO

as	OO
we	OO
were	OO
taking	OO
a	OO

talking	OO
about	OO

mating	OO

this	OO

up	.O

as	OO
my	OO

going	OO
through	OO
the	OO

recounting	OO
all	OO
the	OO

of	OO

that	OO

these	OO

i'm	OU
sitting	OO
in	OO

and	OO
a	OO
familiar	OO
song	OO
starts	OO
bopping	OO
in	OO
my	OO
head	.O
i'm	OU
like	,O
you	OU
down	OO
with	OO
opp	?U
yeah	,U
you	OO
know	OO
me	.O
i	OU
mean	,O
that's	OO
exactly	OO
what	OO
that	OO
song	OO
was	OO
about:	OO
epcs	.U
and	OU
what	OO
i	OU
recognized	OO
is	OO
that	OO
this	OO
gives	OO
us	OO
an	OO
opportunity	OO
to	OO
revisit	OO
this	OO
song	.O
let's	OU
switch	OO
the	OO
lyrics	OO
up	.O
so	OU
say	OO
epc	.U
audience:	OU
epc	.U
dnl:	OU
say	OU
it	,O
epc	.U
audience:	OU
epc	.U
i	OU
like	OO
to	OO
say	OO
it	OO
with	OO
pride	OO
now	,O
when	OO
you	OO
do	OO
it	,O
do	OO
it	OO
well	,O
and	OO
make	OO
sure	OO
that	OO
it	OO
counts	.O
you're	OU
not	OO
down	OO
with	OO
a	OO
discount	.O
you	OU
down	OO
with	OO
epc	?U
audience:	OU
yeah	,U
you	OO
know	OO
me	.O
now	,U
i	OU
had	OO
always	OO
been	OO
playing	OO
songs	OO
in	OO
my	OO
head	OO
while	OO
i	OU
was	OO
in	OO
science	OO
class	,O
kind	OO
of	OO
tapping	OO
into	OO
this	OO
index	OO
of	OO
pop	OO
culture	OO
and	OO
hip	OO
hop	OO
songs	.O
but	OU
when	OO
i	OU
would	OO
share	OO
my	OO
analogies	OO
with	OO
my	OO
science	OO
professors	,O
all	OO
of	OO
whom	OO
were	OO
older	OO
white	OO
men	,O
i	OU
often	OO
got	OO
blank	OO
and	OO
confused	OO
stares	OO
as	OO
responses	.O
but	OU
when	OO
i	OU
would	OO
share	OO
this	OO
with	OO
people	OO
from	OO
communities	OO
like	OO
mine	,O
or	OO
other	OO
colleagues	OO
—	OO
so	,O
diverse	OO
communities	OO
—	OO
this	OO
hip	OO
hop	OO
science	OO
remix	OO
was	OO
a	OO
hit	.O
that's	OU
because	OO
i	OU
was	OO
either	OO
talking	OO
to	OO
people	OO
who	OO
looked	OO
and	OO
sounded	OO
like	OO
me	,O
or	OO
at	OO
the	OO
very	OO
least	,O
you	OO
know	,O
listened	OO
to	OO
some	OO
of	OO
the	OO
same	OO
songs	.O
we	OU
were	OO
sharing	OO
a	OO
common	OO
cultural	OO
lexicon	.O
and	OU
with	OO
that	OO
lexicon	,O
i	OU
was	OO
able	OO
to	OO
bring	OO
new	OO
science	OO
terms	OO
to	OO
them	,O
and	OO
together	,O
we	OO
were	OO
sharing	OO
a	OO
new	OO
comprehension	OO
of	OO
science	OO
for	OO
the	OO
culture	.O
now	,U
hip	OO
hop	OO
song	OO
references	OO
are	OO
a	OO
really	OO
good	OO
tool	OO
for	OO
teaching	OO
content	OO
to	OO
students	OO
from	OO
hip	OO
hop	OO
culture	OO
or	OO
urban	OO
communities	.O
and	OU
i	OU
use	OO
it	OO
intentionally	OO
to	OO
connect	OO
to	OO
those	OO
students	,O
tapping	OO
into	OO
vocabulary	OO
that	OO
they	OO
already	OO
know	OO
and	OO
systems	OO
that	OO
they	OO
already	OO
comprehend	.O
and	OU
what	OO
it	OO
does	OO
in	OO
that	OO
process	OO
is	OO
it	OO
ratifies	OO
them	,O
us	,O
our	OO
culture	OO
as	OO
knowledge	OO
purveyors	.O
i	OU
use	OO
hip	OO
hop	OO
to	OO
frame	OO
and	OO
communicate	OO
science	OO
because	OO
i'm	OU
intentionally	OO
communicating	OO
science	OO
to	OO

audiences	OO
that	OO
public	OO

that	OO

in	OO
the	OO

all	OU
the	OO

you	.O
so	OU
for	OO
the	OO

12	OO
years	,O
i've	OU
been	OO
obsessed	OO
with	OO
this	OO
idea	OO
that	OO
climate	OO

is	OO
an	OO
information	OO
issue	OO
that	OO
computers	OO
will	OO
help	OO
us	OO
fight	.O
i	OU
went	OO
from	OO
data	OO
science	OO
to	OO
climate	OO
policy	OO
research	,O
from	OO
tech	OO
to	OO
public	OO
service	,O
in	OO
pursuit	OO
of	OO
better	OO
data	OO
to	OO
avoid	OO
the	OO
wasted	OO
energy	,O
resources	,O
opportunities	OO
that	OO
lead	OO
to	OO
runaway	OO
carbon	OO
emissions	.O
until	OU
one	OO
day	,O
running	OO
in	OO
the	OO
streets	OO
with	OO
a	OO
friend	,O
it	OO
hit	OO
me:	OO
the	OO
same	OO
cars	,O
factories	,O
power	OO
plants	OO
whose	OO
emissions	OO
are	OO
wrecking	OO
our	OO
climate	OO
over	OO
time	OO
also	OO
release	OO
harmful	,O
local	OO
pollutants	OO
that	OO
threaten	OO
our	OO
health	OO
right	OO
here	OO
and	OO
right	OO
now	.O
all	OU
this	OO
time	OO
i'd	OU
focused	OO
on	OO
the	OO
long	OO
term	OO
environmental	OO
risk	OO
when	OO
i	OU
should	OO
have	OO
been	OO
up	OO
in	OO
arms	OO
about	OO
the	OO
immediate	OO
health	OO
impact	OO
of	OO
pollutants	OO
in	OO
the	OO
air	.O
air	OU
pollution	OO
is	OO
a	OO
burning	OO
public	OO
health	OO
crisis	.O
it	OU
kills	OO
seven	OO
million	OO
people	OO
every	OO
year	,O
it	OO
costs	OO
five	OO
trillion	OO
dollars	OO
to	OO
the	OO
world	OO
economy	OO
and	,O
worst	,O
it	OO
robs	OO
us	OO
of	OO
our	OO
most	OO
precious	OO
gift	,O
the	OO
years	OO
in	OO
our	OO
lives:	OO
six	OO
months	OO
of	OO
life	OO
expectancy	OO
in	OO
my	OO
hometown	OO
of	OO
paris	OU
and	OO
up	OO
to	OO
three	,O
four	,O
five	OO
years	OO
in	OO
parts	OO
of	OO
india	OU
and	OO
china	.U
and	OU
in	OO
the	OO
us	,U
more	OO
people	OO
die	OO
from	OO
car	OO
exhaust	OO
than	OO
from	OO
car	OO
accidents	.O
so	OU
how	OO
do	OO
we	OO
protect	OO
ourselves	OO
from	OO
pollution	?O
the	OU
reason	OO
it's	OO
difficult	OO
is	OO
an	OO
information	OO
gap	.O
we	OU
simply	OO
lack	OO
the	OO
data	OO
to	OO
understand	OO
our	OO
exposure	.O
and	OU
that's	OO
because	OO
the	OO
way	OO
we	OO
monitor	OO
air	OO
quality	OO
today	OO
is	OO
designed	OO
not	OO
to	OO
help	OO
people	OO
breathe	OO
but	OO
to	OO
help	OO
governments	OO
govern	.O
most	OU
major	OO
cities	OO
operate	OO
networks	OO
of	OO
air	OO
quality	OO
monitoring	OO
stations	OO
like	OO
this	OO
one	OO
in	OO
london	,U
to	OO
decide	OO
when	OO
to	OO
cut	OO
traffic	OO
or	OO
when	OO
to	OO
shut	OO
down	OO
factories	.O
and	OU
these	OO
machines	OO
are	OO
like	OO
the	OO
computers	OO
from	OO
the	OO
'60s	OO
that	OO
filled	OO
entire	OO
rooms	.O
they're	OU
incredibly	OO
precise	OO
but	OO
incredibly	OO
large	,O
heavy	,O
costly	OO
—	OO
so	OO
much	OO
that	OO
you	OO
can	OO
only	OO
deploy	OO
just	OO
a	OO
few	OO
of	OO
them	,O
and	OO
they	OO
cannot	OO
move	.O
so	OU
to	OO
governments	,O
air	OO
pollution	OO
looks	OO
like	OO
this	.O
but	OU
for	OO
the	OO
rest	OO
of	OO
us	,O
air	OO
quality	OO
looks	OO
like	OO
this	.O
it	OU
changes	OO
all	OO
the	OO
time:	OO
hour	OO
by	OO
hour	,O
street	OO
by	OO
street	,O
up	OO
to	OO
eight	OO
times	OO
within	OO
a	OO
single	OO
city	OO
block	.O
and	OU
even	OO
more	OO
from	OO
indoor	OO
to	OO
outdoor	.O
so	OU
unless	OO
you	OO
happen	OO
to	OO
be	OO
walking	OO
right	OO
next	OO
to	OO
one	OO
of	OO
those	OO
stations	,O
they	OO
just	OO
cannot	OO
tell	OO
you	OO
what	OO
you	OO
breathe	.O
so	OU
what	OO
would	OO
environmental	OO
protection	OO
look	OO
like	OO
if	OO
it	OO
was	OO
designed	OO
for	OO
the	OO
age	OO
of	OO
the	OO
smartphone	?O
so	OU
for	OO
the	OO
past	OO
three	OO
years	,O
my	OO
team	OO
and	OO
i	OU
have	OO
been	OO
building	OO
a	OO
technology	OO
that	OO
helps	OO
you	OO
know	OO
what	OO
you	OO
breathe	OO
and	OO
fits	OO
in	OO
your	OO
hand	.O
flow	OU
is	OO
a	OO
personal	OO
air	OO
quality	OO
tracker	OO
that	OO
you	OO
can	OO
wear	OO
with	OO
you	OO
on	OO
a	OO
backpack	,O
a	OO
bike	,O
a	OO
stroller	.O
it's	OU
packed	OO
with	OO
miniature	OO
sensors	OO
that	OO
monitor	OO
the	OO
most	OO
important	OO
pollutants	OO
in	OO
the	OO
air	OO
around	OO
you	,O
like	OO
nitrogen	OO
oxides	,O
the	OO
exhaust	OO
gas	OO
from	OO
cars	,O
or	OO
particulate	OO
matter	OO
that	OO
gets	OO
into	OO
your	OO
bloodstream	OO
and	OO
creates	OO
strokes	OO
and	OO
heart	OO
issues	.O
or	OU
volatile	OO
organic	OO
compounds	,O
the	OO
thousands	OO
of	OO
chemicals	OO
in	OO
everyday	OO
products	OO
that	OO
we	OO
end	OO
up	OO
breathing	.O
and	OU
that	OO
makes	OO
this	OO
data	OO
actionable	OO
and	OO
helps	OO
you	OO
understand	OO
what	OO
you're	OO
breathing	OO
by	OO
telling	OO
you	OO
where	OO
and	OO
when	OO
you've	OO
been	OO
exposed	OO
to	OO
poor	OO
air	OO
quality	,O
and	OO
that	OO
way	OO
you	OO
can	OO
make	OO
informed	OO
decisions	OO
to	OO
take	OO
action	OO
against	OO
pollution	.O
you	OU
can	OO
change	OO
the	OO
products	OO
you	OO
use	OO
at	OO
home	,O
you	OO
can	OO
find	OO
the	OO
best	OO
route	OO
to	OO
cycle	OO
to	OO
work	,O
you	OO
can	OO
run	OO
when	OO
pollution	OO
is	OO
not	OO
peaking	OO
and	OO
you	OO
can	OO
find	OO
the	OO
best	OO
park	OO
to	OO
bring	OO
your	OO
children	OO
out	.O
over	OU
time	OO
you	OO
build	OO
better	OO
habits	OO
to	OO
decrease	OO
your	OO
exposure	OO
to	OO
pollution	,O
and	OO
by	OO
tracking	OO
air	OO
quality	OO
around	OO
them	,O
cyclists	,O
commuters	,O
parents	OO
will	OO
also	OO
contribute	OO
to	OO
mapping	OO
air	OO
quality	OO
in	OO
their	OO
city	.O
so	OU
we're	OO
building	OO
more	OO
than	OO
a	OO
device	,O
but	OO
a	OO
community	.O
and	OU
last	OO
summer	,O
we	OO
sent	OO
early	OO
prototypes	OO
of	OO
our	OO
technology	OO
to	OO
100	OO
volunteers	OO
in	OO
london	,U
and	OO
together	OO
they	OO
mapped	OO
air	OO
quality	OO
across	OO
1,000	OO
miles	OO
of	OO
sidewalk	OO
and	OO
20	OO
percent	OO
of	OO
all	OO
of	OO
central	OO
london	.U
so	OU
our	OO
goal	OO
now	OO
is	OO
to	OO
scale	OO
this	OO
work	OO
around	OO
the	OO
world	,O
to	OO
crowdsource	OO
data	OO
so	OO
we	OO
can	OO
map	OO
air	OO
quality	OO
on	OO
every	OO
street	,O
to	OO
build	OO
an	OO
unprecedented	OO
database	OO
so	OO
scientists	OO
can	OO
research	OO
pollution	,O
and	OO
to	OO
empower	OO
citizens	,O
civic	OO
leaders	,O
policy	OO
makers	OO
to	OO
support	OO
clean	OO
air	OO
policies	OO
for	OO
change	.O
because	OU
this	OO
can	OO
and	OO
must	OO
change	.O
remember	OU
cigarettes	OO
in	OO
bars	?O
it	OU
took	OO
decades	OO
of	OO
lung	OO
cancer	OO
research	OO
and	OO
second	OO
hand	OO
smoking	OO
studies	,O
but	OO
eventually	,O
we	OO
reached	OO
a	OO
tipping	OO
point	OO
and	OO
we	OO
passed	OO
smoking	OO
ban	OO
laws	.O
we	OU
must	OO
reach	OO
the	OO
same	OO
tipping	OO
point	OO
for	OO
air	OO
quality	OO
and	OO
i	OU
believe	OO
we	OO
will	.O
in	OU
the	OO
past	OO
couple	OO
years	OO
alone	,O
governments	OO
have	OO
fined	OO
carmakers	OO
record	OO
amounts	OO
for	OO
cheating	OO
on	OO
emission	OO
standards	.O
cities	OU
have	OO
passed	OO
congestion	OO
charges	OO
or	OO
built	OO
bike	OO
lanes	OO
—	OO
like	OO
paris	OU
that	OO
turned	OO
this	OO
highway	,O
right	OO
next	OO
to	OO
my	OO
home	,O
in	OO
the	OO
middle	OO
of	OO
the	OO
city	,O
into	OO
a	OO
waterfront	OO
park	.O
and	OU
now	OO
mayors	OO
around	OO
the	OO
world	OO
are	OO
thinking	OO
of	OO
banning	OO
diesel	OO
outright	OO
by	OO
2025	,O
2030	,O
2035	.O
but	OU
how	OO
much	OO
faster	OO
could	OO
we	OO
go	,O
how	OO
many	OO
lives	OO
could	OO
we	OO
save	?O
technology	OU
alone	OO
will	OO
not	OO
solve	OO
climate	OO
change	,O
nor	OO
will	OO
it	OO
make	OO
air	OO
pollution	OO
disappear	OO
overnight	.O
but	OU
it	OO
can	OO
make	OO
the	OO
quality	OO
of	OO
our	OO
air	OO
much	OO
more	OO
transparent	,O
and	OO
if	OO
we	OO
can	OO
empower	OO
people	OO
to	OO
take	OO
action	OO
to	OO
improve	OO
their	OO
own	OO
health	,O
then	OO
together	OO
we	OO
can	OO
act	OO
to	OO
bring	OO
an	OO
end	OO
to	OO
our	OO
pollution	.O
thank	OU
you	OO
very	OO
much	.O
i	OU
have	OO
a	OO

for	OO
each	OO
one	OO
of	OO
you	,O

the	OO
vision	OO
i	OU

that	OO
when	OO

your	OO

singing	OO
at	OO
the	OO

of	OO

who	OO
you	OO
are	OO
and	OO
doing	OO
what	OO
you	OO
do;	OO
that	OO
as	OO
you	OO
go	OO
through	OO
the	OO

you	OO

in	OO
gratitude	OO
at	OO
the	OO
tremendous	OO

you;	OO
that	OO
as	OO
you	OO
go	OO
through	OO
the	OO

you	OO
become	OO
radiantly	OO

several	OO

if	OO
your	OO

what	OO

we're	OU

a	OO

on	OO
this	.O
what	OU
do	OO
you	OO
have	OO
to	OO

in	OO

to	OO
be	OO

anybody	,U
quick	?O
when	OU
i	OU

this	OO

a	OO

of	OO

up:	OO
vast	OO

good	OO

lots	OO
of	OO

etc	.O
right	OU
now	,O
if	OO
you	OO

about	OO
it	,O
you	OO
probably	OO
have	OO
a	OO
list	OO

here's	OU
what	OO
i	OU
need	OO
to	OO
get	OO
in	OO

i	OU
would	OO

that	OO
—	OO
anything	OO
you	OO
can	OO
get	,O
you	OO
can	OO
un	OO
get	.O
is	OU
that	OO

so	,U
vast	OO
wealth	OO

make	OO
you	OO

tomorrow	.O
a	OU

so	OU
whatever	OO
you	OO

that	OO

make	OO
you	OO

can	OO
go	OO
away	.O
where	OU
does	OO
that	OO
leave	OO
you	?O
not	OU
a	OO
very	OO
nice	OO
place	,O
right	?O
i	OU
have	OO
a	OO

proposition	OO
to	OO
suggest	OO
to	OO
you	.O
what	OU
i	OU
have	OO
to	OO
suggest	OO
to	OO
you	OO
is	OO
that	OO
there	OO

nothing	OO
that	OO
you	OO

in	OU

you	OU

now	,U
all	OO

my	OO

and	OU
the	OO
answer	OO
to	OO
that	OO
is	OO
actually	OO
very	OO
simple	.O
you	OU

your	OO

to	OO
be	OO

and	OU
the	OO
way	OO
we	OO

is	OO
by	OO

a	OU

the	OU

a	OO

you	OU

a	OO

off	OO

you	OU

that's	OU
a	OO

but	OO
the	OO
tree	OO
in	OO
the	OO

too	OO
many	OO

so	OU
if	OO
you	OO

a	OO

and	OO
20	OO

i'd	OU
make	OO
it	OO
ever	OO

oh	OU
no	,O
the	OO

the	OU

the	OO

the	OO

it	OO

your	OO

the	OO

you	OO

it	.O

because	OO

even	OO
now	OO

it	.O
the	OU

you	OO

you're	OO

all	OO
your	OO

to	OO
make	OO
it	OO

you	OU

when	OO
you're	OO

it	,O
you're	OO

what	OO

a	OO
c	.U
perhaps	OU
until	OO
now	.O
because	OU
my	OO

recently	OO
succeeded	OO
in	OO
developing	OO
such	OO
a	OO
capability	,O
which	OO
we	OO
call	OO
base	OO
editing	.O
the	OU
story	OO
of	OO
how	OO
we	OO
developed	OO
base	OO
editing	OO
actually	OO
begins	OO
three	OO
billion	OO
years	OO
ago	.O
we	OU
think	OO
of	OO
bacteria	OO
as	OO
sources	OO
of	OO
infection	,O
but	OO
bacteria	OO
themselves	OO
are	OO
also	OO
prone	OO
to	OO
being	OO
infected	,O
in	OO
particular	,O
by	OO
viruses	.O
so	OU
about	OO
three	OO
billion	OO
years	OO
ago	,O
bacteria	OO
evolved	OO
a	OO
defense	OO
mechanism	OO
to	OO
fight	OO
viral	OO
infection	.O
that	OU
defense	OO
mechanism	OO
is	OO
now	OO
better	OO
known	OO
as	OO
crispr	.U
and	OU
the	OO
warhead	OO
in	OO
crispr	OU
is	OO
this	OO
purple	OO
protein	OO
that	OO
acts	OO
like	OO
molecular	OO
scissors	OO
to	OO
cut	OO
dna	,U
breaking	OO
the	OO
double	OO
helix	OO
into	OO
two	OO
pieces	.O
if	OU
crispr	OU
couldn't	OO
distinguish	OO
between	OO
bacterial	OO
and	OO
viral	OO
dna	,U
it	OO
wouldn't	OO
be	OO
a	OO
very	OO
useful	OO
defense	OO
system	.O
but	OU
the	OO
most	OO
amazing	OO
feature	OO
of	OO
crispr	OU
is	OO
that	OO
the	OO
scissors	OO
can	OO
be	OO
programmed	OO
to	OO
search	OO
for	,O
bind	OO
to	OO
and	OO
cut	OO
only	OO
a	OO
specific	OO
dna	OU
sequence	.O
so	OU
when	OO
a	OO
bacterium	OO
encounters	OO
a	OO
virus	OO
for	OO
the	OO
first	OO
time	,O
it	OO
can	OO
store	OO
a	OO
small	OO
snippet	OO
of	OO
that	OO
virus's	OO
dna	OU
for	OO
use	OO
as	OO
a	OO
program	OO
to	OO
direct	OO
the	OO
crispr	OU
scissors	OO
to	OO
cut	OO
that	OO
viral	OO
dna	OU
sequence	OO
during	OO
a	OO
future	OO
infection	.O
cutting	OU
a	OO
virus's	OO
dna	OU
messes	OO
up	OO
the	OO
function	OO
of	OO
the	OO
cut	OO
viral	OO
gene	,O
and	OO
therefore	OO
disrupts	OO
the	OO
virus's	OO
life	OO
cycle	.O
remarkable	OU
researchers	OO
including	OO
emmanuelle	OU
charpentier	,U
george	OU
church	,U
jennifer	OU
doudna	OU
and	OO
feng	OU
zhang	OU
showed	OO
six	OO
years	OO
ago	OO
how	OO
crispr	OU
scissors	OO
could	OO
be	OO
programmed	OO
to	OO
cut	OO
dna	OU
sequences	OO
of	OO
our	OO
choosing	,O
including	OO
sequences	OO
in	OO
your	OO
genome	,O
instead	OO
of	OO
the	OO
viral	OO
dna	OU
sequences	OO
chosen	OO
by	OO
bacteria	.O
but	OU
the	OO
outcomes	OO
are	OO
actually	OO
similar	.O
cutting	OU
a	OO
dna	OU
sequence	OO
in	OO
your	OO
genome	OO
also	OO
disrupts	OO
the	OO
function	OO
of	OO
the	OO
cut	OO
gene	,O
typically	,O
by	OO
causing	OO
the	OO
insertion	OO
and	OO
deletion	OO
of	OO
random	OO
mixtures	OO
of	OO
dna	OU
letters	OO
at	OO
the	OO
cut	OO
site	.O
now	,U
disrupting	OO
genes	OO
can	OO
be	OO
very	OO
useful	OO
for	OO
some	OO
applications	.O
but	OU
for	OO
most	OO
point	OO
mutations	OO
that	OO
cause	OO
genetic	OO
diseases	,O
simply	OO
cutting	OO
the	OO
already	OO
mutated	OO
gene	OO
won't	OO
benefit	OO
patients	,O
because	OO
the	OO
function	OO
of	OO
the	OO
mutated	OO
gene	OO
needs	OO
to	OO
be	OO
restored	,O
not	OO
further	OO
disrupted	.O
so	OU
cutting	OO
this	OO
already	OO
mutated	OO
hemoglobin	OO
gene	OO
that	OO
causes	OO
sickle	OO

won't	OO
restore	OO
the	OO

of	OO

to	OO
make	OO

and	OU
while	OO
we	OO
can	OO
sometimes	OO
introduce	OO

to	OO
replace	OO
the	OO

that	OO

work	OO
in	OO
most	OO

the	OO

like	OU
many	OO

dreamed	OO
of	OO
a	OO

in	OO
which	OO
we	OO
might	OO
be	OO
able	OO
to	OO
treat	OO
or	OO
maybe	OO
even	OO

human	OO
genetic	OO

but	OU
i	OU
saw	OO
the	OO
lack	OO
of	OO
a	OO
way	OO
to	OO
fix	OO
point	OO
mutations	,O
which	OO
cause	OO
most	OO
human	OO
genetic	OO

as	OO
a	OO
major	OO

standing	OO
in	OO
the	OO

being	OU
a	OO

i	OU
began	OO

directly	OO
on	OO
an	OO

to	OO
truly	OO

the	OO

the	OU

instead	OO
of	OO

the	OO

one	OO

to	OO
another	OO

without	OO

the	OO

you	OO

from	OO
a	OO

these	OU

a	OO

the	OU

the	OO

of	OO

this	OU

the	OU
energy	OO

the	OO

from	OO
a	OO

with	OU

the	OO

so	OU
even	OO
if	OO

the	OO

scales	OO
of	OO
motion	OO
that	OO
these	OO
flows	OO
display	.O
turbulent	OU
flows	OO
have	OO
many	OO
differently	OO
sized	OO
whirls	OO
called	OO
eddies	,O
which	OO
are	OO
like	OO
vortices	OO
of	OO
different	OO
sizes	OO
and	OO
shapes	.O
all	OU
those	OO
differently	OO
sized	OO
eddies	OO
interact	OO
with	OO
each	OO
other	,O
breaking	OO
up	OO
to	OO
become	OO
smaller	OO
and	OO
smaller	OO
until	OO
all	OO
that	OO
movement	OO
is	OO
transformed	OO
into	OO
heat	,O
in	OO
a	OO
process	OO
called	OO
the	OO
“energy	OO
cascade	.O
so	OU
that’s	OO
how	OO
we	OO
recognize	OO
turbulence–	OO
but	OO
why	OO
does	OO
it	OO
happen	?O
in	OU
every	OO
flowing	OO
liquid	OO
or	OO
gas	OO
there	OO
are	OO
two	OO
opposing	OO
forces:	OO
inertia	OO
and	OO
viscosity	.O
inertia	OU
is	OO
the	OO
tendency	OO
of	OO
fluids	OO
to	OO
keep	OO
moving	,O
which	OO
causes	OO
instability	.O
viscosity	OU
works	OO
against	OO
disruption	,O
making	OO
the	OO
flow	OO
laminar	OO
instead	.O
in	OU
thick	OO
fluids	OO
such	OO
as	OO
honey	,O
viscosity	OO
almost	OO
always	OO
wins	.O
less	OU
viscous	OO
substances	OO
like	OO
water	OO
or	OO
air	OO
are	OO
more	OO
prone	OO
to	OO
inertia	,O
which	OO
creates	OO
instabilities	OO
that	OO
develop	OO
into	OO
turbulence	.O
we	OU
measure	OO
where	OO
a	OO
flow	OO
falls	OO
on	OO
that	OO
spectrum	OO
with	OO
something	OO
called	OO
the	OO
reynolds	OU
number	,O
which	OO
is	OO
the	OO
ratio	OO
between	OO
a	OO
flow’s	OO
inertia	OO
and	OO
its	OO
viscosity	.O
the	OU
higher	OO
the	OO
reynolds	OU
number	,O
the	OO
more	OO
likely	OO
it	OO
is	OO
that	OO
turbulence	OO
will	OO
occur	.O
honey	OU
being	OO
poured	OO
into	OO
a	OO
cup	,O
for	OO
example	,O
has	OO
a	OO
reynolds	OU
number	OO
of	OO
about	OO
1	.O
the	OU
same	OO
set	OO
up	OO
with	OO
water	OO
has	OO
a	OO
reynolds	OU
number	OO
that’s	OO
closer	OO
to	OO
10,000	.O
the	OU
reynolds	OU
number	OO
is	OO
useful	OO
for	OO
understanding	OO
simple	OO
scenarios	,O
but	OO
it’s	OO
ineffective	OO
in	OO
many	OO
situations	.O
for	OU
example	,O
the	OO
motion	OO
of	OO
the	OO
atmosphere	OO
is	OO
significantly	OO
influenced	OO
by	OO
factors	OO
including	OO
gravity	OO
and	OO
the	OO
earth’s	OO
rotation	.O
or	OU
take	OO
relatively	OO
simple	OO
things	OO
like	OO
the	OO
drag	OO
on	OO
buildings	OO
and	OO
cars	.O
we	OU
can	OO
model	OO
those	OO
thanks	OO
to	OO
many	OO
experiments	OO
and	OO
empirical	OO
evidence	.O
but	OU
physicists	OO
want	OO
to	OO
be	OO
able	OO
to	OO
predict	OO
them	OO
through	OO
physical	OO
laws	OO
and	OO
equations	OO
as	OO
well	OO
as	OO
we	OO
can	OO
model	OO
the	OO
orbits	OO
of	OO
planets	OO
or	OO
electromagnetic	OO
fields	.O
most	OU
scientists	OO
think	OO
that	OO
getting	OO
there	OO
will	OO
rely	OO
on	OO
statistics	OO
and	OO
increased	OO
computing	OO
power	.O
extremely	OU
high	OO
speed	OO
computer	OO
simulations	OO
of	OO
turbulent	OO
flows	OO
could	OO
help	OO
us	OO
identify	OO
patterns	OO
that	OO
could	OO
lead	OO
to	OO
a	OO
theory	OO
that	OO
organizes	OO
and	OO
unifies	OO
predictions	OO
across	OO
different	OO
situations	.O
other	OU
scientists	OO
think	OO
that	OO
the	OO

is	OO
so	OO
complex	OO
that	OO
such	OO
a	OO
full	OO

theory	OO
isn’t	OO
ever	OO
going	OO
to	OO
be	OO
possible	.O
hopefully	OU
we’ll	OO
reach	OO
a	OO
breakthrough	,O
because	OO
a	OO
true	OO
understanding	OO
of	OO
turbulence	OO
could	OO
have	OO
huge	OO
positive	OO
impacts	.O
that	OU
would	OO
include	OO
more	OO
efficient	OO
wind	OO
farms;	OO
the	OO
ability	OO
to	OO
better	OO
prepare	OO
for	OO
catastrophic	OO

events;	OO
or	OO
even	OO
the	OO
power	OO
to	OO

and	,U
of	OO

smoother	OO

for	OO

so	,U
for	OO
the	OO
first	OO
time	OO
in	OO
america's	OU

we	OO
have	OO
five	OO

this	OU

a	OO
generation	OO
characterized	OO
by	OO

work	.O
in	OU

we	OO
can	OO

this	OO

for	OO
the	OO

they	OU

they	OO

the	OO

more	OU

the	OO

in	OO

then	OO

—	OO
you	OO

the	OO
everybody	OO

—	OO

never	OU

they're	OU

they	OU

they're	OO

the	OO

they're	OO

to	OO

it	.O
they	OU
might	OO
be	OO
a	OO
little	OO

idealistic	OO
sometimes	,O
but	OO
in	OO
just	OO
the	OO

we've	OO
seen	OO

in	OO
the	OO

in	OU

than	OO
one	OO
in	OO

people	OO
in	OO
the	OO

labor	OO

is	OO
a	OO
millennial	.O
and	OU
soon	OO
to	OO
join	OO
us	OO
there	,O
generation	OU
z	,U
born	OO
since	OO
2000	,O
our	OO
high	OO

or	OO
soon	OO
to	OO

now	,U
if	OO

any	OO
of	OO

you	OO

there's	OO
a	OO
literal	OO
war	OO
in	OO
the	OO

right	?O
we	OU
see	OO
blog	OO
topics	OO
like	OO
seventeen	OU
reasons	OO
why	OO

are	OO
the	OO
worst	OO
generation	.O
and	OU
why	OU
baby	OO

have	OO
ruined	OO
it	OO
for	OO
everybody	.O
or	OU
bridging	OU
the	OO
great	OO
generational	OO
divide	.O
it's	OU
like	OO
turning	OO
into	OO
this	OO
west	OU
side	OU
story	,U
like	,O
boomers	OO
come	OO
in	OO
one	OO
door	,O
millennials	OO
come	OO
in	OO
another	OO
door	,O
the	OO
lobby	,O
they	OO
just	OO
fight	OO
with	OO
each	OO
other	OO
all	OO
day	,O
complain	,O
go	OO
home	,O
do	OO
the	OO
same	,O
come	OO
back	OO
to	OO
work	,O
right	?O
well	,U
so	OO
what	OO
if	OO
i	OU
told	OO
you	OO
these	OO
generations	OO
may	OO
not	OO
exist	?O
i've	OU
been	OO
spending	OO
some	OO
time	OO
thinking	OO
about	OO
this	OO
and	OO
researching	OO
this	,O
and	OO
fellow	OO
researchers	OO
and	OO
i	OU
aren't	OO
exactly	OO
sure	OO
that	OO
these	OO
generations	OO
are	OO
real	.O
and	OU
in	OO
fact	,O
if	OO
we	OO
can	OO
agree	OO
that	OO
these	OO
groups	OO
even	OO
exist	,O
we	OO
certainly	OO
don't	OO
agree	OO
who	OO
belongs	OO
in	OO
them	.O
and	OU
they	OO
span	OO
something	OO
like	OO
20	OO
years	.O
so	OU
at	OO
whatever	OO
point	OO
in	OO
history	,O
a	OO
one	OO
year	OO
old	OO
and	OO
a	OO
20	OO
year	OO
old	OO
are	OO
said	OO
to	OO
share	OO
the	OO
same	OO
value	OO
system	,O
to	OO
want	OO
the	OO
same	OO
things	OO
at	OO
work	,O
to	OO
have	OO
the	OO
same	OO
stereotypes	OO
working	OO
for	OO
and	OO
against	OO
them	.O
and	OU
in	OO
fact	,O
different	OO
areas	OO
of	OO
the	OO
world	OO
define	OO
these	OO
generations	OO
differently	.O
so	OU
we	OO
can't	OO
even	OO
compare	OO
generations	OO
across	OO
various	OO
areas	OO
of	OO
the	OO
world	.O
and	OU
these	OO
stereotypes	OO
about	OO
each	OO
generation	OO
have	,O
in	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
ways	,O
created	OO
this	OO
self	OO
fulfilling	OO
prophecy	,O
that	OO
people	OO
begin	OO
to	OO
act	OO
as	OO
if	OO
they're	OO
part	OO
of	OO
that	OO
generation	OO
because	OO
we've	OO
said	OO
out	OO
loud	OO
that	OO

is	OO
real	.O
i'm	OU
not	OO
so	OO
sure	OO
that	OO
it	OO
is	.O
and	OU
in	OO
fact	,O
this	OO
idea	OO
of	OO

has	OO
become	OO
deeply	OO
embedded	OO
in	OO
united	OU

when	OU
we	OO
talk	OO
generations	,O
people	OO
know	OO
exactly	OO
what	OO
we're	OO

about	.O
in	OU

a	OO

of	OO

about	OO
each	OO
of	OO
these	OO

and	OU
i'll	OU
tell	OO
you	OO
how	OO
i	OU
know	OO
this	.O
i	OU
did	OO
the	OO
thing	OO
that	OO
every	OO
red	OO

when	OO

i	OU

some	OO

and	OU
this	OO

what	OO
i	OU

google	OU
is	OO
based	OO
on	OO

they	OO

you	OO
with	OO

on	OO
what	OO
other	OO

the	OO

and	OU
it	OO
gave	OO
me	OO
a	OO
really	OO
good	OO
sense	OO
of	OO
what	OO
people	OO
think	OO
about	OO
each	OO
of	OO
these	OO
generations	.O
take	OU
a	OO
look	.O
i	OU
learned	OO
that	OO
baby	OO
boomers	OO
are	OO
conservative	,O
that	OO
americans	OU
think	OO
they're	OO
stupid	.O
the	OU
worst	OO
generation	,O
they're	OO
angry	,O
apparently	OO
they're	OO
racist	OO
and	OO
they're	OO
so	OO
important	.O
looking	OU
at	OO
generation	OU
x	,U
i	OU
learned	OO
generation	OU
x	OU
is	OO
a	OO
cynical	OO
group	,O
they're	OO
angry	,O
they're	OO
known	OO
as	OO
the	OO
lost	OO
generation	OO
—	OO
we	OO
know	OO
this;	OO
they're	OO
the	OO
smallest	OO
generation	.O
apparently	,U
they're	OO
stupid	OO
too	.O
and	OU
mostly	,O
they're	OO
frustrated	OO
with	OO
baby	OO
boomers	.O
alright	,U
millennials	,O
this	OO
is	OO
what	OO
i	OU
learned	OO
about	OO
us	.O
so	,U
we're	OO
obsessed	OO
with	OO
food	.O
we're	OU
also	OO
stupid	,O
ah	.O
we're	OU
lazy	,O
we're	OO
sensitive	,O
we're	OO

we're	OO
also	OO

we	OO

we're	OO

and	OU
perhaps	OO
the	OO
most	OO
terrifying	OO
search	OO
result	OO
on	OO
the	OO
internet	OO
—	OO
generation	OU
z	OU
is	OO
screwed	.O
ok	,U
so	,O
for	OO
five	OO
years	,O
i've	OU
been	OO
talking	OO
to	OO
leaders	OO
and	OO

across	OO
a	OO

of	OO

and	OU
this	OO
is	OO
what	OO
i've	OU
come	OO
to	OO
realize	.O
generations	OU

—	OO
generations	OO
have	OO
become	OO
the	OO
conversation	OO
at	OO

what	OU
i've	OU

is	OO
that	OO
we're	OO
working	OO
under	OO
the	OO
assumption	OO
that	OO
those	OO

true	.O
and	OU
so	,O
what	OO
i	OU
think	OO
is	OO
that	OO

are	OO
now	OO
desperate	OO
to	OO
figure	OO
out	OO
how	OO
to	OO

the	OO

it	.O
we	OU

all	OO

we're	OU
preparing	OO
for	OO
this	OO
wave	OO
of	OO
millennials	OO
to	OO

so	OU
we	OO
prepare	OO
for	OO
hurricanes	,O
right	?O
we	OU
prepare	OO
to	OO
take	OO
the	OO
mcat	,U
we	OO
prepare	OO
for	OO
natural	OO
disasters	.O
why	OU
are	OO
we	OO
preparing	OO
for	OO
23	OO
year	OO

to	OO
come	OO
to	OO
work	?O
i've	OU
talked	OO
to	OO
these	OO
organizations	,O
and	OO
i've	OU
heard	OO
amazing	OO
things	OO
that	OO
they're	OO
doing	OO
to	OO
create	OO
a	OO
workspace	OO
for	OO
everybody	OO
to	OO
get	OO
along	OO
and	OO
to	OO
have	OO
autonomy	OO
and	OO
to	OO
feel	OO
like	OO
they're	OO
thriving	.O
but	OU
i've	OU
also	OO
heard	OO
some	OO
really	OO
incredibly	OO
harebrained	OO
ideas	OO
about	OO
how	OO
to	OO
navigate	OO
the	OO
multigenerational	OO
workplace	.O
are	OU
you	OO
ready	?O
this	OU
is	OO
what	OO
i	OU
saw	.O
i	OU
visited	OO
an	OO
organization	,O
and	OO
they	OO
adopted	OO
this	OO
idea	OO
that	OO
if	OO
you	OO
can	OO
see	OO
it	,O
you	OO
can	OO
be	OO
it	.O
a	OU
really	OO
important	OO
concept	.O
but	OU
i	OU
think	OO
they	OO
blew	OO
it	.O
the	OU
put	OO
pictures	OO
on	OO
the	OO
walls	OO
of	OO
the	OO
ideal	OO

because	OO
if	OO
you	OO
can	OO

it	,O
you	OO
can	OO
be	OO
it	.O
or	OU
like	OO
this	OO
one	.O

i	OU
don't	OO
even	OO
want	OO
to	OO

here	.O
you	OU
don't	OO
get	OO
to	OO

here	,O
apparently	,O
and	OO
hr	OU
seriously	OO
has	OO
problems	OO
with	OO
people	OO
jumping	OO
in	OO

i	OU
promise	OO
you	OO
that	,O
ok	?U
i	OU
talked	OO
to	OO
an	OO

who	OO
recently	OO

how	OO
you	OO

we're	OU

in	OO

people	OU
younger	OO

that	OO

a	OO

of	OO
people	OO
of	OO

we	OU

much	OO
more	OO

and	OU
we're	OO
hearing	OO
this	OO

they	OO

they	OO

they	OO

none	OO
of	OO
these	OO

are	OO
tied	OO
to	OO
a	OO

now	,U

we	OO
see	OO
small	OO

in	OO
what	OO

we	OU

20	OO

they	OU

at	OU

when	OO

that	OO

to	OO

who	OO
they	OO

who	OO
we	OO

we	OO

there	.O
and	OU
i	OU

the	OO

what	OU
if	OO
we	OO
radically	,O
simply	,O
not	OO

what	?O
what	OU
if	OO
we	OO
give	OO
a	OO

to	OO
the	OO

that	OO

or	OU
that	OO

who	OO
asks	OO
for	OO
a	OO

after	OO
two	OO

because	OO
they're	OO

well	,U
maybe	OO
it's	OO
because	OO
that	OO
generation	OO
has	OO
more	OO

than	OO
any	OO
generation	OO
before	OO
them	,O
coming	OO
out	OO

and	OO
they	OO
just	OO
need	OO
the	OO
money	OO
to	OO
keep	OO
going	,O
to	OO
pay	OO

and	OU
suddenly	,O
when	OO
you	OO
meet	OO
people	OO
in	OO
their	OO
onlyness	,O
that	OO
spot	OO
in	OO
the	OO
world	OO
only	OO
they	OO

we're	OO

we're	OU
talking	OO
about	OO
jim	OU
or	OO
jen	OU
or	OO
candice	.U
and	OU
so	OO
here's	OO
my	OO
challenge	OO
to	OO
us	.O
pick	OU
a	OO
person	,O
just	OO
one	,O
and	OO
explore	OO
their	OO
onlyness	.O
and	OU
then	OO
learn	.O
and	OU
then	OO
in	OO
the	OO
moments	OO
where	OO
it's	OO
appropriate	,O
teach	.O
and	OU
figure	OO
out	OO
what	OO
they	OO
bring	OO
to	OO
work	OO
that	OO
no	OO
one	OO
else	OO
can	OO
bring	OO
to	OO
work	,O
because	OO
that's	OO
what	OO
makes	OO
work	OO
richer	.O
and	OU
then	OO
do	OO
it	OO
again	.O
and	OU
do	OO
it	OO
again	.O
and	OU
then	OO
some	OO
day	,O
we're	OO
not	OO
working	OO
with	OO
generations	OO
anymore	.O
we're	OU
working	OO
with	OO
people	.O
and	OU
so	OO
to	OO
really	OO
understand	OO
the	OO
beauty	OO
of	OO
the	OO
multigenerational	OO
workplace	,O
i	OU
think	OO
we	OO
just	OO
have	OO
to	OO
meet	OO
people	OO
where	OO
they	OO
are	.O
and	OU
that	OO
doesn't	OO
require	OO
that	OO
we	OO
unpack	OO
and	OO
live	OO
there	OO
with	OO
them	.O
but	OU
we	OO
might	OO
find	,O
at	OO
least	OO
on	OO
occasion	,O
it's	OO
a	OO
beautiful	OO
place	OO
to	OO
visit	.O
and	OU
so	OO
i	OU
think	OO
there's	OO
just	OO
no	OO
need	OO
to	OO
argue	OO
about	OO
which	OO
generation	OO
is	OO
the	OO
most	OO
angry	OO
or	OO
the	OO
most	OO
entitled	OO
or	OO
the	OO
most	OO
so	OO
obsessed	OO
with	OO
food	.O
we	OU
all	OO
come	OO
to	OO
the	OO
classroom	,O
to	OO
work	,O
back	OO
to	OO
our	OO
homes	,O
a	OO
little	OO
bit	OO
tired	OO
and	OO
a	OO
little	OO
bit	OO
tattered	OO
sometimes	.O
maybe	OU
let's	OO
just	OO
do	OO
our	OO
best	OO
to	OO
humbly	OO
meet	OO
people	OO
where	OO
they	OO
are	,O
how	OO
they	OO
show	OO
up	OO
that	OO
day	,O
generation	OO
and	OO
all	.O
and	OU
in	OO
those	OO
moments	OO
where	OO
it	OO
can	OO
feel	OO
a	OO
little	OO
bit	OO
like	OO
intergenerational	OO
warfare	,O
i	OU
think	OO
we	OO
can	OO
at	OO
least	OO
all	OO
agree	OO
that	OO

for	OU

a	OO

the	OO

when	OO
it	OO

its	OO

in	OO

by	OO

have	OO
been	OO
doing	OO
research	OO
that	OO
has	OO
completely	OO
changed	OO
the	OO
way	OO
we	OO
think	OO
about	OO
the	OO
criminal	OO

the	OO
people	OO
in	OO
it	.O
and	OU
it	OO
may	OO
change	OO
the	OO
way	OO
you	OO
think	OO
about	OO
those	OO
things	,O
too	.O
so	OU
i'll	OU
start	OO
with	OO
a	OO
shocking	OO
statistic:	OO
50	OO
to	OO
80	OO
percent	OO
of	OO
people	OO
in	OO
criminal	OO
justice	OO
have	OO
a	OO
traumatic	OO
brain	OO
injury	.O
up	OU
to	OO
80	OO
percent	.O
in	OU
the	OO
general	OO
public	,O
in	OO
this	OO
room	,O
for	OO
example	,O
that	OO
number	OO
is	OO
less	OO
than	OO
five	OO
percent	.O
and	OU
i'm	OU
not	OO
just	OO
talking	OO
about	OO
getting	OO
your	OO
bell	OO
rung	.O
these	OU
are	OO
the	OO
kinds	OO
of	OO
injuries	OO
that	OO
require	OO
hospitalization	.O
most	OU
of	OO
them	OO
are	OO
the	OO
product	OO
of	OO
a	OO
physical	OO
assault	,O
and	OO
some	OO
of	OO
them	OO
are	OO
actually	OO
sustained	OO
in	OO
jail	.O
all	OU
of	OO
these	OO
numbers	OO
are	OO
even	OO
higher	OO
among	OO
the	OO
women	OO
in	OO
criminal	OO
justice	.O
almost	OU
every	OO
single	OO
woman	OO
in	OO
the	OO
criminal	OO
justice	OO
system	OO
has	OO
been	OO
exposed	OO
to	OO
interpersonal	OO

more	OU
than	OO
half	OO
of	OO
these	OO
women	OO
have	OO
been	OO
exposed	OO
to	OO
repeated	OO
brain	OO
injuries	.O
in	OU
this	OO
way	,O
these	OO
women's	OO
brains	OO
look	OO
like	OO
the	OO
brains	OO
of	OO
retired	OO
nfl	OU
players	,O
and	OO
they'll	OO
likely	OO
face	OO
the	OO

risks	OO
for	OO
dementing	OO

as	OO
they	OO
age	.O
the	OU
same	OO
risks	.O
tbi	,U
together	OO
with	OO
mental	OO
illness	OO
and	OO
substance	OO
abuse	OO
and	OO
trauma	,O
makes	OO
it	OO
hard	OO
for	OO
people	OO
to	OO
think	.O
they	OU
have	OO
cognitive	OO
impairments	OO
like	OO
poor	OO
judgment	OO
and	OO
poor	OO
impulse	OO

problems	OO
that	OO
make	OO
criminal	OO
justice	OO
a	OO
revolving	OO
door	.O
people	OU
get	OO
arrested	OO
and	OO
booked	OO
into	OO
jail	.O
they	OU
oftentimes	OO
get	OO
into	OO
trouble	OO
while	OO
they're	OO
in	OO
there	.O
they	OU
get	OO
into	OO
fights	.O
they	OU
fall	OO
out	OO
of	OO
their	OO

and	OU
then	OO
they	OO
get	OO
released	OO
and	OO
do	OO
stupid	OO
things	,O
like	OO
forgetting	OO
mandatory	OO
check	OO
ins	,O
and	OO
they	OO
get	OO
rearrested	.O
statistically	OU
speaking	,O
they're	OO
actually	OO
more	OO
likely	OO
to	OO
be	OO
rearrested	OO
than	OO
not	.O
a	OU

this	OO
serving	OO
a	OO
life	OO

30	OO

at	OO
a	OO
time	.O
and	OU
oftentimes	,O
these	OO

why	OO
this	OO
is	OO
so	OO
hard	OO
for	OO
them	.O
they	OU
feel	OO
out	OO

so	OU
knowing	OO
that	OO
tbi	OU
is	OO
at	OO
the	OO
root	OO
of	OO
so	OO
many	OO
of	OO
these	OO
challenges	,O
the	OO
mission	OO
for	OO
a	OO
group	OO
of	OO
us	OO
in	OO
colorado	OU
has	OO
been	OO
to	OO
disrupt	OO
that	OO
cycle	,O
to	OO
jam	OO
the	OO
revolving	OO
the	OO
door	.O
so	OU
working	OO
together	OO
with	OO
my	OO
state	OO
and	OO
local	OO
partners	,O
we	OO
crafted	OO
a	OO
plan	OO
to	OO
meet	OO
everyone's	OO
needs:	OO
the	OO
system	,O
the	OO
inmates	OO
and	OO
probationers	,O
my	OO
graduate	OO
students	.O
in	OU
this	OO
program	,O
we	OO
assess	OO
how	OO
each	OO
person's	OO
brain	OO
works	OO
so	OO
that	OO
we	OO
can	OO
recommend	OO
basic	OO
modifications	OO
to	OO
make	OO
this	OO
system	OO
more	OO
effective	OO
and	OO
safer	.O
and	OU
here	OO
when	OO
i	OU
say	OO
safer	,O
i	OU
mean	OO
safer	OO
not	OO
only	OO
for	OO
the	OO
inmates	,O
but	OO
safer	OO
also	OO
for	OO
correctional	OO
staff	.O
in	OU
some	OO
ways	,O
this	OO
is	OO
such	OO
a	OO
simple	OO
approach	.O
we're	OU
not	OO
treating	OO
the	OO
brain	OO
injury	,O
we're	OO
treating	OO
the	OO
underlying	OO
problem	OO
that	OO
gets	OO
people	OO
into	OO
all	OO
of	OO
this	OO
trouble	OO
in	OO
the	OO
first	OO
place	.O
we	OU
do	OO
quick	OO
neuropsychological	OO
screening	OO
tests	OO
to	OO
identify	OO
strengths	OO
and	OO
weaknesses	OO
in	OO
the	OO
way	OO
an	OO
inmate	OO
thinks	.O
using	OU
that	OO
information	,O
we	OO
write	OO
two	OO
reports	.O
one	,U
a	OO
report	OO
for	OO
the	OO
system	OO
with	OO
specific	OO
recommendations	OO
on	OO
how	OO
to	OO
manage	OO
that	OO
inmate	.O
the	OU
other	OO
is	OO
a	OO
letter	OO
to	OO
the	OO
inmate	OO
with	OO
specific	OO
suggestions	OO
for	OO
how	OO
to	OO
manage	OO
themselves	.O
for	OU
example	,O
if	OO
our	OO
test	OO
result	OO
suggests	OO
that	OO
a	OO
probationer	OO
has	OO
a	OO
hard	OO
time	OO
remembering	OO
the	OO
things	OO
they	OO
hear	,O
that	OO
would	OO
be	OO
an	OO
auditory	OO
memory	OO
deficit	.O
in	OU
that	OO
case	,O
our	OO
letter	OO
to	OO
the	OO
court	OO
might	OO
suggest	OO
that	OO
that	OO
probationer	OO
get	OO
handouts	OO
of	OO
important	OO
information	.O
and	OU
our	OO
letter	OO
to	OO
that	OO
probationer	OO
would	OO
say	,O
among	OO
other	OO
things	,O
that	OO
they	OO
should	OO
carry	OO
a	OO
notebook	OO
to	OO
record	OO
that	OO
information	OO
for	OO
themselves	.O
now	,U
most	OO
importantly	,O
is	OO
that	OO
i	OU
pause	OO
here	OO
to	OO
be	OO
really	OO
clear	OO
about	OO
one	OO
point	.O
this	OU
program	OO
does	OO
not	OO
minimize	OO
responsibility	OO
or	OO
make	OO
excuses	OO
for	OO
anyone's	OO
behavior	.O
this	OU
is	OO
about	OO
changing	OO
longstanding	OO
negative	OO
perceptions	OO
and	OO
building	OO
self	OO

it's	OU
actually	OO
about	OO
taking	OO

the	OU

here's	OO
what	OO

to	OO

about	OO

the	OO

the	OO

there	OO
are	,O
and	OO
just	OO

at	OO
the	OO

the	OO

the	OO

at	OO
the	OO

right	OU
now	OO
all	OO
three	OO

odd	,O
but	OO
you	OO
get	OO
to	OO
add	OO
an	OO
egg	OO
to	OO
one	OO

which	OO
means	OO
that	OO
it’ll	OO
be	OO

the	OO

whichever	OU

when	OO
they’re	OO

since	OO
every	OO

we	OU

that	OU

at	OO

you	OO
add	OO
a	OO

the	OO

and	OO
99	OO

a	OO

the	OU

it's	OU
so	OO
fun	,O
it	OO

a	OO
little	OO
frivolous	,O

at	OO
a	OO
time	OO
where	OO
we're	OO
being	OO
confronted	OO
with	OO
some	OO
pretty	OO
depressing	OO
headlines	.O
but	OU
it	OO
turns	OO
out	OO
that	OO

provide	OO
a	OO
key	OO
to	OO
solving	OO
some	OO
of	OO
the	OO
toughest	OO
problems	OO
we're	OO

it's	OU
taken	OO
me	OO
almost	OO
a	OO
decade	OO
to	OO
figure	OO
this	OO
out	.O
pretty	OU
early	OO
on	OO
in	OO
my	OO

a	OO

on	OO

happiness	.U
i	OU
was	OO
very	OO
confident	OO
in	OO
this	OO
conclusion	,O
except	OO
for	OO
one	OO
thing:	OO
it	OO
didn't	OO
seem	OO
to	OO
apply	OO
to	OO
me	.O
i	OU
hardly	OO
ever	OO
gave	OO
money	OO
to	OO

and	OO
when	OO
i	OU
did	,O
i	OU
didn't	OO
feel	OO
that	OO
warm	OO
glow	OO
i	OU
was	OO
expecting	.O
so	OU
i	OU
started	OO
to	OO
wonder	OO
if	OO
maybe	OO
there	OO
was	OO
something	OO
wrong	OO
with	OO
my	OO

or	OO
something	OO
wrong	OO
with	OO
me	.O
my	OU
own	OO
lackluster	OO
emotional	OO
response	OO
to	OO

was	OO
especially	OO
puzzling	OO
because	OO
my	OO
follow	OO
up	OO
studies	OO
revealed	OO
that	OO
even	OO

exhibited	OO
joy	OO
from	OO
giving	OO
to	OO
others	.O
in	OU
one	OO
experiment	,O
my	OO
colleagues	OO
kiley	OU
hamlin	,U
lara	OU
aknin	OU

i	OU
brought	OO

under	OO
the	OO

two	OO
into	OO
the	OO

now	,U
as	OO

we	OO

to	OO
work	OO
with	OO
a	OO

that	OO

really	OO
care	OO
about	,O
so	OO
we	OO
used	OO
the	OO
toddler	OO
equivalent	OO
of	OO
gold	,O

we	OU
gave	OO

away	OO
to	OO
a	OO

this	OO

200,000	OO

a	OO

if	OO

on	OO
an	OO

that	OO

around	OO

you	OO
start	OO
to	OO
wonder:	OO
could	OU
this	OO

part	OO
of	OO

nature	?O
we	OU

that	OO

that	OO

and	OO
it	OO

to	OO

one	OO
of	OO
those	OO
behaviors	.O
i	OU
was	OO
really	OO
excited	OO
about	OO

i	OU

about	OO

my	OO

at	OU

time	,O
i	OU
found	OO
myself	OO
seated	OO
across	OO
from	OO

watching	OO
as	OO
he	OO
slowly	OO
tapped	OO
his	OO
pen	OO
on	OO
the	OO

of	OO
my	OO

with	OO

despite	OU
building	OO
my	OO

by	OO

can	OO
feel	,O
i	OU
actually	OO
wasn't	OO
doing	OO
very	OO
much	OO
of	OO
it	.O
so	OU
i	OU
resolved	OO
to	OO
give	OO
more	.O
around	OU
that	OO
time	,O
devastating	OO
stories	OO
about	OO
the	OO
syrian	OU
refugee	OO
crisis	OO
were	OO
everywhere	.O
i	OU
really	OO
wanted	OO
to	OO
help	,O
so	OO
i	OU
pulled	OO
out	OO
my	OO
credit	OO
card	.O
i	OU
knew	OO
my	OO
donations	OO
would	OO
probably	OO
make	OO
a	OO
difference	OO
for	OO
someone	OO
somewhere	,O
but	OO
going	OO
to	OO
the	OO
website	OO
of	OO
an	OO
effective	OO
charity	OO
and	OO
entering	OO
my	OO
visa	OU
number	OO
still	OO
just	OO
didn't	OO
feel	OO
like	OO
enough	.O
that's	OU
when	OO
i	OU
learned	OO
about	OO
the	OO
group	OU
of	OO
five	.U
the	OU
canadian	OU
government	OO
allows	OO
any	OO
five	OO
canadians	OU
to	OO
privately	OO
sponsor	OO
a	OO
family	OO
of	OO
refugees	.O
you	OU
have	OO
to	OO
raise	OO
enough	OO
money	OO
to	OO
support	OO
the	OO
family	OO
for	OO
their	OO
first	OO
year	OO
in	OO
canada	,U
and	OO
then	OO
they	OO
literally	OO
get	OO
on	OO
a	OO
plane	OO
to	OO
your	OO
city	.O
one	OU
of	OO
the	OO
things	OO
that	OO
i	OU
think	OO
is	OO
so	OO
cool	OO
about	OO
this	OO
program	OO
is	OO
that	OO
no	OO
one	OO
is	OO
allowed	OO
to	OO
do	OO
it	OO
alone	.O
and	OU
instead	OO
of	OO
a	OO
group	OU
of	OO
five	,U
we	OO
ended	OO
up	OO
partnering	OO
with	OO
a	OO
community	OO
organization	OO
and	OO
forming	OO
a	OO
group	OO
of	OO
25	.O
after	OU
almost	OO
two	OO
years	OO
of	OO
paperwork	OO
and	OO
waiting	,O
we	OO
learned	OO
that	OO
our	OO
family	OO
would	OO
be	OO
arriving	OO
in	OO
vancouver	OU
in	OO
less	OO
than	OO
six	OO
weeks	.O
they	OU
had	OO
four	OO
sons	OO
and	OO
a	OO
daughter	,O
so	OO
we	OO
raced	OO
to	OO
find	OO
them	OO
a	OO
place	OO
to	OO
live	.O
we	OU
were	OO
very	OO
lucky	OO
to	OO
find	OO
them	OO
a	OO
house	,O
but	OO
it	OO
needed	OO
quite	OO
a	OO
bit	OO
of	OO
work	.O
so	OU
my	OO
friends	OO
came	OO
out	OO
on	OO
evenings	OO
and	OO
weekends	OO
and	OO
painted	OO
and	OO
cleaned	OO
and	OO
assembled	OO
furniture	.O
when	OU
the	OO
big	OO
day	OO
came	,O
we	OO
filled	OO
their	OO
fridge	OO
with	OO
milk	OO
and	OO
fresh	OO
fruit	OO
and	OO
headed	OO
to	OO
the	OO
airport	OO
to	OO
meet	OO
our	OO
family	.O
it	OU
was	OO
a	OO
little	OO
overwhelming	OO
for	OO
everyone	,O
especially	OO
the	OO
four	OO
year	OO
old	.O
his	OU
mother	OO
was	OO
reunited	OO
with	OO
her	OO
sister	OO
who	OO
had	OO
come	OO
to	OO
canada	OU
earlier	OO
through	OO
the	OO
same	OO
program	.O
they	OU
hadn't	OO
seen	OO
each	OO
other	OO
in	OO
15	OO
years	.O
when	OU
you	OO
hear	OO
that	OO
more	OO
than	OO
5.6	OO
million	OO
refugees	OO
have	OO
fled	OO
syria	,U
you're	OO
faced	OO
with	OO
this	OO
tragedy	OO
that	OO
the	OO
human	OO
brain	OO
hasn't	OO
really	OO
evolved	OO
to	OO
comprehend	.O
it's	OU
so	OO
abstract	.O
before	,U
if	OO
any	OO
of	OO
us	OO
had	OO
been	OO
asked	OO
to	OO
donate	OO
15	OO
hours	OO
a	OO
month	OO
to	OO
help	OO
out	OO
with	OO
the	OO
refugee	OO
crisis	,O
we	OO
probably	OO
would	OO
have	OO
said	OO
no	.O
but	OU
as	OO
soon	OO
as	OO
we	OO
took	OO
our	OO
family	OO
to	OO
their	OO
new	OO
home	OO
in	OO
vancouver	,U
we	OO
all	OO
had	OO
the	OO
same	OO
realization:	OO
we	OO
were	OO
just	OO
going	OO
to	OO
do	OO
whatever	OO
it	OO
took	OO
to	OO
help	OO
them	OO
be	OO
happy	.O
this	OU
experience	OO
made	OO
me	OO
think	OO
a	OO
little	OO
more	OO
deeply	OO
about	OO
my	OO
research	.O
back	OU
in	OO
my	OO
lab	,O
we'd	OO
seen	OO
the	OO
benefits	OO
of	OO
giving	OO
spike	OO
when	OO
people	OO
felt	OO
a	OO
real	OO
sense	OO
of	OO
connection	OO
with	OO
those	OO
they	OO
were	OO
helping	OO
and	OO
could	OO
easily	OO
envision	OO
the	OO
difference	OO
they	OO
were	OO
making	OO
in	OO
those	OO
individuals'	OO
lives	.O
for	OU
example	,O
in	OO
one	OO
experiment	,O
we	OO
gave	OO
participants	OO
an	OO
opportunity	OO
to	OO
donate	OO
a	OO
bit	OO
of	OO
money	OO
to	OO
either	OO
unicef	OU
or	OO
spread	OU
the	OO
net	.U
we	OU
chose	OO
these	OO
charities	OO
intentionally	,O
because	OO
they	OO
were	OO
partners	OO
and	OO
shared	OO
the	OO
same	OO
critically	OO
important	OO
goal	OO
of	OO
promoting	OO
children's	OO
health	.O
but	OU
i	OU
think	OO
unicef	OU
is	OO
just	OO
such	OO
a	OO
big	,O
broad	OO
charity	OO
that	OO
it	OO
can	OO
be	OO
a	OO
little	OO
hard	OO
to	OO
envision	OO
how	OO
your	OO
own	OO
small	OO
donation	OO
will	OO
make	OO
a	OO
difference	.O
in	OU
contrast	,O
spread	OU
the	OO
net	OU
offers	OO
donors	OO
a	OO
concrete	OO
promise:	OO
for	OO
every	OO
10	OO
dollars	OO
donated	,O
they	OO
provide	OO
one	OO
bed	OO
net	OO
to	OO
protect	OO
a	OO
child	OO
from	OO
malaria	.O
we	OU
saw	OO
that	OO
the	OO
more	OO
money	OO
people	OO
gave	OO
to	OO
spread	OU
the	OO
net	,U
the	OO
happier	OO
they	OO
reported	OO
feeling	OO
afterward	.O
in	OU
contrast	,O
this	OO
emotional	OO
return	OO
on	OO
investment	OO
was	OO
completely	OO
eliminated	OO
when	OO
people	OO
gave	OO
money	OO
to	OO
unicef	.U
so	OU
this	OO
suggests	OO
that	OO
just	OO
giving	OO
money	OO
to	OO
a	OO
worthwhile	OO
charity	OO
isn't	OO
always	OO
enough	.O
you	OU
need	OO
to	OO
be	OO
able	OO
to	OO
envision	OO
how	,O
exactly	,O
your	OO
dollars	OO
are	OO
going	OO
to	OO
make	OO
a	OO
difference	.O
of	OU
course	,O
the	OO
group	OU
of	OO
five	OU
program	OO
takes	OO
this	OO
idea	OO
to	OO
a	OO
whole	OO
new	OO
level	.O
when	OU
we	OO
first	OO
took	OO
on	OO
this	OO
project	,O
we	OO
would	OO
talk	OO
about	OO
when	OO
the	OO
refugees	OO
would	OO
arrive	.O
now	,U
we	OO
just	OO
refer	OO
to	OO
them	OO
as	OO
our	OO
family	.O
recently	,U
we	OO
took	OO
the	OO
kids	OO
ice	OO
skating	,O
and	OO
later	OO
that	OO
day	,O
my	OO
six	OO
year	OO
old	,O
oliver	,U
asked	OO
me	,O
mommy	,U
who	OO
is	OO
the	OO
oldest	OO
kid	OO
in	OO
our	OO
family	?O
i	OU
assumed	OO
he	OO
was	OO
talking	OO
about	OO
his	OO
plethora	OO
of	OO
cousins	,O
and	OO
he	OO
was	OO
talking	OO
about	OO
them	,O
but	OO
also	OO
about	OO
our	OO
syrian	OU
family	.O
since	OU
our	OO
family	OO
arrived	,O
so	OO
many	OO
people	OO
and	OO
organizations	OO
have	OO
offered	OO
to	OO
help	,O
providing	OO
everything	OO
from	OO
free	OO
dental	OO
fillings	OO
to	OO
summer	OO
camps	.O
it's	OU
made	OO
me	OO
see	OO
the	OO
goodness	OO
that	OO
exists	OO
in	OO
our	OO
community	.O
thanks	OU
to	OO
one	OO
donation	,O
the	OO

to	OO
go	OO
to	OO

camp	,O
and	OO
every	OO
day	OO
of	OO
the	OO
week	,O
some	OO
member	OO
of	OO
our	OO
group	OO
tried	OO
to	OO
be	OO
there	OO
to	OO
cheer	OO
for	OO
them	.O
i	OU
happened	OO
to	OO
be	OO
there	OO
the	OO
day	OO
the	OO
training	OO
wheels	OO
were	OO
supposed	OO
to	OO
come	OO
off	,O
and	OO
let	OO
me	OO
tell	OO
you	,O
the	OO
four	OO
year	OO
old	OO
did	OO
not	OO
think	OO
this	OO
was	OO
a	OO
good	OO
idea	.O
so	OU
i	OU
went	OO
over	OO
and	OO
talked	OO
to	OO
him	OO
about	OO
the	OO
long	OO
term	OO
benefits	OO
of	OO
riding	OO
without	OO
training	OO
wheels	.O
then	OU
i	OU
remembered	OO
that	OO
he	OO
was	OO
four	OO
and	OO
barely	OO
spoke	OO
english	.U
so	OU
i	OU
reverted	OO
to	OO
two	OO
words	OO
he	OO
definitely	OO
knew:	OO
ice	OO
cream	.O
you	OU
try	OO
without	OO
training	OO
wheels	,O
i'll	OU
buy	OO
you	OO
ice	OO
cream	.O
here's	OU
what	OO
happened	OO
next	.O
ed:	OU
yes	.U
yeah	.U
kid:	OU
i'm	OU
gonna	OO
try	.O
ed:	OU
oh	OU
my	OO
god	.U
look	OU
at	OO
you	OO
go	.O
look	OU
at	OO
you	OO
go	.O
you're	OU
doing	OO
it	OO
all	OO
by	OO
yourself	.O
ed:	OU
good	OU
job	.O
ed:	OU
so	OU
this	OO
is	OO
the	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
helping	OO
that	OO
human	OO
beings	OO
evolved	OO
to	OO
enjoy	,O
but	OO
for	OO
40	OO
years	,O
canada	OU
was	OO
the	OO
only	OO
country	OO
in	OO
the	OO
world	OO
that	OO
allowed	OO
private	OO
citizens	OO
to	OO
sponsor	OO
refugees	.O
now	OU
—	OO
canada	.U
it's	OU
pretty	OO
great	.O
now	OU
australia	OU
and	OO
the	OO
uk	OU
are	OO
starting	OO
up	OO

just	OU
imagine	OO
how	OO
different	OO
the	OO
refugee	OO
crisis	OO
could	OO
look	OO
if	OO

countries	OO
made	OO
this	OO
possible	.O
creating	OU
these	OO
kinds	OO
of	OO
meaningful	OO

that	OO

one	OU
of	OO
those	OO

lies	OO
just	OO

where	OO
i'm	OU
standing	OO
right	OO
now	,O
in	OO
the	OO
downtown	OU
eastside	OU
of	OO
vancouver	.U
by	OU
some	OO
measures	,O
it's	OO
the	OO
poorest	OO
urban	OO
postal	OO
code	OO
in	OO
canada	.U
we	OU
actually	OO
debated	OO
whether	OO
to	OO
bring	OO
over	OO
a	OO
family	OO
of	OO
refugees	,O
because	OO
there	OO
are	OO
so	OO
many	OO
people	OO
right	OO
here	OO
already	OO
struggling	.O
my	OU
friend	OO
evan	OU
told	OO
me	OO
that	OO
when	OO
he	OO
was	OO
a	OO
kid	OO
and	OO
his	OO
parents	OO
drove	OO
through	OO
this	OO
neighborhood	,O
he	OO
would	OO
duck	OO
down	OO
in	OO
the	OO
back	OO
seat	.O
but	OU
evan's	OU
parents	OO
never	OO
would	OO
have	OO
guessed	OO
that	OO
when	OO
he	OO
grew	OO
up	,O
he	OO
would	OO
open	OO
up	OO
the	OO
doors	OO
of	OO
a	OO
local	OO
restaurant	OO
and	OO
invite	OO
this	OO
community	OO
inside	OO
to	OO
enjoy	OO
three	OO
course	OO
dinners	.O
the	OU
program	OO
that	OO
evan	OU
helped	OO
build	OO
is	OO
called	OO
plenty	OU
of	OO
plates	,U
and	OO
the	OO
goal	OO
is	OO
not	OO
just	OO
to	OO
provide	OO
free	OO
meals	OO
but	OO
to	OO
create	OO
moments	OO
of	OO
connection	OO
between	OO
people	OO
who	OO
otherwise	OO
might	OO
never	OO
make	OO
eye	OO
contact	.O
each	OU
night	,O
a	OO
local	OO
business	OO
sponsors	OO
the	OO
dinner	OO
and	OO
sends	OO
a	OO
team	OO
of	OO
volunteers	OO
who	OO
help	OO
make	OO
and	OO
serve	OO
the	OO
meal	.O
afterward	,U
the	OO
leftovers	OO
get	OO
distributed	OO
to	OO
people	OO
who	OO
are	OO
out	OO
on	OO
the	OO
street	,O
and	OO
importantly	,O
there's	OO
enough	OO
money	OO
left	OO
to	OO
provide	OO
a	OO
thousand	OO
free	OO
lunches	OO
for	OO
this	OO
community	OO
in	OO
the	OO
days	OO
that	OO
follow	.O
but	OU
the	OO
benefits	OO
of	OO
this	OO
program	OO
extend	OO
beyond	OO
food	.O
for	OU
the	OO
volunteers	,O
it	OO
provides	OO
an	OO
opportunity	OO
to	OO
engage	OO
with	OO
people	,O
to	OO
sit	OO
down	OO
and	OO
hear	OO
their	OO
stories	.O
after	OU
this	OO
experience	,O
one	OO
volunteer	OO
changed	OO
his	OO
commute	OO
so	OO
that	OO
instead	OO
of	OO
avoiding	OO
this	OO
neighborhood	,O
he	OO
walks	OO
through	OO
it	,O
smiling	OO
or	OO
making	OO
eye	OO

as	OO
he	OO
passes	OO
familiar	OO

all	OU
of	OO
us	OO
are	OO
capable	OO
of	OO
finding	OO
joy	OO
in	OO
giving	.O
but	OU
we	OO
shouldn't	OO
expect	OO
this	OO
to	OO
happen	OO
automatically	.O
spending	OU
money	OO
helping	OO
others	OO
doesn't	OO
necessarily	OO
promote	OO
happiness	.O
instead	,U
it	OO
matters	OO
how	OO
we	OO
do	OO
it	.O
and	OU
if	OO
we	OO
want	OO
people	OO
to	OO
give	OO
more	,O
we	OO
need	OO
to	OO

the	OO

about	OO

we	OU
need	OO
to	OO

the	OO

that	OO
we	OO
have	OO

to	OO

let's	OU
stop	OO
thinking	OO
about	OO

as	OO
just	OO
this	OO
moral	OO

and	OO
start	OO
thinking	OO
of	OO
it	OO
as	OO
a	OO
source	OO
of	OO
pleasure	.O

the	OO
thing	OO
is	OO
—	OO
my	OO

it's	OU
a	OO

of	OO

there	OU
you	OO

that's	OU
just	OO
a	OO
bit	OO
a	OO
joke	,O
there	.O
i	OU
like	OO
to	OO
kick	OO
things	OO
off	OO
with	OO
a	OO
joke	OO
because	OO
i'm	OU
a	OO
comedian	.O
now	OU
there's	OO

things	OO

i'm	OU
a	OO

i'm	OU

here's	OU
a	OO

thing	OO
you	OO
can	OO
know	OO
about	OO
me:	OO
i	OU
don't	OO

i'm	OU
qualified	OO
to	OO

it's	OO

i've	OU

had	OO
a	OO
great	OO

so	OU
it	OO
seems	OO
a	OO
bit	OO
of	OO
a	OO
contradiction	,O
then	,O
that	OO
someone	OO

me	,O
who	OO
is	OO
so	OO
bad	OO
at	OO
the	OO

could	OO
be	OO
something	OO

a	OO

there	OO
you	OO

there	OU
you	OO

what	OO
it	OO

the	OO
most	OO

i	OU

three	OU
ideas	,O
three	OO
contradictions	.O
now	,U
if	OO
you're	OO
wondering	OO
why	OO
there's	OO
only	OO
two	OO
things	OO
on	OO
my	OO
so	OO
called	OO
list	OO
of	OO
three	OO
—	OO
i	OU
remind	OO
you	OO
it	OO
is	OO
literally	OO
a	OO
list	OO
of	OO
contradictions	.O
keep	OU
up	.O
now	,U
the	OO
folks	OO
at	OO
ted	OU
advised	OO
me	OO
that	OO
with	OO
a	OO
talk	OO
of	OO
this	OO
length	,O
it's	OO
best	OO
to	OO
stick	OO
with	OO
just	OO
sharing	OO
one	OO
idea	.O
i	OU
said	OO
no	.O
what	OU
would	OO
they	OO
know	?O
to	OU
explain	OO
why	OO
i	OU
have	OO
chosen	OO
to	OO

what	OO
is	OO
clearly	OO
very	OO
good	OO
advice	,O
i	OU
want	OO
to	OO
take	OO
you	OO
back	OO
to	OO
the	OO
beginning	OO
of	OO
this	OO
talk	,O
specifically	,O
my	OO
palindrome	OO
joke	.O
now	OU
that	OO
joke	OO
uses	OO
my	OO
favorite	OO
trick	OO
of	OO
the	OO
comedian	OO
trade	,O
the	OO
rule	OO
of	OO
three	,O
whereby	OO
you	OO
make	OO
a	OO
statement	OO
and	OO
then	OO
back	OO
that	OO
statement	OO
up	OO
with	OO
a	OO
list	.O
my	OU
entire	OO
family	OO
have	OO
palindromic	OO
names:	OO
mum	,U
dad	,U
nan	,U
pop	.U
the	OU
first	OO
two	OO
ideas	OO
on	OO
that	OO
list	OO
create	OO
a	OO
pattern	,O
and	OO
that	OO
pattern	OO
creates	OO
expectation	.O
and	OU
then	OO
the	OO
third	OO
thing	OO
—	OO
bam	.O
—	OO
kayak	.U
what	?U
that's	OU
the	OO
rule	OO
of	OO
three	.O
one	,U
two	,O
surprise	.O
ha	OU
ha	.O
now	,U
the	OO
rule	OO
of	OO
three	OO
is	OO
not	OO
only	OO
fundamental	OO
to	OO
the	OO
way	OO
i	OU
do	OO
my	OO
craft	,O
it	OO
is	OO
also	OO
fundamental	OO
to	OO
the	OO
way	OO
i	OU
communicate	.O
so	OU
i	OU
won't	OO
be	OO
changing	OO
anything	OO
for	OO
nobody	,O
not	OO
even	OO
ted	,U
which	,O
i	OU
will	OO
point	OO
out	,O

for	OO
three	OO
ideas:	OO
technology	,O
entertainment	OO
and	OO
dickheads	.O
works	OU
every	OO
time	,O
doesn't	OO
it	?O
but	OU
you	OO
need	OO
more	OO
than	OO
just	OO
jokes	OO
to	OO
be	OO
able	OO
to	OO
cut	OO
it	OO
as	OO
a	OO
professional	OO
comedian	.O
you	OU
need	OO
to	OO
be	OO
able	OO
to	OO
walk	OO
that	OO
fine	OO
line	OO
between	OO
being	OO
charming	OO
and	OO
disarming	.O
and	OU
i	OU
discovered	OO
the	OO
most	OO
effective	OO
way	OO
to	OO
generate	OO
the	OO
amount	OO
of	OO
charm	OO
i	OU
needed	OO
to	OO
offset	OO
my	OO
disarming	OO
personality	OO
was	OO
through	OO
not	OO
jokes	OO
but	OO
stories	.O
so	OU
my	OO

stories	OO
about	OO

that	OO

and	OO
i'm	OU
going	OO
to	OO
tell	OO
you	OO
a	OO
story	OO
about	OO
everything	OO
i've	OU
just	OO
said	.O
in	OU
the	OO
last	OO
few	OO
days	OO
of	OO
her	OO
life	,O
my	OO
grandma	OO
was	OO
surrounded	OO
by	OO
people	,O
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
people	,O
because	OO
my	OO
grandma	OO
was	OO
the	OO
loving	OO
matriarch	OO
of	OO
a	OO
large	OO
and	OO
loving	OO
family	.O
now	,U
if	OO
you	OO
haven't	OO
made	OO
the	OO
connection	OO
already	,O
i	OU
am	OO
a	OO
member	OO
of	OO
that	OO
family	.O
i	OU
was	OO
lucky	OO
enough	OO
to	OO
be	OO
able	OO
to	OO
say	OO
goodbye	OO
to	OO
my	OO
grandma	OO
on	OO
the	OO
day	OO
she	OO
died	.O
but	OU
as	OO
she	OO
was	OO
already	OO
cocooned	OO
within	OO
herself	OO
by	OO
then	,O
it	OO
was	OO
something	OO
of	OO
a	OO
one	OO
sided	OO
goodbye	.O
so	OU
i	OU
thought	OO
about	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
things	,O
things	OO
i	OU
hadn't	OO
thought	OO
about	OO
in	OO
a	OO
long	OO
time	,O
like	OO
the	OO
letters	OO
i	OU
used	OO
to	OO
write	OO
to	OO
my	OO
grandma	OO
when	OO
i	OU
first	OO
started	OO
university	,O
letters	OO
i	OU
filled	OO
with	OO
funny	OO
stories	OO
and	OO
anecdotes	OO
that	OO
i	OU
embellished	OO
for	OO
her	OO
amusement	.O
and	OU
i	OU
remembered	OO
how	OO
i	OU
couldn't	OO
articulate	OO
the	OO
anxiety	OO
and	OO
fear	OO
that	OO
filled	OO
me	OO
as	OO
i	OU
tried	OO
to	OO
carve	OO
my	OO
tiny	OO
little	OO
life	OO
into	OO
a	OO
world	OO
that	OO
felt	OO
far	OO
too	OO
big	OO
for	OO
me	.O
but	OU
i	OU
remembered	OO
finding	OO
comfort	OO
in	OO
those	OO
letters	,O
because	OO
i	OU
wrote	OO
them	OO
with	OO
my	OO
grandma	OO
in	OO
mind	.O
but	OU
as	OO
the	OO
world	OO
got	OO
more	OO
and	OO
more	OO
overwhelming	OO
and	OO
my	OO
ability	OO
to	OO
negotiate	OO
it	OO
got	OO
worse	,O
not	OO
better	,O
i	OU
stopped	OO
writing	OO
those	OO
letters	.O
i	OU
just	OO
didn't	OO
think	OO
i	OU
had	OO
the	OO
life	OO
that	OO
grandma	OU
would	OO
want	OO
to	OO
read	OO
about	.O
grandma	OU
did	OO
not	OO
know	OO
i	OU
was	OO
gay	,O
and	OO
about	OO
six	OO
months	OO
before	OO
she	OO
died	,O
out	OO
of	OO
nowhere	,O
she	OO
asked	OO
me	OO
if	OO
i	OU
had	OO
a	OO
boyfriend	.O
now	,U
i	OU
remember	OO
making	OO
a	OO
conscious	OO
decision	OO
in	OO
that	OO
moment	OO
not	OO
to	OO
come	OO
out	OO
to	OO
my	OO
grandmother	.O
and	OU
i	OU
did	OO
that	OO
because	OO
i	OU
knew	OO
her	OO
life	OO
was	OO
drawing	OO
to	OO
an	OO
end	,O
and	OO
my	OO
time	OO
with	OO
her	OO
was	OO
finite	,O
and	OO
i	OU
did	OO
not	OO
want	OO
to	OO
talk	OO
about	OO
the	OO
ways	OO
we	OO
were	OO
different	.O
i	OU
wanted	OO
to	OO
talk	OO
about	OO
the	OO
ways	OO
were	OO
we	OO
connected	.O
so	OU
i	OU
changed	OO
the	OO
subject	.O
and	OU
at	OO
the	OO
time	,O
it	OO
felt	OO
like	OO
the	OO
right	OO
decision	.O
but	OU
as	OO
i	OU
sat	OO
witness	OO
to	OO
my	OO
grandmother's	OO
life	OO
as	OO
it	OO
tapered	OO
to	OO
its	OO
inevitable	OO
end	,O
i	OU
couldn't	OO
help	OO
but	OO
feel	OO
i'd	OU
made	OO
a	OO
mistake	OO
not	OO
to	OO
share	OO
such	OO
a	OO
significant	OO
part	OO
of	OO
my	OO
life	.O
but	OU
i	OU
also	OO
knew	OO
that	OO
i'd	OU
missed	OO
my	OO
opportunity	,O
and	OO
as	OO
grandma	OU
always	OO
used	OO
to	OO
say	,O
ah	,U
well	,O
it's	OO
all	OO
part	OO
of	OO
the	OO
soup	.O
too	OU
late	OO
to	OO
take	OO
the	OO
onions	OO
out	OO
now	.O
and	OU
i	OU
thought	OO
about	OO
that	,O
and	OO
i	OU
thought	OO
about	OO
how	OO
i	OU
had	OO
to	OO
deal	OO
with	OO
too	OO
many	OO
onions	OO
as	OO
a	OO
kid	,O
growing	OO
up	OO
gay	OO
in	OO
a	OO
state	OO
where	OO
homosexuality	OO
was	OO
illegal	.O
and	OU
with	OO
that	OO
thought	,O
i	OU
could	OO
see	OO
how	OO
tightly	OO
wrapped	OO
in	OO
the	OO
tendrils	OO
of	OO
my	OO
own	OO
internalized	OO
shame	OO
i	OU
was	.O
and	OU
with	OO
that	,O
i	OU
thought	OO
about	OO
all	OO
my	OO
traumas:	OO
the	OO
violence	,O
the	OO
abuse	,O
my	OO
rape	.O
and	OU
with	OO
all	OO
that	OO
cluster	OO
of	OO
thinking	,O
a	OO
thought	,O
a	OO
question	,O
kept	OO
popping	OO
into	OO
my	OO
mind	OO
to	OO
which	OO
i	OU
had	OO
no	OO
answer:	OO
what	OU
is	OO
the	OO
purpose	OO
of	OO
my	OO
human	?O
out	OU
of	OO
anyone	OO
in	OO
my	OO

i	OU

the	OO
most	OO

to	OO
my	OO

the	OO
most	OO

these	OO

that	OO

in	OO
that	OO
grief	OO
of	OO

i	OU
could	OO
suddenly	OO
see	OO
with	OO
so	OO
much	OO
clarity	OO
just	OO
how	OO
profoundly	OO
isolated	OO
i	OU
was	OO
and	OO
always	OO
had	OO
been	.O
what	OU
was	OO
the	OO
purpose	OO
of	OO
my	OO
human	?O
i	OU
began	OO
to	OO
think	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
about	OO
how	OO
autism	OO
and	OO
ptsd	OU
have	OO
so	OO
much	OO
in	OO
common	.O
and	OU
i	OU
started	OO
to	OO
worry	,O
because	OO
i	OU
had	OO
both	.O
could	OU
i	OU
ever	OO
untangle	OO
them	?O
i'd	OU
always	OO
been	OO
told	OO
that	OO
the	OO
way	OO
out	OO
of	OO
trauma	OO
was	OO
through	OO
a	OO
cohesive	OO
narrative	.O
i	OU
had	OO
a	OO
cohesive	OO
narrative	,O
but	OO
i	OU
was	OO
still	OO
at	OO
the	OO
mercy	OO
of	OO
my	OO
traumas	.O
they're	OU
all	OO
part	OO
of	OO
my	OO
soup	,O
but	OO
the	OO
onions	OO
still	OO
stung	.O
and	OU
at	OO
that	OO
point	,O
i	OU
realized	OO
that	OO
i'd	OU
been	OO
telling	OO
my	OO
stories	OO
for	OO
laughs	.O
i'd	OU
been	OO
trimming	OO
away	OO
the	OO
darkness	,O
cutting	OO
away	OO
the	OO
pain	OO
and	OO
holding	OO
on	OO
to	OO
my	OO
trauma	OO
for	OO
the	OO
comfort	OO
of	OO
my	OO
audience	.O
i	OU
was	OO
connecting	OO
other	OO
people	OO
through	OO
laughs	,O
yet	OO
i	OU
remained	OO
profoundly	OO
disconnected	.O
what	OU
was	OO
the	OO
purpose	OO
of	OO
my	OO
human	?O
i	OU
did	OO
not	OO
have	OO
an	OO
answer	,O
but	OO
i	OU
had	OO
an	OO
idea	.O
i	OU
had	OO
an	OO
idea	OO
to	OO
tell	OO
my	OO
truth	,O
all	OO
of	OO
it	,O
not	OO
to	OO
share	OO
laughs	OO
but	OO
to	OO
share	OO
the	OO
literal	,O
visceral	OO
pain	OO
of	OO
my	OO
trauma	.O
and	OU
i	OU
thought	OO
the	OO
best	OO
way	OO
to	OO
do	OO
that	OO
would	OO
be	OO
through	OO
a	OO
comedy	OO
show	.O
and	OU
that	OO
is	OO
what	OO
i	OU
did	.O
i	OU
wrote	OO
a	OO
comedy	OO
show	OO
that	OO
did	OO
not	OO
respect	OO
the	OO
punchline	,O
that	OO
line	OO
where	OO
comedians	OO
are	OO
expected	OO
and	OO
trusted	OO
to	OO
pull	OO
their	OO
punches	OO
and	OO
turn	OO
them	OO
into	OO
tickles	.O
i	OU
did	OO
not	OO
stop	.O
i	OU
punched	OO
through	OO
that	OO
line	OO
into	OO
the	OO
metaphorical	OO
guts	OO
of	OO
my	OO
audience	.O
i	OU
did	OO
not	OO
want	OO
to	OO
make	OO
them	OO
laugh	.O
i	OU
wanted	OO
to	OO
take	OO
their	OO
breath	OO
away	,O
to	OO
shock	OO
them	,O
so	OO
they	OO
could	OO
listen	OO
to	OO
my	OO
story	OO
and	OO
hold	OO
my	OO
pain	OO
as	OO
individuals	,O
not	OO
as	OO
a	OO
mindless	,O
laughing	OO
mob	.O
and	OU
that's	OO
what	OO
i	OU
did	,O
and	OO
i	OU
called	OO
that	OO
show	OO
nanette	.U
now	,U
many	OO
—	OO
now	,U
many	OO
have	OO
argued	OO
that	OO

not	OO
a	OO

agree	OO
nanette	OU
is	OO
definitely	OO
not	OO
a	OO

those	OO
people	OO

wrong	OO

because	OO

i	OU

i	OU

you	OU

if	OO
you	OO

the	OU

simply	OO
to	OO
break	OO

the	OU
point	OO
was	OO
to	OO
break	OO

so	OO
i	OU
could	OO
rebuild	OO
it	OO

it	,O
reform	OO
it	OO
into	OO
something	OO
that	OO

better	OO

everything	OO

that	OO

what	OO
i	OU
meant	OO
when	OO

i	OU
quit	OO

now	,U
it's	OO
probably	OO
at	OO
this	OO
point	OO
where	OO
you're	OO
going	,O
yeah	,U
cool	,O
but	OO
what	OO
are	OO
the	OO
three	OO

exactly	?O
it's	OU
a	OO
bit	OO
vague	.O
i'm	OU
glad	OO
i	OU

you	OO
asked	.O
now	,U
i'm	OU
sure	OO
there's	OO
quite	OO
a	OO
few	OO
of	OO
you	OO
who	OO
have	OO
already	OO
identified	OO
three	OO
ideas	.O
a	OU
smart	OO
crowd	,O
by	OO
all	OO
accounts	,O
so	OO
i	OU
wouldn't	OO
be	OO

at	OO
all	.O
but	OU
you	OO
might	OO
be	OO
surprised	OO
to	OO
find	OO
out	OO
that	OO
i	OU
don't	OO
have	OO
three	OO
ideas	.O
i	OU

you	OO
i	OU

that	OO

a	OO

that	OU
was	OO
pure	OO

—	OO
i'm	OU
very	OO
funny	.O
what	OU
i've	OU
done	OO
instead	OO
is	OO
i've	OU
taken	OO
whole	OO
handfuls	OO
of	OO
my	OO
ideas	OO
as	OO
seeds	,O
and	OO
i've	OU
scattered	OO
them	OO
all	OO
throughout	OO
my	OO

and	OU
why	OO
did	OO
i	OU
do	OO
that	?O
well	,U
apart	OO
from	OO

and	OO
giggles	,O
it	OO
comes	OO
down	OO
to	OO
something	OO
my	OO
grandma	OO
always	OO
used	OO
to	OO
say	.O
it's	OU
not	OO
the	OO
garden	,O
it's	OO
the	OO
gardening	OO
that	OO
counts	.O
and	OU
nanette	OU
taught	OO
me	OO
the	OO
truth	OO
to	OO
that	OO
truism	.O
i	OU
fully	OO
expected	OO
by	OO
breaking	OO
the	OO
contract	OO
of	OO
comedy	OO
and	OO
telling	OO
my	OO
story	OO
in	OO
all	OO
its	OO
truth	OO
and	OO
pain	OO
that	OO
that	OO
would	OO
push	OO
me	OO
further	OO
into	OO
the	OO
margins	OO
of	OO
both	OO
life	OO
and	OO
art	.O
i	OU
expected	OO
that	,O
and	OO
i	OU
was	OO
willing	OO
to	OO
pay	OO
that	OO
cost	OO
in	OO
order	OO
to	OO
tell	OO
my	OO
truth	.O
but	OU
that	OO
is	OO
not	OO
what	OO
happened	.O
the	OU
world	OO
did	OO
not	OO
push	OO
me	OO
away	.O
it	OU
pulled	OO
me	OO
closer	.O
through	OU
an	OO
act	OO
of	OO
disconnection	,O
i	OU
found	OO
connection	.O
and	OU
it	OO
took	OO
me	OO
a	OO
long	OO
time	OO
to	OO
understand	OO
that	OO
what	OO
is	OO
at	OO
the	OO
heart	OO
of	OO
that	OO
contradiction	OO
is	OO
also	OO
at	OO
the	OO
heart	OO
of	OO
the	OO
contradiction	OO
as	OO
to	OO
why	OO
i	OU
can	OO
be	OO
so	OO
good	OO
at	OO
something	OO
i	OU

so	OO
bad	OO
at	.O
you	OU
see	,O
in	OO
the	OO
real	OO
world	,O
i	OU
struggle	OO
to	OO
talk	OO
to	OO
people	OO
because	OO
my	OO
neurodiversity	OO
makes	OO
it	OO
difficult	OO
for	OO
me	OO
to	OO
think	,O
listen	,O
speak	OO
and	OO
process	OO
new	OO
information	OO
all	OO
at	OO
the	OO

time	.O
but	OU
onstage	,O
i	OU
don't	OO
have	OO
to	OO

i	OU
prepare	OO
my	OO

well	OO
in	OO

i	OU
don't	OO

to	OO

that	OU

your	OO

i	OU
don't	OO

all	OO

with	OO
my	OO

if	OO
the	OO

anything	,O
it's	OO
that	OO

you	OU

even	OO

a	OO

of	OO
the	OO
true	OO

so	OU
what	OO
if	OO
there	OO
were	OO
a	OO
highly	OO

problem	OO
right	OO
in	OO

of	OO
you	?O
one	OU
that	OO
everyone	OO
was	OO
talking	OO
about	,O
one	OO
that	OO

you	OO

would	OU
you	OO
do	OO
everything	OO
within	OO
your	OO
power	OO
to	OO
fix	OO
things	OO
before	OO
they	OO
got	OO
worse	?O
don't	OU
be	OO
so	OO
sure	.O
we	OU
are	OO
all	OO
much	OO
more	OO
likely	OO
than	OO
any	OO
of	OO
us	OO
would	OO
like	OO
to	OO
admit	OO
to	OO
miss	OO
what's	OO
right	OO
in	OO
front	OO
of	OO
our	OO
eyes	.O
and	OU
in	OO
fact	,O
we're	OO
sometimes	OO
most	OO
likely	OO
to	OO
turn	OO
away	OO
from	OO
things	OO
precisely	OO
because	OO
of	OO
the	OO
threat	OO
that	OO
they	OO
represent	OO
to	OO
us	,O
in	OO
business	,O
life	OO
and	OO
the	OO
world	.O
so	OU
i	OU
want	OO
to	OO
give	OO
you	OO
an	OO
example	OO
from	OO
my	OO
world	,O
economic	OO
policy	.O
so	OU
when	OO
alan	OU
greenspan	OU
was	OO
head	OO
of	OO
the	OO
federal	OU
reserve	,U
his	OO
entire	OO
job	OO
was	OO
to	OO
watch	OO
out	OO
for	OO
problems	OO
in	OO
the	OO
us	OU
economy	OO
and	OO
to	OO
make	OO
sure	OO
that	OO
they	OO
didn't	OO
spin	OO
out	OO
of	OO
control	.O
so	,U
after	OO
2006	,O
when	OO
real	OO
estate	OO
prices	OO
peaked	,O
more	OO
and	OO
more	OO
and	OO
more	OO
respected	OO
leaders	OO
and	OO
institutions	OO
started	OO
to	OO
sound	OO
the	OO
alarm	OO
bells	OO
about	OO
risky	OO
lending	OO
and	OO
dangerous	OO
market	OO
bubbles	.O
as	OU
you	OO
know	,O
in	OO
2008	OO
it	OO
all	OO
came	OO
tumbling	OO
down	.O
banks	OU
collapsed	,O
global	OO
stock	OO
markets	OO
lost	OO
nearly	OO
half	OO
their	OO
value	,O
millions	OO
and	OO
millions	OO
of	OO
people	OO
lost	OO
their	OO
homes	OO
to	OO
foreclosure	.O
and	OU
at	OO
the	OO
bottom	,O
nearly	OO
one	OO
in	OO
10	OO
americans	OU
was	OO
out	OO
of	OO
work	.O
so	OU
after	OO
things	OO
calmed	OO
down	OO
a	OO
little	OO
bit	,O
greenspan	OU
and	OO
many	OO
others	OO
came	OO
out	OO
with	OO
a	OO
postmortem	OO
and	OO
said	,O
nobody	OU
could	OO
have	OO
predicted	OO
that	OO
crisis	.O
they	OU
called	OO
it	OO
a	OO
black	OO
swan	.O
something	OU
that	OO
was	OO
unimaginable	,O
unforeseeable	OO
and	OO
completely	OO
improbable	.O
a	OU
total	OO
surprise	.O
except	OU
it	OO
wasn't	OO
always	OO
such	OO
a	OO
surprise	.O
for	OU
example	,O
my	OO
manhattan	OU
apartment	OO
nearly	OO
doubled	OO
in	OO
value	OO
in	OO
less	OO
than	OO
four	OO
years	.O
i	OU
saw	OO
the	OO
writing	OO
on	OO
the	OO
wall	OO
and	OO
i	OU
sold	OO
it	.O
so	,U
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
other	OO
people	OO
also	OO
saw	OO
the	OO
warning	,O
spoke	OO
out	OO
publicly	OO
and	OO
they	OO
were	OO
ignored	.O
so	OU
we	OO
didn't	OO
know	OO
exactly	OO
what	OO
the	OO
crisis	OO
was	OO
going	OO
to	OO
look	OO
like	,O
not	OO
the	OO
exact	OO
parameters	,O
but	OO
we	OO
could	OO
all	OO
tell	OO
that	OO
the	OO
thing	OO
coming	OO
at	OO
us	OO
was	OO
as	OO
dangerous	,O
visible	OO
and	OO
predictable	OO
as	OO
a	OO
giant	OO
gray	OO
rhino	OO
charging	OO
right	OO
at	OO
us	.O
the	OU
black	OO
swan	OO
lends	OO
itself	OO
to	OO
the	OO
idea	OO
that	OO
we	OO
don't	OO
have	OO
power	OO
over	OO
our	OO
futures	.O
and	OU
unfortunately	,O
the	OO
less	OO
control	OO
that	OO
we	OO
think	OO
we	OO
have	,O
the	OO
more	OO
likely	OO
we	OO
are	OO
to	OO
downplay	OO
it	OO
or	OO
ignore	OO
it	OO
entirely	.O
and	OU
this	OO
dangerous	OO
dynamic	OO
masks	OO
another	OO
problem:	OO
that	OO
most	OO
of	OO
the	OO
problems	OO
that	OO
we're	OO
facing	OO
are	OO
so	OO
probable	OO
and	OO
obvious	,O
they're	OO
things	OO
that	OO
we	OO
can	OO
see	,O
but	OO
we	OO
still	OO
don't	OO
do	OO
anything	OO
about	.O
so	OU
i	OU
created	OO
the	OO
gray	OO
rhino	OO
metaphor	OO
to	OO
meet	OO
what	OO
i	OU
felt	OO
was	OO
an	OO
urgent	OO
need	.O
to	OU
help	OO
us	OO
to	OO
take	OO
a	OO
fresh	OO
look	,O
with	OO
the	OO
same	OO
passion	OO
that	OO
people	OO
had	OO
for	OO
the	OO
black	OO
swan	,O
but	OO
this	OO
time	,O
for	OO
the	OO
things	OO
that	OO
were	OO
highly	OO
obvious	,O
highly	OO
probable	,O
but	OO
still	OO
neglected	.O
those	OU
are	OO
the	OO
gray	OO
rhinos	.O
once	OU
you	OO
start	OO
looking	OO
for	OO
gray	OO
rhinos	,O
you	OO
see	OO
them	OO
in	OO
the	OO
headlines	OO
every	OO
day	.O
and	OU
so	OO
what	OO
i	OU
see	OO
in	OO
the	OO
headlines	OO
is	OO
another	OO
big	OO
gray	OO
rhino	,O
a	OO
new	OO
highly	OO
probable	OO
financial	OO
crisis	.O
and	OU
i	OU
wonder	OO
if	OO
we've	OO
learned	OO
anything	OO
in	OO
the	OO
last	OO
10	OO
years	.O
so	OU
if	OO
you	OO
listen	OO
to	OO
washington	OU
or	OO

you	OO
could	OO
almost	OO
be	OO
forgiven	OO
for	OO

that	OO
only	OO

but	OU
in	OO
china	,U
where	OO
i	OU
spend	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO

the	OO

the	OU

all	OO
the	OO

about	OO

how	OO
they	OO

them	.O
now	,U
to	OO

china	OU
and	OO
the	OO

very	,O
very	OO
different	OO

which	OO

but	OU
it's	OO
no	OO
secret	OO
that	OO
both	OO
countries	OO
have	OO
problems	OO
with	OO
debt	,O
with	OO
inequality	OO
and	OO
with	OO
economic	OO
productivity	.O
so	OU
how	OO
come	OO
the	OO
conversations	OO
are	OO
so	OO
different	?O
you	OU
could	OO
actually	OO
ask	OO
this	OO
question	,O
not	OO
just	OO
about	OO
countries	,O
but	OO
about	OO
just	OO
about	OO
everyone	.O
the	OU
auto	OO
companies	OO
that	OO
put	OO
safety	OO
first	OO
and	OO
the	OO
ones	OO
that	OO
don't	OO
bother	OO
to	OO
recall	OO
their	OO
shoddy	OO
cars	OO
until	OO
after	OO
people	OO
die	.O
the	OU
grandparents	OO
who	,O
in	OO
preparing	OO
for	OO
the	OO
inevitable	OO
—	OO
the	OO
ones	OO
who	OO
have	OO
the	OO
eulogy	OO
written	,O
the	OO
menu	OO
for	OO
the	OO
funeral	OO
lunch	.O
my	OU
grandparents	OO
did	.O
and	OU
everything	OO
but	OO
the	OO
final	OO
date	OO
chiseled	OO
into	OO
the	OO
gravestone	.O
but	OU
then	OO
you	OO
have	OO
the	OO
grandparents	OO
on	OO
the	OO
other	OO
side	,O
who	OO
don't	OO
put	OO
their	OO
final	OO
affairs	OO
in	OO
order	,O
who	OO
don't	OO
get	OO
rid	OO
of	OO
all	OO
the	OO
junk	OO
they've	OO
been	OO
hoarding	OO
for	OO
decades	OO
and	OO
decades	OO
and	OO
leave	OO
their	OO
kids	OO
to	OO
deal	OO
with	OO
it	.O
so	OU
what	OO
makes	OO
the	OO
difference	OO
between	OO
one	OO
side	OO
and	OO
the	OO
other	?O
why	OU
do	OO
some	OO
people	OO
see	OO
things	OO
and	OO
deal	OO
with	OO
them	,O
and	OO
the	OO
other	OO
ones	OO
just	OO
look	OO
away	?O
so	OU
the	OO
first	OO
one	OO
has	OO
to	OO
do	OO
with	OO
culture	,O
society	,O
the	OO
people	OO
around	OO
you	.O
if	OU
you	OO
think	OO
that	OO
someone	OO
around	OO
you	OO
is	OO
going	OO
to	OO
help	OO
pick	OO
you	OO
up	OO
when	OO
you	OO
fall	,O
you're	OO
much	OO
more	OO
likely	OO
to	OO
see	OO
a	OO
danger	OO
as	OO
being	OO
smaller	.O
and	OU
that	OO
allows	OO
us	OO
to	OO
take	OO
good	OO
chances	,O
not	OO
just	OO
the	OO
bad	OO
ones	.O
for	OU
example	,O
like	OO
risking	OO
criticism	OO
when	OO
you	OO
talk	OO
about	OO
the	OO
danger	OO
that	OO
nobody	OO
wants	OO
you	OO
to	OO
talk	OO
about	.O
or	OU
taking	OO
the	OO
opportunities	OO
that	OO
are	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
scary	,O
so	OO
in	OO
their	OO
own	OO
way	OO
are	OO
gray	OO
rhinos	.O
so	OU
the	OO
us	OU
has	OO
a	OO
very	OO
individualist	OO
culture	OO
—	OO
go	OO
it	OO
alone	.O
and	OU
paradoxically	,O
this	OO
makes	OO
many	OO
americans	OU
much	OO
less	OO
open	OO
to	OO
change	OO
and	OO
taking	OO
good	OO
risks	.O
in	OU
china	,U
by	OO
contrast	,O
people	OO
believe	OO
that	OO
the	OO
government	OO
is	OO
going	OO
to	OO
keep	OO
problems	OO
from	OO
happening	,O
which	OO
might	OO
not	OO
always	OO
be	OO
what	OO
happens	,O
but	OO
people	OO
believe	OO
it	.O
they	OU
believe	OO
they	OO
can	OO
rely	OO
on	OO
their	OO
families	,O
so	OO
that	OO
makes	OO
them	OO
more	OO
likely	OO
to	OO
take	OO
certain	OO
risks	.O
like	OU
buying	OO
beijing	OU
real	OO
estate	,O
or	OO
like	OO
being	OO
more	OO
open	OO
about	OO
the	OO
fact	OO
that	OO
they	OO
need	OO
to	OO
change	OO
direction	,O
and	OO
in	OO
fact	,O
the	OO
pace	OO
of	OO
change	OO
in	OO
china	OU
is	OO
absolutely	OO
amazing	.O
second	OU
of	OO
all	,O
how	OO
much	OO
do	OO
you	OO
know	OO
about	OO
a	OO
situation	,O
how	OO
much	OO
are	OO
you	OO
willing	OO
to	OO

you	OO
willing	OO
to	OO
see	OO
things	OO
even	OO
when	OO
it's	OO
not	OO
what	OO
you	OO
want	?O
so	OU
many	OO
of	OO
us	OO
are	OO
so	OO
unlikely	OO
to	OO
pay	OO
attention	OO
to	OO
the	OO
things	OO
that	OO
we	OO
just	OO
want	OO
to	OO
black	OO
out	,O
we	OO

we	OU
pay	OO

what	OO
we	OO
want	OO
to	OO
see	,O
what	OO
we	OO

what	OO
we	OO
agree	OO
with	.O
but	OU
we	OO
have	OO
the	OO
opportunity	OO
and	OO
the	OO
ability	OO
to	OO
correct	OO
those	OO
blind	OO
spots	.O
i	OU
spend	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
time	OO
talking	OO
with	OO
people	OO
of	OO
all	OO
walks	OO
of	OO
life	OO
about	OO
the	OO
gray	OO
rhinos	OO
in	OO
their	OO
life	OO
and	OO
their	OO
attitudes	.O
and	OU
you	OO
might	OO
think	OO
that	OO
the	OO
people	OO
who	OO
are	OO
more	OO
afraid	OO
of	OO
risk	,O
who	OO
are	OO
more	OO
sensitive	OO
to	OO
them	,O
would	OO
be	OO
the	OO
ones	OO
who	OO
would	OO
be	OO
less	OO
open	OO
to	OO
change	.O
but	OU
the	OO
opposite	OO
is	OO
actually	OO
true	.O
i've	OU
found	OO
that	OO
the	OO
people	OO
who	OO
are	OO
wiling	OO
to	OO
recognize	OO
the	OO
problems	OO
around	OO
them	OO
and	OO
make	OO
plans	OO
are	OO
the	OO
ones	OO
who	OO
are	OO
able	OO
to	OO
tolerate	OO
more	OO
risk	,O
good	OO
risk	,O
and	OO
deal	OO
with	OO
the	OO
bad	OO
risk	.O
and	OU
it's	OO
because	OO
as	OO
we	OO
seek	OO
information	,O
we	OO
increase	OO
our	OO
power	OO
to	OO
do	OO
something	OO
about	OO
the	OO
things	OO
that	OO
we're	OO
afraid	OO
of	.O
and	OU
that	OO
brings	OO
me	OO
to	OO
my	OO
third	OO
point	.O
how	OU
much	OO
control	OO
do	OO
you	OO
feel	OO
that	OO
you	OO
have	OO
over	OO
the	OO
gray	OO
rhinos	OO
in	OO
your	OO
life	?O
one	OU
of	OO
the	OO
reasons	OO
we	OO
don't	OO
act	OO
is	OO
that	OO
we	OO
often	OO
feel	OO
too	OO
helpless	.O
think	OU
of	OO
climate	OO
change	,O
it	OO
can	OO
feel	OO
so	OO
big	,O
that	OO
not	OO
a	OO
single	OO
one	OO
of	OO
us	OO
could	OO
make	OO
a	OO
difference	.O
so	OU
some	OO
people	OO
go	OO
about	OO
life	OO
denying	OO
it	.O
other	OU
people	OO
blame	OO
everyone	OO
except	OO
themselves	.O
like	OU
my	OO
friend	OO
who	OO
says	OO
he's	OO
not	OO
ever	OO
going	OO
to	OO
give	OO
up	OO
his	OO
suv	OU
until	OO
they	OO
stop	OO
building	OO
coal	OO

in	OO
china	.U
but	OU
we	OO
have	OO
an	OO
opportunity	OO
to	OO

no	OU
two	OO
of	OO
us	OO
are	OO
the	OO

every	OU

one	OO
of	OO
us	OO
has	OO
the	OO
opportunity	OO
to	OO
change	OO
our	OO
attitudes	,O
our	OO
own	OO
and	OO
those	OO
of	OO
people	OO
around	OO
us	.O
so	OU
today	,O
i	OU
want	OO
to	OO
invite	OO
all	OO
of	OO
you	OO
to	OO
join	OO
me	OO
in	OO
helping	OO
to	OO
spark	OO
an	OO
open	OO
and	OO
honest	OO
conversation	OO
with	OO
the	OO
people	OO
around	OO
you	,O
about	OO
the	OO
gray	OO
rhinos	OO
in	OO
our	OO
world	,O
and	OO
be	OO
brutally	OO
honest	OO
about	OO
how	OO
well	OO
we're	OO
dealing	OO
with	OO
them	.O
i	OU
hear	OO
so	OO
many	OO
times	OO
in	OO
the	OO
states	,U
well	,U
of	OO
course	OO
we	OO
should	OO
deal	OO
with	OO
obvious	OO
problems	,O
but	OO
if	OO
you	OO
don't	OO
see	OO
what's	OO
in	OO

of	OO
you	,O
you're	OO
either	OO
dumb	OO
or	OO
ignorant	.O
that's	OU
what	OO
they	OO
say	,O
and	OO
i	OU
could	OO
not	OO
disagree	OO
more	.O
if	OU
you	OO
don't	OO
see	OO
what's	OO
in	OO

of	OO
you	,O
you're	OO
not	OO
dumb	,O
you're	OO
not	OO

you're	OO
human	.O
and	OU
once	OO
we	OO
all	OO
recognize	OO
that	OO

vulnerability	,O
that	OO
gives	OO
us	OO
the	OO
power	OO
to	OO
open	OO
our	OO
eyes	,O
to	OO
see	OO
what's	OO
in	OO
front	OO
of	OO
us	OO
and	OO
to	OO
act	OO
before	OO
we	OO
get	OO
trampled	.O
i	OU
recently	OO
had	OO
an	OO
epiphany	.O
i	OU
realized	OO
that	OO
i	OU
could	OO
actually	OO
play	OO
a	OO
role	OO
in	OO
solving	OO
one	OO
of	OO
the	OO
biggest	OO
problems	OO
that	OO
faces	OO
mankind	OO
today	,O
and	OO
that	OO
is	OO
the	OO
problem	OO
of	OO
climate	OO
change	.O
it	OU
also	OO
dawned	OO
on	OO
me	OO
that	OO
i	OU
had	OO
been	OO
working	OO
for	OO
30	OO
years	OO
or	OO
more	OO
just	OO
to	OO
get	OO
to	OO
this	OO
point	OO
in	OO
my	OO
life	OO
where	OO
i	OU
could	OO
actually	OO
make	OO
this	OO
contribution	OO
to	OO
a	OO
bigger	OO
problem	.O
and	OU
every	OO
experiment	OO
that	OO
i	OU
have	OO
done	OO
in	OO
my	OO
lab	OO
over	OO
the	OO
last	OO
30	OO
years	OO
and	OO
people	OO
who	OO
work	OO
for	OO
me	OO
did	OO
in	OO
my	OO
lab	OO
over	OO
the	OO
last	OO
30	OO
years	OO
has	OO
been	OO
directed	OO
toward	OO
doing	OO
the	OO
really	OO
big	OO
experiment	,O
this	OO
one	OO
last	OO
big	OO
experiment	.O
so	OU
who	OO
am	OO
i	?U
i'm	OU
a	OO
plant	OO
geneticist	.O
i	OU
live	OO
in	OO
a	OO
world	OO
where	OO
there's	OO
too	OO
much	OO
co2	OU
in	OO
the	OO
atmosphere	OO
because	OO
of	OO
human	OO
activity	.O
but	OU
i've	OU
come	OO
to	OO
appreciate	OO
the	OO
plants	OO
as	OO
amazing	OO
machines	OO
that	OO
they	OO
are	,O
whose	OO
job	OO
has	OO
been	,O
really	,O
to	OO
just	OO
suck	OO
up	OO
co2	.U
and	OU
they	OO
do	OO
it	OO
so	OO
well	,O
because	OO
they've	OO
been	OO
doing	OO
it	OO
for	OO
over	OO
500	OO
million	OO
years	.O
and	OU
they're	OO
really	OO
good	OO
at	OO
it	.O
and	OU
so	.O
i	OU
also	OO
have	OO
some	OO
urgency	OO
i	OU
want	OO
to	OO
tell	OO
you	OO
about	.O
as	OU
a	OO
mother	,O
i	OU
want	OO
to	OO
give	OO
my	OO
two	OO
children	OO
a	OO
better	OO
world	OO
than	OO
i	OU
inherited	OO
from	OO
my	OO
parents	,O
it	OO
would	OO
be	OO
nicer	OO
to	OO
keep	OO
it	OO
going	OO
in	OO
the	OO
right	OO
direction	,O
not	OO
the	OO
bad	OO
direction	.O
but	OU
i	OU
also	.O
i've	OU
had	OO
parkinson's	OU
for	OO
the	OO
last	OO
15	OO
years	,O
and	OO
this	OO
gives	OO
me	OO
a	OO
sense	OO
of	OO
urgency	OO
that	OO
i	OU
want	OO
to	OO
do	OO
this	OO
now	,O
while	OO
i	OU
feel	OO
good	OO
enough	OO
to	OO
really	OO
be	OO
part	OO
of	OO
this	OO
team	.O
and	OU
i	OU
have	OO
an	OO
incredible	OO
team	.O
we	OU
all	OO
work	OO
together	,O
and	OO
this	OO
is	OO
something	OO
we	OO
want	OO
to	OO
do	OO
because	OO
we	OO
have	OO
fun	.O
and	OU
if	OO
you're	OO
only	OO
going	OO
to	OO
have	OO
five	OO
people	OO
trying	OO
to	OO
save	OO
the	OO
planet	,O
you	OO
better	OO
like	OO
each	OO
other	,O
because	OO
you're	OO
going	OO
to	OO
be	OO
spending	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
time	OO
together	.O
ok	,U
alright	.O
but	OU
enough	OO
about	OO
me	.O
let's	OU
talk	OO
about	OO
co2	.U
co2	OU
is	OO
the	OO
star	OO
of	OO
my	OO
talk	.O
now	,U
most	OO
of	OO
you	OO
probably	OO
think	OO
of	OO
co2	OU
as	OO
a	OO
pollutant	.O
or	OU
perhaps	OO
you	OO
think	OO
of	OO
co2	OU
as	OO
the	OO
villain	OO
in	OO
the	OO
novel	,O
you	OO
know	?O
it's	OU
always	OO
the	OO
dark	OO
side	OO
of	OO
co2	.U
but	OU
as	OO
a	OO
plant	OO
biologist	,O
i	OU
see	OO
the	OO
other	OO
side	OO
of	OO
co2	,U
actually	.O
and	OU
that	OO
co2	OU
that	OO
we	OO
see	,O
we	OO
see	OO
it	OO
differently	OO
because	OO
i	OU
think	OO
we	OO
remember	,O
as	OO
plant	OO
biologists	,O
something	OO
you	OO
may	OO
have	OO
forgotten	.O
and	OU
that	OO
is	OO
that	OO
plants	OO
actually	OO
do	OO
this	OO
process	OO
called	OO
photosynthesis	.O
and	OU
when	OO
they	OO
do	OO
photosynthesis	OO
—	OO
all	OO
carbon	OO
based	OO
life	OO
on	OO
our	OO
earth	OO
is	OO
all	OO
because	OO
of	OO
the	OO
co2	OU
that	OO
plants	OO
and	OO
other	OO
photosynthetic	OO
microbes	OO
have	OO
dragged	OO
in	OO
from	OO
co2	OU
that	OO
was	OO
in	OO
the	OO
atmosphere	.O
and	OU
almost	OO
all	OO
of	OO
the	OO
carbon	OO
in	OO
your	OO
body	OO
came	OO
from	OO
air	,O
basically	.O
so	OU
you	OO
come	OO
from	OO
air	,O
and	OO
it's	OO
because	OO
of	OO
photosynthesis	,O
because	OO
what	OO
plants	OO
do	OO
is	OO
they	OO
use	OO
the	OO
energy	OO
in	OO
sunlight	,O
take	OO
that	OO
co2	OU
and	OO
fix	OO
it	OO
into	OO
sugars	.O
it's	OU
a	OO
great	OO
thing	.O
and	OU
the	OO
other	OO
thing	OO
that	OO
is	OO
really	OO
important	OO
for	OO
what	OO
i'm	OU
going	OO
to	OO
tell	OO
you	OO
today	OO
is	OO
that	OO
plants	OO
and	OO
other	OO
photosynthetic	OO
microbes	OO
have	OO
a	OO
great	OO
capacity	OO
for	OO
doing	OO
this	OO
—	OO
twentyfold	OO
or	OO
more	OO
than	OO
the	OO
amount	OO
of	OO
co2	OU
that	OO
we	OO
put	OO
up	OO
because	OO
of	OO
our	OO
human	OO
activities	.O
and	OU
so	,O
even	OO
though	OO
we're	OO
not	OO
doing	OO
a	OO
great	OO
job	OO
at	OO
cutting	OO
our	OO
emissions	OO
and	OO
things	,O
plants	OO
have	OO
the	OO
capacity	,O
as	OO
photosynthetic	OO
organisms	,O
to	OO
help	OO
out	.O
so	OU
we're	OO
hoping	OO
that's	OO
what	OO
they'll	OO
do	.O
but	OU
there's	OO
a	OO
catch	OO
here	.O
we	OU
have	OO
to	OO
help	OO
the	OO
plants	OO
a	OO
little	OO
ourselves	,O
because	OO
what	OO
plants	OO
like	OO
to	OO
do	OO
is	OO
put	OO
most	OO
of	OO
the	OO
co2	OU
into	OO
sugars	.O
and	OU
when	OO
the	OO
end	OO
of	OO
the	OO
growing	OO
season	OO
comes	,O
the	OO
plant	OO
dies	OO
and	OO
decomposes	,O
and	OO
then	OO
all	OO
that	OO
work	OO
they	OO
did	OO
to	OO
suck	OO
out	OO
the	OO
co2	OU
from	OO
the	OO
atmosphere	OO
and	OO
make	OO
carbon	OO
based	OO
biomass	OO
is	OO
now	OO
basically	OO
going	OO
right	OO
back	OO
up	OO
in	OO
the	OO
atmosphere	OO
as	OO
co2	.U
so	OU
how	OO
can	OO
we	OO
get	OO
plants	OO
to	OO
redistribute	OO
the	OO
co2	OU
they	OO
bring	OO
in	OO
into	OO
something	OO
that's	OO
a	OO
little	OO
more	OO
stable	?O
and	OU
so	OO
it	OO
turns	OO
out	OO
that	OO
plants	OO
make	OO
this	OO
product	,O
and	OO
it's	OO
called	OO
suberin	.O
this	OU
is	OO
a	OO
natural	OO
product	OO
that	OO
is	OO
in	OO
all	OO
plant	OO
roots	.O
and	OU
suberin	OO
is	OO
really	OO
cool	,O
because	OO
as	OO
you	OO
can	OO
see	OO
there	,O
i	OU
hope	,O
everywhere	OO
you	OO
see	OO
a	OO
black	OO
dot	,O
that's	OO
a	OO
carbon	.O
there's	OU
hundreds	OO
of	OO
them	OO
in	OO
this	OO
molecule	.O
and	OU
where	OO
you	OO
see	OO
those	OO
few	OO
red	OO
dots	,O
those	OO
are	OO
oxygens	.O
and	OU
oxygen	OO
is	OO
what	OO
microbes	OO
like	OO
to	OO
find	OO
so	OO
they	OO
can	OO
decompose	OO
a	OO
plant	.O
so	OU
you	OO
can	OO
see	OO
why	OO
this	OO
is	OO
a	OO
perfect	OO
carbon	OO
storage	OO
device	.O
and	OU
actually	OO
it	OO
can	OO
stabilize	OO
the	OO
carbon	OO
that	OO
gets	OO
fixed	OO
by	OO
the	OO
plant	OO
into	OO
something	OO
that's	OO
a	OO
little	OO
bit	OO
better	OO
for	OO
the	OO
plant	.O
and	OU
so	,O
why	OO
now	?O
why	OU
is	OO
now	OO
a	OO
good	OO
time	OO
to	OO
do	OO
a	OO
biological	OO
solution	OO
to	OO
this	OO
problem	?O
it's	OU
because	OO
over	OO
the	OO
last	OO
30	OO
or	OO
so	OO
years	OO
—	OO
and	OO
i	OU
know	OO
that's	OO
a	OO
long	OO
time	,O
you're	OO
saying	,O
why	OU
now	?O
—	OO
but	OO
30	OO
years	OO
ago	,O
we	OO
began	OO
to	OO
understand	OO
the	OO
functions	OO
of	OO
all	OO
the	OO
genes	OO
that	OO
are	OO
in	OO
an	OO
organism	OO
in	OO
general	.O
and	OU
that	OO
included	OO
humans	OO
as	OO
well	OO
as	OO
plants	OO
and	OO
many	OO
other	OO
complicated	OO
eukaryotes	.O
and	OU
so	,O
what	OO
did	OO
the	OO
1980s	OO
begin	?O
what	OU
began	OO
then	OO
is	OO
that	OO
we	OO
now	OO
know	OO
the	OO
function	OO
of	OO
many	OO
of	OO
the	OO
genes	OO
that	OO
are	OO
in	OO
a	OO
plant	OO
that	OO
tell	OO
a	OO
plant	OO
to	OO
grow	.O
and	OU
that	OO
has	OO
now	OO
converged	OO
with	OO
the	OO
fact	OO
that	OO
we	OO
can	OO
do	OO
genomics	OO
in	OO
a	OO
faster	OO
and	OO
cheaper	OO
way	OO
than	OO
we	OO
ever	OO
did	OO
before	.O
and	OU
what	OO
that	OO
tells	OO
us	OO
is	OO
that	OO
all	OO
life	OO
on	OO
earth	OO
is	OO
really	OO
related	,O
but	OO
plants	OO
are	OO
more	OO
related	OO
to	OO
each	OO
other	OO
than	OO
other	OO
organisms	.O
and	OU
that	OO
you	OO
can	OO
take	OO
a	OO
trait	OO
that	OO
you	OO
know	OO
from	OO
one	OO
plant	OO
and	OO
put	OO
it	OO
in	OO
another	OO
plant	,O
and	OO
you	OO
can	OO
make	OO
a	OO
prediction	OO
that	OO
it'll	OO
do	OO
the	OO
same	OO
thing	.O
and	OU
so	OO
that's	OO
important	OO
as	OO
well	.O
then	OU
finally	,O
we	OO
have	OO
these	OO
little	OO
genetic	OO
tricks	OO
that	OO
came	OO
along	,O
like	OO
you	OO
heard	OO
about	OO
this	OO
morning	OO
—	OO
things	OO
like	OO
crispr	,U
that	OO
allows	OO
us	OO
to	OO
do	OO
editing	OO
and	OO
make	OO
genes	OO
be	OO
a	OO
little	OO
different	OO
from	OO
the	OO
normal	OO
state	OO
in	OO
the	OO
plant	.O
ok	,U
so	OO
now	OO
we	OO
have	OO
biology	OO
on	OO
our	OO
side	.O
i'm	OU
a	OO
biologist	,O
so	OO
that's	OO
why	OO
i'm	OU
proposing	OO
a	OO
solution	OO
to	OO
the	OO
climate	OO
change	OO
problem	OO
that	OO
really	OO
involves	OO
the	OO
best	OO
evolved	OO
organism	OO
on	OO
earth	OO
to	OO
do	OO
it	OO
—	OO
plants	.O
so	OU
how	OO
are	OO
we	OO
going	OO
to	OO
do	OO
it	?O
biology	OU
comes	OO
to	OO
the	OO
rescue	.O
here	OU
we	OO
go	.O
ok	.U
you	OU
have	OO
to	OO
remember	OO
three	OO
simple	OO
things	OO
from	OO
my	OO
talk	,O
ok	?U
we	OU
have	OO
to	OO
get	OO
plants	OO
to	OO
make	OO
more	OO
suberin	OO
than	OO
they	OO
normally	OO
make	,O
because	OO
we	OO
need	OO
them	OO
to	OO
be	OO
a	OO
little	OO
better	OO
than	OO
what	OO
they	OO
are	.O
we	OU
have	OO
to	OO
get	OO
them	OO
to	OO
make	OO
more	OO
roots	,O
because	OO
if	OO
we	OO
make	OO
more	OO
roots	,O
we	OO
can	OO
make	OO
more	OO
suberin	OO
—	OO
now	OO
we	OO
have	OO
more	OO
of	OO
the	OO
cells	OO
that	OO
suberin	OO
likes	OO
to	OO
accumulate	OO
in	.O
and	OU
then	OO
the	OO
third	OO
thing	OO
is	,O
we	OO
want	OO
the	OO
plants	OO
to	OO
have	OO
deeper	OO
roots	.O
and	OU
what	OO
that	OO
does	OO
is	OO
—	OO
we're	OO
asking	OO
the	OO
plant	,O
actually	,O
ok	,U
make	OO
stable	OO
carbon	,O
more	OO
than	OO
you	OO
used	OO
to	,O
and	OO
then	OO
bury	OO
it	OO
for	OO
us	OO
in	OO
the	OO
ground	.O
so	OU
they	OO
can	OO
do	OO
that	OO
if	OO
they	OO
make	OO
roots	OO
that	OO
go	OO
deep	OO
rather	OO
than	OO
meander	OO
around	OO
on	OO
the	OO
surface	OO
of	OO
the	OO
soil	.O
those	OU
are	OO
the	OO
three	OO
traits	OO
we	OO
want	OO
to	OO
change:	OO
more	OO
suberin	,O
more	OO
roots	,O
and	OO
the	OO
last	OO
one	,O
deep	OO
roots	.O
then	OU
we	OO
want	OO
to	OO
combine	OO
all	OO
those	OO
traits	OO
in	OO
one	OO
plant	,O
and	OO
we	OO
can	OO
do	OO
that	OO
easily	OO
and	OO
we	OO
will	OO
do	OO
it	,O
and	OO
we	OO
are	OO
doing	OO
it	OO
actually	,O
in	OO
the	OO
model	OO
plant	,O
arabidopsis	,U
which	OO
allows	OO
us	OO
to	OO
do	OO
these	OO
experiments	OO
much	OO
faster	OO
than	OO
we	OO
can	OO
do	OO
in	OO
another	OO
big	OO
plant	.O
and	OU
when	OO
we	OO
find	OO
that	OO
we	OO
have	OO
plants	OO
where	OO
traits	OO
all	OO
add	OO
up	OO
and	OO
we	OO
can	OO
get	OO
more	OO
of	OO
them	,O
more	OO
suberin	OO
in	OO
those	OO
plants	,O
we're	OO
going	OO
to	OO
move	OO
it	OO
all	OO
—	OO
we	OO
can	OO
and	OO
we	OO
we	OO
will	,O
we're	OO
beginning	OO
to	OO
do	OO
this	OO
—	OO
move	OO
it	OO
to	OO
crop	OO
plants	.O
and	OU
i'll	OU
tell	OO
you	OO
why	OO
we're	OO
picking	OO
crop	OO
plants	OO
to	OO
do	OO
the	OO
work	OO
for	OO
us	OO
when	OO
i	OU
get	OO
to	OO
that	OO
part	OO
of	OO
my	OO
talk	.O
ok	,U
so	OO
i	OU
think	OO
this	OO
is	OO
the	OO
science	OO
behind	OO
the	OO
whole	OO
thing	.O
and	OU
so	OO
i	OU
know	OO
we	OO
can	OO
do	OO
the	OO
science	,O
i	OU
feel	OO
pretty	OO
confident	OO
about	OO
that	.O
and	OU
the	OO
reason	OO
is	OO
because	,O
just	OO
in	OO
the	OO
last	OO
year	,O
we've	OO
been	OO
able	OO
to	OO
find	OO
single	OO
genes	OO
that	OO
affect	OO
each	OO
of	OO
those	OO
three	OO
traits	.O
and	OU
in	OO
several	OO
of	OO
those	OO
cases	,O
two	OO
out	OO
of	OO
the	OO
three	,O
we	OO
have	OO
more	OO
than	OO
one	OO
way	OO
to	OO
get	OO
there	.O
so	OU
that	OO
tells	OO
us	OO
we	OO
might	OO
be	OO
able	OO
to	OO
even	OO
combine	OO
within	OO
a	OO
trait	OO
and	OO
get	OO
even	OO
more	OO
suberin	.O
this	OU
shows	OO
one	OO
result	,O
where	OO
we	OO
have	OO
a	OO
plant	OO
here	OO
on	OO
the	OO
right	OO
that's	OO
making	OO
more	OO
than	OO
double	OO
the	OO
amount	OO
of	OO
root	OO
than	OO
the	OO
plant	OO
on	OO
the	OO
left	,O
and	OO
that's	OO
just	OO
because	OO
of	OO
the	OO
way	OO
we	OO
expressed	OO
one	OO
gene	OO
that's	OO
normally	OO
in	OO
the	OO
plant	OO
in	OO
a	OO
slightly	OO
different	OO
way	OO
than	OO
the	OO
plant	OO
usually	OO
does	OO
on	OO
its	OO
own	.O
alright	,U
so	OO
that's	OO
just	OO
one	OO
example	OO
i	OU
wanted	OO
to	OO
show	OO
you	.O
and	OU
now	OO
i	OU
want	OO
to	OO
tell	OO
you	OO
that	,O
you	OO
know	,O
we	OO
still	OO
have	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
challenges	,O
actually	,O
when	OO
we	OO
get	OO
to	OO
this	OO
problem	,O
because	OO
it	OO
takes	.O
we	OU
have	OO
to	OO
get	OO
the	OO
farmers	OO
to	OO
actually	OO
buy	OO
the	OO
seeds	,O
or	OO
at	OO
least	OO
the	OO
seed	OO
company	OO
to	OO
buy	OO
seeds	OO
that	OO
farmers	OO
are	OO
going	OO
to	OO
want	OO
to	OO
have	.O
and	OU
so	OO
when	OO
we	OO
do	OO
the	OO
experiments	,O
we	OO
can't	OO
actually	OO
take	OO
a	OO
loss	OO
in	OO
yield	,O
because	OO
while	OO
we	OO
are	OO
doing	OO
these	OO
experiments	,O
say	,O
beginning	OO
about	OO
10	OO
years	OO
from	OO
now	,O
the	OO
earth's	OO
population	OO
will	OO
be	OO
even	OO
more	OO
than	OO
it	OO
is	OO
right	OO
now	.O
and	OU
it's	OO
rapidly	OO
growing	OO
still	.O
so	OU
by	OO
the	OO
end	OO
of	OO
the	OO
century	,O
we	OO
have	OO
11	OO
billion	OO
people	,O
we	OO
have	OO
wasted	OO
ecosystems	OO
that	OO
aren't	OO
really	OO
going	OO
to	OO
be	OO
able	OO
to	OO
handle	OO
all	OO
the	OO
load	OO
they	OO
have	OO
to	OO
take	OO
from	OO
agriculture	.O
and	OU
then	OO
we	OO
also	OO
have	OO
this	OO
competition	OO
for	OO
land	.O
and	OU
so	OO
we	OO
figure	,O
to	OO
do	OO
this	OO
carbon	OO
sequestration	OO
experiment	OO
actually	OO
requires	OO
a	OO
fair	OO
amount	OO
of	OO
land	.O
we	OU
can't	OO
take	OO
it	OO
away	OO
from	OO
food	,O
because	OO
we	OO
have	OO
to	OO
feed	OO
the	OO
people	OO
that	OO
are	OO
also	OO
going	OO
to	OO
be	OO
on	OO
the	OO
earth	OO
until	OO
we	OO
get	OO
past	OO
this	OO
big	OO
crisis	.O
and	OU
the	OO
climate	OO
change	OO
is	OO
actually	OO
causing	OO
loss	OO
of	OO
yield	OO
all	OO
over	OO
the	OO
earth	.O
so	OU
why	OO
would	OO
farmers	OO
want	OO
to	OO
buy	OO
seeds	OO
if	OO
it's	OO
going	OO
to	OO
impact	OO
yield	?O
so	OU
we're	OO
not	OO
going	OO
to	OO
let	OO
it	OO
impact	OO
yield	,O
we're	OO
going	OO
to	OO
always	OO
have	OO
checks	OO
and	OO
balances	OO
that	OO
says	OO
go	OO
or	OO
no	OO
go	OO
on	OO
that	OO
experiment	.O
and	OU
then	OO
the	OO
second	OO
thing	OO
is	,O
when	OO
a	OO
plant	OO
actually	OO
makes	OO
more	OO
carbon	OO
and	OO
buries	OO
it	OO
in	OO
the	OO
soil	OO
like	OO
that	,O
almost	OO
all	OO
the	OO
soils	OO
on	OO
earth	OO
are	OO
actually	OO
depleted	OO
of	OO
carbon	OO
because	OO
of	OO
the	OO
load	OO
from	OO
agriculture	,O
trying	OO
to	OO
feed	OO
eight	OO
billion	OO
people	,O
which	OO
is	OO
what	OO
lives	OO
on	OO
the	OO
earth	OO
right	OO
now	.O
and	OU
so	,O
that	OO
is	OO
also	OO
a	OO
problem	OO
as	OO
well	.O
plants	OU
that	OO
are	OO
making	OO
more	OO
carbon	,O
those	OO
soils	OO
become	OO
enriched	OO
in	OO
carbon	.O
and	OU
carbon	OO
enriched	OO
soils	OO
actually	OO
hold	OO
nitrogen	OO
and	OO
they	OO
hold	OO
sulphur	OO
and	OO
they	OO
hold	OO
phosphate	OO
—	OO
all	OO
the	OO
minerals	OO
that	OO
are	OO
required	OO
for	OO
plants	OO
to	OO
grow	OO
and	OO
have	OO
a	OO
good	OO
yield	.O
and	OU
they	OO
also	OO
retain	OO
water	OO
in	OO
the	OO
soil	OO
as	OO
well	.O
so	OU
the	OO
suberin	OO
will	OO
break	OO
up	OO
into	OO
little	OO
particles	OO
and	OO
give	OO
the	OO
whole	OO
soil	OO
a	OO
new	OO
texture	.O
and	OU
as	OO
we've	OO
shown	OO
that	OO
we	OO
can	OO
get	OO
more	OO
carbon	OO
in	OO
that	OO
soil	,O
the	OO
soil	OO
will	OO
get	OO
darker	.O
and	OU
so	OO
we	OO
will	OO
be	OO
able	OO
to	OO
measure	OO
all	OO
that	,O
and	OO
hopefully	,O
this	OO
is	OO
going	OO
to	OO
help	OO
us	OO
solve	OO
the	OO
problem	.O
so	,U
ok	.U
so	OU
we	OO
have	OO
the	OO
challenges	OO
of	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
land	OO
that	OO
we	OO
need	OO
to	OO
use	,O
we	OO
have	OO
to	OO
get	OO
farmers	OO
to	OO
buy	OO
it	,O
and	OO
that's	OO
going	OO
to	OO
be	OO
the	OO
hard	OO
thing	OO
for	OO
us	,O
i	OU
think	,O
because	OO
we're	OO
not	OO
really	OO
salesmen	,O
we're	OO
people	OO
who	OO
like	OO
to	OO
google	OU
a	OO
person	OO
rather	OO
than	OO
meet	OO
them	,O
you	OO
know	OO
what	OO
i	OU
mean	?O
that's	OU
what	OO
scientists	OO
are	OO
mostly	OO
like	.O
but	OU
we	OO
know	OO
now	OO
that	,O
you	OO
know	,O
no	OO
one	OO
can	OO
really	OO
deny	OO
—	OO
the	OO
climate	OO
is	OO
changing	,O
everyone	OO
knows	OO
that	.O
and	OU
it's	OO
here	OO
and	OO
it's	OO
bad	OO
and	OO
it's	OO
serious	,O
and	OO
we	OO
need	OO
to	OO
do	OO
something	OO
about	OO
it	.O
but	OU
i	OU
feel	OO
pretty	OO
optimistic	OO
that	OO
we	OO
can	OO
do	OO
this	.O
so	OU
i'm	OU
here	OO
today	OO
as	OO
a	OO
character	OO
witness	OO
for	OO
plants	.O
and	OU
i	OU
want	OO
to	OO
tell	OO
you	OO
that	OO
plants	OO
are	OO
going	OO
to	OO
do	OO
it	OO
for	OO
us	,O
all	OO
we	OO
have	OO
to	OO
do	OO
is	OO
give	OO
them	OO
a	OO
little	OO
help	,O
and	OO
they	OO
will	OO
go	OO
and	OO
get	OO
a	OO
gold	OO
medal	OO
for	OO
humanity	.O
thank	OU
you	OO
very	OO
much	.O
thank	OU
you	.O
i	OU
finally	OO
got	OO
it	OO
out	.O
chris	OU
anderson:	OU
wow	.U
joanne	,U
you're	OO
so	OO
extraordinary	.O
just	OU
to	OO
be	OO
sure	OO
we	OO
heard	OO
this	OO
right:	OO
you	OO
believe	OO
that	OO
within	OO
the	OO
next	OO
10	OO
years	OO
you	OO
may	OO
be	OO
able	OO
to	OO
offer	OO
the	OO
world	OO
seed	OO
variants	OO
for	OO
the	OO
major	OO
crops	,O
like	OO
—	OO
what	?O
—	OO
wheat	,O
corn	,O
maybe	OO
rice	,O
that	OO
can	OO
offer	OO
farmers	OO
just	OO
as	OO
much	OO
yield	,O
sequester	OO
three	OO
times	,O
four	OO
times	,O
more	OO
carbon	OO
than	OO
they	OO
currently	OO
do	?O
even	OU
more	OO
than	OO
that	?O
joanne	OU
chory:	OU
we	OU
don't	OO
know	OO
that	OO
number	,O
really	.O
but	OU
they	OO
will	OO
do	OO
more	.O
ca:	OU
and	OU
at	OO
the	OO
same	OO
time	,O
make	OO
the	OO
soil	OO
that	OO
those	OO
farmers	OO
have	OO
more	OO
fertile	?O
jc:	OU
yes	,U
right	.O
ca:	OU
so	OU
that	OO
is	OO
astonishing	.O
and	OU
the	OO
genius	OO
of	OO
doing	OO
that	OO
and	OO
a	OO
solution	OO
that	OO
can	OO
scale	OO
where	OO
there's	OO
already	OO
scale	.O
jc:	OU
yes	,U
thank	OO
you	OO
for	OO
saying	OO
that	.O
ca:	OU
no	,U
no	,O
you	OO
said	OO
it	,O
you	OO
said	OO
it	.O
but	OU
it	OO
almost	OO
seems	OO
too	OO
good	OO
to	OO
be	OO
true	.O
your	OU
audacious	OU
project	OU
is	OO
that	OO
we	OO
scale	OO
up	OO
the	OO
research	OO
in	OO
your	OO
lab	OO
and	OO
pave	OO
the	OO
way	OO
to	OO

jc:	OU
that's	OU
right	,O
yes	,O

you	.O
ca:	OU
joanne	OU

you	OO
so	OO
much	.O

of	OO

what's	OO

is	OO
the	OO
experience	OO
of	OO
the	OO

we	OO
have	OO
to	OO
take	OO
responsibility	OO
for	OO
every	OO
minute	OO
that	OO
the	OO
audience	OO
spend	OO
with	OO
us	.O
we're	OU
a	OO
bit	OO

a	OO

for	OO
a	OO

passengers	.O
and	OU
in	OO
the	OO
case	OO
of	OO
the	OO
canadian	OU

the	OU

we	OO
translated	OO
this	OO

literally	OO
into	OO
an	OO

paper	OO
folding	OO

that	OO
took	OO
off	OO
over	OO
the	OO

of	OO
the	OO

rose	OO
out	OO
of	OO
the	OO

restored	OO
at	OO
the	OO

of	OO
the	OO

like	OO
any	OO
flight	,O
the	OO
most	OO
delicate	OO
part	OO
is	OO
the	OO
liftoff	,O
the	OO
beginning	,O
because	OO
when	OO
you	OO
design	OO
a	OO
pop	OO
concert	,O
the	OO
prime	OO
material	OO
that	OO
you're	OO
working	OO
with	OO
is	OO
something	OO
that	OO

take	OO

or	OO
crew	OO
to	OO
transport	OO
it	.O
it	OU
doesn't	OO
cost	OO
anything	,O
and	OO
yet	OO
it	OO
fills	OO
every	OO
atom	OO
of	OO
air	OO
in	OO
the	OO
arena	,O
before	OO
the	OO
show	OO
starts	.O
it's	OU
the	OO
audience's	OO
anticipation	.O
everyone	OU
brings	OO
with	OO
them	OO
the	OO
story	OO
of	OO
how	OO
they	OO
came	OO
to	OO

there	,O
the	OO
distances	OO
they	OO
traveled	,O
the	OO

they	OO
had	OO
to	OO

to	OO
pay	OO
for	OO
the	OO

sometimes	OU
they	OO
sleep	OO
overnight	OO
outside	OO
the	OO

and	OO
our	OO
first	OO
task	OO
is	OO
to	OO
deliver	OO
for	OO
an	OO
audience	OO
on	OO
their	OO
anticipation	,O
to	OO
deliver	OO
their	OO
first	OO
sight	OO
of	OO
the	OO

when	OU

work	OO
with	OO
men	,O
they're	OO
quite	OO
happy	OO
to	OO
have	OO
their	OO
music	OO
transformed	OO
into	OO
metaphor	OO
—	OO
spaceflights	,O
mountains	.O
but	OU
with	OO
women	,O
we	OO
work	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
with	OO
masks	OO
and	OO
with	OO
three	OO
dimensional	OO
portraiture	,O
because	OO
the	OO
fans	OO
of	OO
the	OO

crave	OO
her	OO

and	OU
when	OO
the	OO

adele's	OU
first	OO
live	OO
concert	OO
in	OO
five	OO
years	,O

around	OO

began	.O
adele:	OU
hello	.U

with	OU
u2	,U
we're	OO
navigating	OO
the	OO
audience	OO
over	OO
a	OO
terrain	OO
that	OO
spans	OO
three	OO
decades	OO
of	OO
politics	,O
poetry	OO
and	OO
music	.O
and	OU
over	OO
many	OO
months	,O
meeting	OO
with	OO
the	OO
band	OO
and	OO
their	OO
creative	OO
teams	,O
this	OO
is	OO
the	OO
sketch	OO
that	OO
kept	OO
recurring	,O
this	OO
line	,O
this	OO
street	,O
the	OO
street	OO
that	OO
connects	OO
the	OO
band's	OO
past	OO
with	OO
their	OO
present	,O
the	OO
tightrope	OO
that	OO
they	OO
walk	OO
as	OO
activists	OO
and	OO
artists	,O
a	OO
walk	OO
through	OO
cinema	OO
that	OO
allows	OO
the	OO
band	OO
to	OO
become	OO
protagonists	OO
in	OO
their	OO
own	OO
poetry	.O

that	OU

inside	OO

devlin:	OU
the	OU
end	OO
of	OO
the	OO
show	OO
is	OO
like	OO
the	OO
end	OO
of	OO
a	OO
flight	.O
it's	OU
an	OO
arrival	.O
it's	OU
a	OO
transfer	OO
from	OO
the	OO
stage	OO
out	OO
to	OO
the	OO
audience	.O
for	OU
the	OO
british	OU
band	OO
take	OU
that	,U
we	OO
ended	OO
the	OO
show	OO
by	OO
sending	OO
an	OO
80	OO
foot	OO
high	OO
mechanical	OO
human	OO
figure	OO
out	OO
to	OO
the	OO
center	OO
of	OO
the	OO
crowd	.O
like	OU
many	OO
translations	OO
from	OO
music	OO
to	OO
mechanics	,O
this	OO
one	OO
was	OO
initially	OO
deemed	OO
entirely	OO
technically	OO
impossible	.O
the	OU
first	OO
three	OO
engineers	OO
we	OO
took	OO
it	OO
to	OO
said	OO
no	,O
and	OO
eventually	,O
the	OO
way	OO
that	OO
it	OO
was	OO
achieved	OO
was	OO
by	OO
keeping	OO
the	OO
entire	OO
control	OO
system	OO
together	OO
while	OO
it	OO
toured	OO
around	OO
the	OO
country	,O
so	OO
we	OO
had	OO
to	OO
fold	OO
it	OO
up	OO
onto	OO
a	OO
flatbed	OO
truck	OO
so	OO
it	OO
could	OO
tour	OO
around	OO
without	OO
coming	OO
apart	.O
and	OU
of	OO
course	,O
what	OO
this	OO
meant	OO
was	OO
that	OO
the	OO
dimension	OO
of	OO
its	OO
head	OO
was	OO
entirely	OO
determined	OO
by	OO
the	OO
lowest	OO
motorway	OO
bridge	OO
that	OO
it	OO
had	OO
to	OO
travel	OO
under	OO
on	OO
its	OO
tour	.O
and	OU
i	OU
have	OO
to	OO
tell	OO
you	OO
that	OO
it	OO
turns	OO
out	OO
there	OO
is	OO
an	OO
unavoidable	OO
and	OO
annoyingly	OO
low	OO
bridge	OO
low	OO
bridge	OO
just	OO
outside	OO
hamburg	.U
another	OU
of	OO
the	OO
most	OO
technically	OO
complex	OO
pieces	OO
that	OO
we've	OO
worked	OO
on	OO
is	OO
the	OO
opera	OO
carmen	OU
at	OO
bregenz	OU
festival	OU
in	OO
austria	.U
we	OU
envisaged	OO
carmen's	OU
hands	OO
rising	OO
out	OO
of	OO
lake	OU
constance	,U
and	OO
throwing	OO
this	OO
deck	OO
of	OO
cards	OO
in	OO
the	OO
air	OO
and	OO
leaving	OO
them	OO
suspended	OO
between	OO
sky	OO
and	OO
sea	.O
but	OU
this	OO
transient	OO
gesture	,O
this	OO
flick	OO
of	OO
the	OO
wrists	OO
had	OO
to	OO
become	OO
a	OO
structure	OO
that	OO
would	OO
be	OO
strong	OO
enough	OO
to	OO
withstand	OO
two	OO
austrian	OU
winters	.O
so	OU
there's	OO
an	OO
awful	OO
lot	OO
that	OO
you	OO
don't	OO
see	OO
in	OO
this	OO
photograph	OO
that's	OO
working	OO
really	OO
hard	.O
it's	OU
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
ballast	OO
and	OO
structure	OO
and	OO
support	OO
around	OO
the	OO
back	,O
and	OO
i'm	OU
going	OO
to	OO
show	OO
you	OO
the	OO
photos	OO
that	OO
aren't	OO
on	OO
my	OO
website	.O
they're	OU
photos	OO
of	OO
the	OO
back	OO
of	OO
a	OO
set	,O
the	OO
part	OO
that's	OO
not	OO
designed	OO
for	OO
the	OO
audience	OO
to	OO
see	,O
however	OO
much	OO
work	OO
it's	OO
doing	.O
and	OU
you	OO
know	,O
this	OO
is	OO
actually	OO
the	OO
dilemma	OO
for	OO
an	OO
artist	OO
who	OO
is	OO
working	OO
as	OO
a	OO
stage	OO
designer	,O
because	OO
so	OO
much	OO
of	OO
what	OO
i	OU
make	OO
is	OO
fake	,O
it's	OO
an	OO
illusion	.O
and	OU
yet	OO
every	OO
artist	OO
works	OO
in	OO
pursuit	OO
of	OO
communicating	OO
something	OO
that's	OO
true	.O
but	OU
we	OO
are	OO
always	OO
asking	OO
ourselves:	OO
can	OU
we	OO
communicate	OO
truth	OO
using	OO
things	OO
that	OO
are	OO
false	?O
and	OU
now	OO
when	OO
i	OU
attend	OO
the	OO
shows	OO
that	OO
i've	OU
worked	OO
on	,O
i	OU
often	OO
find	OO
i'm	OU
the	OO
only	OO
one	OO
who	OO
is	OO
not	OO
looking	OO
at	OO
the	OO
stage	.O
i'm	OU
looking	OO
at	OO
something	OO
that	OO
i	OU
find	OO
equally	OO
fascinating	,O
and	OO
it's	OO
the	OO
audience	.O
i	OU
mean	,O
where	OO
else	OO
do	OO
you	OO
witness	OO
this:	OO
this	OO
many	OO
humans	,O
connected	,O
focused	,O
undistracted	OO
and	OO
unfragmented	?O
and	OU
lately	,O
i've	OU
begun	OO
to	OO
make	OO
work	OO
that	OO
originates	OO
here	,O
in	OO
the	OO
collective	OO
voice	OO
of	OO
the	OO
audience	.O
poem	OU
portraits	OU
is	OO
a	OO
collective	OO
poem	.O
it	OU
began	OO
at	OO
the	OO
serpentine	OU
gallery	OU
in	OO
london	,U
and	OO
everybody	OO
is	OO
invited	OO
to	OO
donate	OO
one	OO
word	OO
to	OO
a	OO
collective	OO
poem	.O
and	OU
instead	OO
of	OO
that	OO
large	OO
single	OO
led	OU
portrait	OO
that	OO
was	OO
broadcasting	OO
to	OO
the	OO
back	OO
of	OO
the	OO
stadium	,O
in	OO
this	OO
case	,O
every	OO
member	OO
of	OO
the	OO
audience	OO
gets	OO
to	OO
take	OO
their	OO
own	OO
portrait	OO
home	OO
with	OO
them	,O
and	OO
it's	OO
woven	OO
in	OO
with	OO
the	OO
words	OO
that	OO
they've	OO
contributed	OO
to	OO
the	OO
collective	OO
poem	.O
so	OU
they	OO
keep	OO
a	OO
fragment	OO
of	OO
an	OO
ever	OO
evolving	OO
collective	OO
work	.O
and	OU
next	OO
year	,O
the	OO

motorcycle	.O
right	?U
the	OU
biggest	OO
thing	OO
in	OO
his	OO
picture	.O
what	OU
can	OO
you	OO
tell	OO
about	OO
this	OO
girl	?O
she	OU
spends	OO
all	OO
her	OO
time	OO
on	OO
the	OO
beach	.O
there's	OU
a	OO
surfboard	.O
she	OU
lives	OO
by	OO
the	OO
sea	.O
what	OU
can	OO
you	OO
tell	OO
about	OO
this	OO
guy	?O
he's	OU
a	OO
chef	.O
look	OU
at	OO
all	OO
the	OO
ingredients	OO
he	OO
touched	OO
during	OO
the	OO
day	,O
while	OO
he	OO
was	OO
preparing	OO
the	OO
food	,O
and	OO
the	OO
computer	OO
is	OO
a	OO
tiny	OO
part	OO
of	OO
his	OO
life	,O
this	OO
sad	OO
thing	OO
in	OO
the	OO
corner	.O
so	OU
if	OO
we	OO
are	OO
using	OO
things	OO
all	OO
the	OO
time	,O
and	OO
this	OO
is	OO
a	OO
big	OO
part	OO
of	OO
our	OO
lives	,O
can	OO
things	OO
become	OO
the	OO
way	OO
for	OO
us	OO
to	OO
interact	OO
with	OO
our	OO
digital	OO
life	?O
can	OU
the	OO
world	OO
become	OO
your	OO
interface	?O
that	OU
was	OO
my	OO
idea	.O
i've	OU
been	OO
working	OO
for	OO
20	OO
years	OO
on	OO
it	.O
my	OU
idea	OO
is	OO
that	OO
in	OO
order	OO
to	OO
interact	OO
in	OO
digital	OO
life	,O
you	OO
don't	OO
need	OO
to	OO
have	OO
screens	OO
and	OO
keyboards	OO
and	OO
mouses	.O
you	OU
can	OO
interact	OO
with	OO
your	OO
digital	OO
life	OO
just	OO
by	OO
using	OO
the	OO
things	OO
you	OO
use	OO
every	OO
day	.O
and	OU
to	OO
realize	OO
this	OO
idea	,O
i	OU
need	OO
to	OO
solve	OO
three	OO
big	OO
challenges	.O
let	OU
me	OO
tell	OO
you	OO
about	OO
them	.O
the	OU
first	OO
one	,O
obviously:	OO
is	OU
it	OO
even	OO
possible	?O
how	OU
can	OO
you	OO
take	OO
an	OO
everyday	OO
thing	OO
you	OO
use	OO
every	OO
day	OO
and	OO
turn	OO
it	OO
into	OO
a	OO
computer	OO
interface	?O
now	OU
i	OU
was	OO
inspired	OO
by	OO
the	OO
book	OO
hackers	.U
i	OU
read	OO
it	OO
when	OO
i	OU
was	OO
a	OO
teenager	,O
and	OO
one	OO
of	OO
the	OO
essential	OO
ideas	OO
of	OO
this	OO
book	OO
is	OO
that	OO
you	OO
can	OO
change	OO
the	OO
purpose	OO
of	OO
things	OO
by	OO
inventing	OO
new	OO
technology	OO
and	OO
then	OO
hacking	OO
into	OO
things	OO
and	OO
changing	OO
them	.O
so	OU
i've	OU
been	OO
thinking	OO
what	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
technology	OO
i	OU
can	OO
invent	OO
so	OO
that	OO
i	OU
can	OO
hack	OO
into	OO
things	OO
you	OO
use	OO
every	OO
day	OO
and	OO
make	OO
them	OO
interactive	.O
so	OU
when	OO
i	OU
was	OO
working	OO
on	OO
this	OO
thing	,O
i	OU
invented	OO
this	OO
sensor	OO
which	OO
injects	OO
structured	OO
electric	OO
fields	OO
into	OO
objects	OO
and	OO
turns	OO
them	OO
into	OO
gesture	OO
interfaces	.O
so	OU
this	OO
doorknob	,O
unmodified	,O
can	OO
become	OO
a	OO
gesture	OO
sensor	.O
it	OU
can	OO
know	OO
how	OO
you're	OO
touching	OO
it	.O
it	OU
can	OO
feel	OO
how	OO
you're	OO
touching	OO
it	.O
it	OU
makes	OO
a	OO
circle	,O
or	OO
can	OO
i	OU
grasp	.O
and	OU
this	OO
doorknob	OO
isn't	OO
modified	.O
there's	OU
nothing	OO
special	OO
about	OO
doorknobs	.O
anything	OU
can	OO
become	OO
interactive	.O
what	OU
about	OO
plants	?O
so	OU
plants	OO
are	OO
interesting	,O
because	OO
with	OO
plants	,O
they	OO
can	OO
know	OO
where	OO
you're	OO
touching	.O
you	OU
can	OO
see	OO
the	OO
line	OO
moving	OO
up	OO
and	OO
down	OO
on	OO
the	OO
image	.O
and	OU
that	OO
can	OO
turn	OO
into	OO
a	OO
musical	OO
interface	.O
now	,U
we	OO
do	OO
have	OO
also	OO
practical	OO
applications:	OO
a	OO
calendar	OO
plant	OO
for	OO
those	OO
who	OO
are	OO
obsessed	OO
about	OO
practicality	.O
we	OU
can	OO
give	OO
things	OO
a	OO
personality	.O
so	OU
in	OO
this	OO
particular	OO
example	,O
the	OO
orchid	OO
can	OO
communicate	OO
to	OO
you	OO
through	OO
images	OO
and	OO
sounds	.O
it	OU
doesn't	OO
like	OO
to	OO
be	OO
touched	,O
so	OO
it's	OO
created	OO
these	OO
electric	OO
images	OO
that	OO
are	OO
hissing	OO
at	OO
you	.O
this	OU
plant	,O
for	OO
example	,O
is	OO
more	OO
robust	,O
it's	OO
a	OO
snake	OO
plant	,O
and	OO
it	OO
likes	OO
playing	OO
with	OO
you	.O
it	OU
engages	OO
you	.O
so	OU
every	OO
thing	OO
can	OO
be	OO
different	,O
and	OO
every	OO
thing	OO
can	OO
represent	OO
what	OO
it	OO
feels	.O
so	OU
everything	OO
can	OO
be	OO
hacked	,O
all	OO
the	OO
things	,O
including	OO
your	OO
body	.O
in	OU
this	OO
example	,O
we	OO
hacked	OO
your	OO
body	OO
so	OO
you	OO
can	OO
measure	OO
how	OO
you're	OO
folding	OO
your	OO
hands	OO
and	OO
then	OO
using	OO
your	OO
hand	OO
gestures	OO
to	OO
control	OO
something	OO
else	,O
so	OO
if	OO
you	OO
don't	OO
want	OO
to	OO
listen	OO
to	OO
some	OO
music	OO
thousands	OO
of	OO
times	,O
you	OO
simply	OO
can	OO
cover	OO
your	OO
ears	OO
to	OO
turn	OO
it	OO
off	.O
so	OU
everything	OO
can	OO
be	OO
hacked	,O
and	OO
research	OO
is	OO
important	,O
but	OO
the	OO
second	OO
challenge	OO
we	OO
have	OO
is	OO
how	OO
can	OO
we	OO
go	OO
from	OO
r	OU
and	OO
d	,U
and	OO
prototypes	,O
to	OO
real	OO
products	?O
how	OU
can	OO
we	OO
make	OO
real	OO
things	OO
that	OO
are	OO
also	OO
interfaces	?O
and	OU
you	OO
may	OO
ask	OO
yourself	,O
who	OO
would	OO
do	OO
this	?O
silicon	OU
valley	?U
is	OU
it	OO
through	OO
shenzhen	?U
now	OU
the	OO
challenge	OO
there	OO
is	OO
that	OO
the	OO
world	OO
of	OO
things	OO
is	OO
huge	.O
every	OU
year	,O
the	OO
apparel	OO
industry	OO
produces	OO
150	OO
billion	OO
garments	.O
in	OU
comparison	,O
the	OO
technology	OO
industry	OO
only	OO
makes	OO
1.4	OO
billion	OO
phones	.O
the	OU
world	OO
of	OO
things	OO
is	OO
much	OO
bigger	OO
than	OO
the	OO
world	OO
of	OO
technology	.O
the	OU
technology	OO
world	OO
cannot	OO
change	OO
the	OO
world	OO
of	OO
things	.O
instead	,U
we	OO
need	OO
to	OO
create	OO
technology	OO
which	OO
changes	OO
makers	OO
of	OO
things	,O
people	OO
who	OO
make	OO
your	OO
chairs	OO
and	OO
clothes	OO
and	OO
everything	OO
else	,O
into	OO
makers	OO
of	OO
smart	OO
things	,O
enable	OO
them	OO
to	OO
do	OO
that	.O
so	OU
to	OO
test	OO
this	OO
challenge	,O
we	OO
came	OO
up	OO
with	OO
a	OO
very	OO
simple	OO
idea	OO
and	OO
challenge:	OO
can	OU
a	OO
tailor	OO
make	OO
a	OO
wearable	?O
now	OU
we	OO
don't	OO
want	OO
to	OO
take	OO
a	OO
tailor	OO
and	OO
turn	OO
the	OO
tailor	OO
into	OO
an	OO
electrical	OO
engineer	.O
we	OU
still	OO
want	OO
to	OO
have	OO
some	OO
tailors	OO
around	.O
but	OU
what	OO
we	OO
would	OO
like	OO
to	OO
do	OO
is	OO
create	OO
technology	OO
which	OO
looks	,O
feels	OO
and	OO
behaves	OO
like	OO
a	OO
raw	OO
material	OO
used	OO
by	OO
the	OO
tailor	OO
to	OO
make	OO
their	OO
clothes	.O
for	OU
example	,O
a	OO
touch	OO
panel	OO
made	OO
for	OO
a	OO
tailor	OO
would	OO
look	OO
like	OO
this	,O
made	OO
out	OO
of	OO
textiles	,O
so	OO
you	OO
can	OO
cut	OO
it	OO
with	OO
scissors	OO
and	OO
sew	OO
it	OO
in	.O
at	OU
the	OO
same	OO
time	,O
it	OO
has	OO
to	OO
retain	OO
the	OO
performance	.O
the	OU
way	OO
to	OO
make	OO
this	OO
textile	OO
touch	OO
panel	OO
also	OO
requires	OO
a	OO
very	OO
different	OO
approach	OO
than	OO
for	OO
making	OO
consumer	OO
electronics	.O
in	OU
our	OO
case	,O
we	OO
have	OO
to	OO
go	OO
to	OO
the	OO
mountains	OO
of	OO
tokyo	OU
to	OO
a	OO
small	OO
factory	OO
which	OO
was	OO
making	OO
kimono	OO
garments	OO
for	OO
generations	.O
we	OU
worked	OO
with	OO
my	OO
collaborators	,O
who	OO
were	OO
not	OO
engineers	.O
it	OU
was	OO
an	OO
artisan	OO
who	OO
knows	OO
how	OO
to	OO
make	OO
things	OO
and	OO
an	OO
artist	OO
who	OO
knows	OO
how	OO
to	OO
make	OO
things	OO
beautiful	.O
working	OU
with	OO
them	,O
we	OO
created	OO
one	OO
of	OO
the	OO
best	OO
yarns	OO
in	OO
the	OO
world	,O
which	OO
consists	OO
of	OO
thin	OO
metallic	OO
alloys	OO
wrapped	OO
around	OO
with	OO
polyester	OO
fibers	OO
and	OO
cotton	OO
fibers	.O
these	OU
yarns	OO
were	OO
made	OO
in	OO
the	OO
same	OO
machines	OO
which	OO
were	OO
making	OO
yarns	OO
for	OO
kimonos	OO
for	OO
generations	.O
we	OU
then	OO
took	OO
these	OO
yarns	OO
and	OO
gave	OO
them	OO
to	OO
the	OO
factory	,O
which	OO
is	OO
making	OO
textiles	,O
and	OO
we	OO
wove	OO
our	OO
smart	OO
textile	OO
using	OO
regular	OO
machines	OO
in	OO
a	OO
variety	OO
of	OO
colors	OO
and	OO
materials	,O
and	OO
we	OO
gave	OO
those	OO
textiles	OO
to	OO
a	OO
tailor	OO
in	OO
savile	OU
row	OU
in	OO
london	.U
so	OU
tailors	OO
are	OO
traditionalists	,O
particularly	OO
in	OO
savile	OU
row	.U
they	OU
don't	OO
use	OO
computers	.O
they	OU
don't	OO
use	OO
machines	.O
they	OU
use	OO
hands	OO
and	OO
they	OO
cut	.O
they	OU
fit	OO
their	OO
products	OO
on	OO
the	OO
human	OO
body	,O
not	OO
on	OO
3	OO
d	OU
avatars	.O
technology	OU
is	OO
not	OO
a	OO
part	OO
of	OO
their	OO
vocabulary	,O
but	OO
they	OO
are	OO
modern	OO
people	.O
they	OU
know	OO
how	OO
to	OO
use	OO
technology	.O
so	OU
if	OO
technology	OO
can	OO
be	OO
formed	OO
and	OO
shaped	OO
like	OO
a	OO
button	,O
like	OO
a	OO
textile	,O
like	OO
something	OO
they	OO
can	OO
use	,O
they	OO
absolutely	OO
can	OO
make	OO
a	OO
wearable	,O
a	OO
garment	OO
which	OO
can	OO
place	OO
a	OO
phone	OO
call	.O
so	OU
now	OO
we've	OO
proven	OO
that	OO
you	OO
can	OO
actually	OO
make	OO
a	OO
wearable	,O
not	OO
by	OO
an	OO
electronic	OO
company	,O
but	OO
by	OO
a	OO
tailor	.O
we	OU
worked	OO
and	OO
collaborated	OO
with	OO
levi's	,U
our	OO
partners	OO
and	OO
our	OO
neighbors	,O
to	OO
make	OO
a	OO
real	OO
product	,O
and	OO
this	OO
product	OO
is	OO
this	OO
jacket	OO
i'm	OU
wearing	OO
right	OO
now	.O
you	OU
can	OO
buy	OO
it	.O
it's	OU
on	OO
sale	.O
it	OU
was	OO
made	OO
in	OO
the	OO
same	OO
factories	OO
which	OO
make	OO
all	OO
their	OO
products	,O
and	OO
you	OO
have	OO
noticed	OO
i've	OU
been	OO
controlling	OO
my	OO
presentation	OO
from	OO
the	OO
sleeve	OO
of	OO
the	OO
jacket	.O
i	OU
go	OO
like	OO
this	,O
it	OO
goes	OO
forward	.O
like	OU
this	,O
it	OO
goes	OO
backward	.O
and	OU
of	OO
course	,O
i	OU
can	OO
do	OO
more	OO
things	.O
it's	OU
not	OO
just	OO
to	OO
control	OO
a	OO
presentation	.O
i	OU
can	OO
now	OO
control	OO
my	OO
navigation	,O
control	OO
my	OO
music	,O
but	OO
most	OO
importantly	,O
it	OO
stays	OO
a	OO
jacket	,O
it	OO
stays	OO
a	OO
thing	,O
which	OO
makes	OO
me	OO
look	OO
great	.O
and	OU
that's	OO
the	OO
most	OO
important	OO
thing	.O
so	OU
ok	,U
we	OO
proved	OO
we	OO
can	OO
turn	OO
things	OO
into	OO
interfaces	.O
we	OU
proved	OO
that	OO
these	OO
things	OO
can	OO
be	OO
made	OO
by	OO
makers	OO
of	OO
things	OO
and	OO
not	OO
by	OO
technology	OO
companies	.O
i	OU
look	OO
awesome	.O
are	OU
we	OO
done	?O
not	OU
yet	.O
the	OU
third	OO
challenge:	OO
how	OU
can	OO
we	OO
scale	?O
how	OU
can	OO
we	OO
go	OO
from	OO
one	OO
product	OO
to	OO
many	OO
products	?O
and	OU
that's	OO
what	OO
we're	OO
working	OO
on	OO
right	OO
now	.O
let	OU
me	OO
tell	OO
you	OO
how	OO
we're	OO
going	OO
to	OO
do	OO
this	.O
first	OU
of	OO
all	,O
i	OU
want	OO
to	OO
make	OO
myself	OO
clear	OO
—	OO
i	OU
am	OO
not	OO
talking	OO
about	OO
the	OO
internet	OU
of	OO
things	.U
i'm	OU
not	OO
talking	OO
about	OO
creating	OO
another	OO
gadget	OO
you	OO
get	OO
bored	OO
with	OO
and	OO
throw	OO
in	OO
the	OO
back	OO
of	OO
your	OO
drawer	OO
and	OO
forget	OO
about	.O
i	OU
am	OO
talking	OO
about	OO
the	OO
foundational	,O
important	OO
principle	OO
which	OO
guides	OO
my	OO
work:	OO
technology	OU
has	OO
to	OO
make	OO
existing	OO
things	OO
better	.O
it	OU
makes	OO
them	OO
better	OO
by	OO
connecting	OO
them	OO
to	OO
your	OO
digital	OO
life	OO
and	OO
adds	OO
new	OO
usefulness	OO
and	OO
new	OO
functionality	OO
while	OO
remaining	OO
the	OO
same	OO
original	OO
purpose	,O
not	OO
changing	OO
it	.O
this	OU
jacket	OO
i	OU
am	OO
wearing	OO
can	OO
control	OO
my	OO
mobile	OO
phone	OO
and	OO
presentation	,O
but	OO
it	OO
still	OO
remains	OO
a	OO
jacket	.O
that	OU
means	OO
that	OO
once	OO
we	OO
start	OO
making	OO
all	OO
things	OO
interactive	OO
and	OO
connected	,O
every	OO
thing	OO
would	OO
have	OO
its	OO
own	OO
set	OO
of	OO
actuators	,O
displays	OO
and	OO
sensors	OO
specific	OO
for	OO
those	OO
things	.O
a	OU
pair	OO
of	OO
running	OO
shoes	OO
does	OO
not	OO
need	OO
to	OO
have	OO
a	OO
touch	OO
sensor	.O
why	OU
would	OO
it	OO
have	OO
one	?O
if	OU
you	OO
have	OO
a	OO
sensor	,O
it	OO
should	OO
measure	OO
your	OO
running	OO
performance	OO
or	OO
knee	OO
impact	,O
while	OO
remaining	OO
a	OO
great	OO
pair	OO
of	OO
shoes	.O
makers	OU
of	OO
things	OO
will	OO
have	OO
to	OO
start	OO
thinking	OO
what	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
digital	OO
functionality	OO
they	OO
have	OO
to	OO
offer	OO
to	OO
their	OO
consumers	.O
they	OU
will	OO
have	OO
to	OO
become	OO
service	OO
providers	,O
or	OO
they	OO
may	OO
become	OO
irrelevant	.O
we	OU
will	OO
have	OO
to	OO
provide	OO
and	OO
create	OO
a	OO
service	OO
ecosystem	OO
just	OO
like	OO
we've	OO
done	OO
for	OO
mobile	OO
phones	,O
where	OO
you	OO
have	OO
apps	OO
and	OO
services	OO
and	OO
everything	OO
else	,O
and	OO
sometimes	,O
you're	OO
still	OO
making	OO
a	OO
phone	OO
call	.O
now	OU
to	OO
make	OO
this	OO
ecosystem	OO
possible	,O
we	OO
have	OO
to	OO
avoid	OO
fragmentation	.O
we	OU
have	OO
to	OO
avoid	OO
different	OO
interfaces	OO
for	OO
different	OO
people	OO
for	OO
different	OO
things	.O
we	OU
have	OO
to	OO
create	OO
uniform	OO
user	OO
experience	OO
and	,O
for	OO
that	OO
reason	,O
we	OO
have	OO
to	OO
create	OO
a	OO
single	OO
computing	OO
platform	OO
which	OO
powers	OO
all	OO
those	OO
things	.O
what	OU
is	OO
the	OO
platform	OO
going	OO
to	OO
be	?O
and	OU
i	OU
think	OO
the	OO
answer	OO
is	OO
obvious:	OO
it's	OO
a	OO
cloud	,O
cloud	OO
computing	.O
now	OU
you	OO
cannot	OO
connect	OO
things	OO
directly	OO
to	OO
the	OO
cloud	,O
obviously	.O
so	OU
you	OO
have	OO
to	OO
develop	OO
a	OO
small	OO
device	OO
which	OO
can	OO
be	OO
plugged	OO
into	OO
all	OO
the	OO
things	OO
and	OO
make	OO
them	OO
connected	OO
to	OO
the	OO
cloud	OO
to	OO
unlock	OO
their	OO
potential	OO
and	OO
add	OO
new	OO
functionality	.O
so	OU
let	OO
me	OO
show	,O
for	OO
the	OO
first	OO
time	,O
the	OO
real	OO
device	OO
which	OO
we've	OO
built	.O
we	OU
are	OO
showing	OO
this	OO
for	OO
the	OO
first	OO
time	.O
that's	OU
what	OO
it	OO
looks	OO
like	,O
and	OO
it's	OO
a	OO
small	OO
device	OO
which	OO
will	OO
be	OO
connected	OO
to	OO
things	OO
we	OO
want	OO
to	OO
make	OO
smart	OO
and	OO
connected	OO
and	OO
interactive	.O
how	OU
is	OO
it	OO
going	OO
to	OO
work	?O
so	OU
on	OO
the	OO
back	,O
you	OO
have	OO
a	OO
few	OO
electrodes	.O
so	OU
when	OO
you	OO
plug	OO
them	OO
into	OO
different	OO
things	,O
like	OO
here	,O
the	OO
device	OO
will	OO
recognize	OO
where	OO
you're	OO
plugging	OO
them	OO
and	OO
then	OO
reconfigure	OO
itself	OO
to	OO
enable	OO
specific	OO
functionality	OO
for	OO
this	OO
particular	OO
thing	.O
we	OU
would	OO
like	OO
to	OO
give	OO
this	OO
device	OO
to	OO
makers	OO
of	OO
things	,O
the	OO
people	OO
who	OO
make	OO
your	OO
clothing	OO
and	OO
furniture	,O
so	OO
they	OO
can	OO
use	OO
it	OO
just	OO
like	OO
they	OO
use	OO
a	OO
button	OO
or	OO
a	OO
zipper	.O
and	OU
what	OO
they're	OO
going	OO
to	OO
make	OO
with	OO
them	OO
is	OO
up	OO
to	OO
them	.O
we	OU
don't	OO
want	OO
to	OO
dictate	OO
the	OO
use	OO
cases	.O
we	OU
would	OO
like	OO
to	OO
let	OO
people	OO
who	OO
make	OO
those	OO
things	OO
—	OO
artists	OO
and	OO
designers	,O
brands	OO
and	OO
craftsmen	OO
—	OO
to	OO
imagine	OO
and	OO
create	OO
this	OO
new	OO
world	OO
where	OO
things	OO
are	OO
connected	OO
and	OO
have	OO
all	OO
this	OO
new	,O
exciting	OO
digital	OO
functionality	.O
we	OU
don't	OO
need	OO
keyboards	OO
and	OO
screens	OO
and	OO
mouses	OO
to	OO
interact	OO
with	OO
your	OO
computer	.O
so	OU
i've	OU
been	OO
working	OO
on	OO
this	OO
idea	OO
for	OO
20	OO
years	,O
and	OO
now	OO
it's	OO
taking	OO
shape	,O
and	OO
as	OO
it's	OO
taking	OO
shape	,O
what	OO
we	OO
are	OO
realizing	OO
is	OO
that	OO
i	OU
always	OO
thought	OO
i	OU
was	OO
working	OO
on	OO
computer	OO
interfaces	,O
i	OU
always	OO
thought	OO
of	OO
myself	OO
as	OO
an	OO
interaction	OO
designer	,O
but	OO
i'm	OU
realizing	OO
that	OO
i'm	OU
not	OO
building	OO
interfaces	.O
what	OU
i	OU
realized	OO
is	OO
that	OO
me	OO
and	OO
my	OO
team	,O
we're	OO
building	OO
a	OO
new	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
computer	,O
an	OO

you	.O
i	OU

you	OO

from	OO
the	OO
52nd	OO
freest	OO
nation	OO
on	OO
earth	.O
as	OU
an	OO

it	OO
irritates	OO
me	OO
that	OO
my	OO
nation	OO
keeps	OO
sinking	OO
in	OO
the	OO

published	OO
by	OO

i'm	OU
the	OO

my	OU

in	OO
china	OU
during	OO

went	OO
to	OO

then	OO
came	OO
to	OO
the	OO

which	OO
means	OO
all	OO
my	OO

i've	OU
been	OO
acutely	OO
aware	OO
just	OO
how	OO
fragile	OO
an	OO
inheritance	OO
freedom	OO
truly	OO
is	.O
that's	OU
why	OO
i	OU
spend	OO
my	OO
time	OO
teaching	,O
preaching	OO
and	OO
practicing	OO
democracy	.O
i	OU
have	OO
no	OO
illusions	.O
all	OU
around	OO
the	OO
world	OO
now	,O
people	OO
are	OO
doubting	OO
whether	OO
democracy	OO
can	OO
deliver	.O
autocrats	OU
and	OO
demagogues	OO
seem	OO
emboldened	,O
even	OO
cocky	.O
the	OU
free	OO
world	OO
feels	OO
leaderless	.O
and	OU
yet	,O
i	OU
remain	OO
hopeful	.O
i	OU
don't	OO
mean	OO
optimistic	.O
optimism	OU
is	OO
for	OO

hope	OU
implies	OO
agency	.O
it	OU
says	OO
i	OU
have	OO
a	OO
hand	OO
in	OO
the	OO

democratic	OU
hope	OO
requires	OO
faith	OO
not	OO
in	OO
a	OO
strongman	OO
or	OO
a	OO
charismatic	OO
savior	OO
but	OO
in	OO
each	OO
other	,O
and	OO
it	OO
forces	OO
us	OO
to	OO
ask:	OO
how	OU
can	OO
we	OO
become	OO
worthy	OO
of	OO
such	OO
faith	?O
i	OU
believe	OO
we	OO
are	OO
at	OO
a	OO
moment	OO
of	OO
moral	OO
awakening	,O
the	OO
kind	OO
that	OO
comes	OO
when	OO
old	OO
certainties	OO
collapse	.O
at	OU
the	OO
heart	OO
of	OO
that	OO
awakening	OO
is	OO
what	OO
i	OU
call	OO
civic	OO
religion	.O
and	OU
today	,O
i	OU
want	OO
to	OO
talk	OO
about	OO
what	OO
civic	OO
religion	OO
is	,O
how	OO
we	OO
practice	OO
it	,O
and	OO
why	OO
it	OO
matters	OO
now	OO
more	OO
than	OO
ever	.O
let	OU
me	OO
start	OO
with	OO
the	OO
what	.O
i	OU
define	OO
civic	OO
religion	OO
as	OO
a	OO
system	OO
of	OO
shared	OO
beliefs	OO
and	OO
collective	OO
practices	OO
by	OO
which	OO
the	OO
members	OO
of	OO
a	OO
self	OO
governing	OO
community	OO
choose	OO
to	OO
live	OO
like	OO
citizens	.O
now	,U
when	OO
i	OU
say	OO
citizen	OO
here	,O
i'm	OU
not	OO
referring	OO
to	OO
papers	OO
or	OO
passports	.O
i'm	OU
talking	OO
about	OO
a	OO
deeper	,O
broader	,O
ethical	OO
conception	OO
of	OO
being	OO
a	OO
contributor	OO
to	OO
community	,O
a	OO
member	OO
of	OO
the	OO
body	.O
to	OU
speak	OO
of	OO
civic	OO
religion	OO
as	OO
religion	OO
is	OO
not	OO
poetic	OO
license	.O
that's	OU
because	OO
democracy	OO
is	OO
one	OO
of	OO
the	OO
most	OO
faith	OO
fueled	OO
human	OO
activities	OO
there	OO
is	.O
democracy	OU
works	OO
only	OO
when	OO
enough	OO
of	OO
us	OO
believe	OO
democracy	OO
works	.O
it	OU
is	OO
at	OO
once	OO
a	OO
gamble	OO
and	OO
a	OO
miracle	.O
its	OU
legitimacy	OO
comes	OO
not	OO
from	OO
the	OO
outer	OO
frame	OO
of	OO
constitutional	OO
rules	,O
but	OO
from	OO
the	OO
inner	OO
workings	OO
of	OO
civic	OO
spirit	.O
civic	OU
religion	,O
like	OO
any	OO
religion	,O
contains	OO
a	OO
sacred	OO
creed	,O
sacred	OO
deeds	OO
and	OO
sacred	OO
rituals	.O
my	OU

the	OO

i	OU

a	OO

that	OO
i'll	OU

you	OO
about	OO
in	OO
a	OO
moment	.O
wherever	OU

you're	OO

you	OO
can	OO

your	OO

set	OO
of	OO
creed	,O
deed	OO
and	OO
ritual	.O
the	OU
practice	OO
of	OO
civic	OO
religion	OO
is	OO
not	OO
about	OO
worship	OO
of	OO
the	OO
state	OO
or	OO
obedience	OO
to	OO
a	OO
ruling	OO
party	.O
it	OU
is	OO
about	OO
commitment	OO
to	OO
one	OO
another	OO
and	OO
our	OO
common	OO
ideals	.O
and	OU
the	OO
sacredness	OO
of	OO
civic	OO
religion	OO
is	OO
not	OO
about	OO
divinity	OO
or	OO
the	OO

it	OU
is	OO
about	OO
a	OO
group	OO
of	OO

our	OO

our	OO

perhaps	OU
now	OO
you're	OO

a	OO
little	OO
worried	OO
that	OO
i'm	OU
trying	OO
to	OO

you	OO
on	OO
a	OO
cult	.O
relax	,U
i'm	OU
not	.O
i	OU
don't	OO
need	OO
to	OO
sell	OO
you	.O
as	OU
a	OO
human	,O
you	OO
are	OO
always	OO
in	OO
the	OO
market	OO
for	OO
a	OO
cult	,O
for	OO
some	OO
variety	OO
of	OO

experience	.O
we	OU
are	OO

to	OO

that	OO

the	OU

we	OO

is	OO
whether	OO
to	OO

if	OU
you	OO

if	OO
you	OO
no	OO
longer	OO
go	OO
to	OO

then	OO
perhaps	OO
you'll	OO

that	OO

your	OO

or	OO
premier	OU

whether	OO
you	OO

in	OO
a	OO
god	OU
or	OO
in	OO
the	OO
absence	OO
of	OO

civic	OO
religion	OO

not	OO

it	OU

you	OO
only	OO
to	OO
show	OO
up	OO
as	OO
a	OO
citizen	.O
and	OU
that	OO
brings	OO
me	OO
to	OO
my	OO

topic:	OO
how	OO
we	OO
can	OO
practice	OO
civic	OO
religion	OO
productively	.O
let	OU
me	OO
tell	OO
you	OO
now	OO
about	OO
that	OO
new	OO
civic	OO
ritual	.O
it's	OU
called	OO
civic	OU
saturday	,U
and	OO
it	OO
follows	OO
the	OO
arc	OO
of	OO
a	OO
faith	OO
gathering	.O
we	OU
sing	OO
together	,O
we	OO
turn	OO
to	OO
the	OO
strangers	OO
next	OO
to	OO
us	OO
to	OO
discuss	OO
a	OO
common	OO
question	,O
we	OO
hear	OO
poetry	OO
and	OO
scripture	,O
there's	OO
a	OO
sermon	OO
that	OO
ties	OO
those	OO
texts	OO
to	OO
the	OO
ethical	OO
choices	OO
and	OO
controversies	OO
of	OO
our	OO
time	,O
but	OO
the	OO
song	OO
and	OO
scripture	OO
and	OO
the	OO
sermon	OO
are	OO
not	OO
from	OO
church	OO
or	OO
synagogue	OO
or	OO
mosque	.O
they	OU
are	OO
civic	,O
drawn	OO
from	OO
our	OO
shared	OO
civic	OO
ideals	OO
and	OO
a	OO
shared	OO
history	OO
of	OO
claiming	OO
and	OO
contesting	OO
those	OO
ideals	.O
afterwards	,U
we	OO
form	OO
up	OO
in	OO
circles	OO
to	OO
organize	OO
rallies	,O

voters	,O
join	OO
new	OO

my	OU

saturdays	OU
in	OO
seattle	OU
in	OO
2016	.O
since	OU
then	,O
they	OO
have	OO
spread	OO
across	OO
the	OO

sometimes	OU

they	OU
happen	OO
in	OO

there's	OU
nothing	OO

to	OO
a	OO
basic	OO
human	OO
yearning	OO

sexy	.U
it	OU
is	.O
sometimes	OU
i'm	OU
asked	,O
even	OO
by	OO
our	OO
seminarians:	OO
isn't	OU
it	OO
dangerous	OO
to	OO
use	OO
religious	OO
language	?O
won't	OU
that	OO
just	OO
make	OO
our	OO
politics	OO
even	OO
more	OO
dogmatic	OO
and	OO

righteous	?O
but	OU
this	OO
view	OO
assumes	OO
that	OO
all	OO
religion	OO
is	OO
fanatical	OO
fundamentalism	.O
it	OU
is	OO
not	.O
religion	OU
is	OO
also	OO
moral	OO
discernment	,O
an	OO
embrace	OO
of	OO
doubt	,O
a	OO
commitment	OO
to	OO
detach	OO
from	OO

others	,O
a	OO
challenge	OO
to	OO

the	OO

in	OU
this	OO
sense	,O
politics	OO
could	OO
stand	OO
to	OO
be	OO
a	OO
little	OO
more	OO
like	OO
religion	,O
not	OO
less	.O
thus	,U
my	OO
final	OO
topic	OO
today:	OO
why	OO
civic	OO
religion	OO
matters	OO
now	.O
i	OU
want	OO
to	OO
offer	OO
two	OO
reasons	.O
one	OU
is	OO
to	OO
counter	OO
the	OO
culture	OO
of	OO
hyperindividualism	.O
every	OU
message	OO
we	OO
get	OO
from	OO
every	OO
screen	OO
and	OO
surface	OO
of	OO
the	OO
modern	OO
marketplace	OO
is	OO
that	OO
each	OO
of	OO
us	OO
is	OO
on	OO
our	OO
own	,O
a	OO
free	OO
agent	,O
free	OO
to	OO
manage	OO
our	OO
own	OO
brands	,O
free	OO
to	OO
live	OO
under	OO
bridges	,O
free	OO
to	OO
have	OO
side	OO
hustles	,O
free	OO
to	OO
die	OO
alone	OO
without	OO
insurance	.O
market	OU
liberalism	OO
tells	OO
us	OO
we	OO
are	OO
masters	OO
beholden	OO
to	OO
none	,O
but	OO
then	OO
it	OO
enslaves	OO
us	OO
in	OO
the	OO
awful	OO
isolation	OO
of	OO
consumerism	OO
and	OO
status	OO
anxiety	.O
yeah	.U
millions	OU
of	OO
us	OO
are	OO
on	OO
to	OO
the	OO
con	OO
now	.O
we	OU
are	OO
realizing	OO
now	OO
that	OO
a	OO
free	OO
for	OO
all	OO
is	OO
not	OO
the	OO
same	OO
as	OO
freedom	OO
for	OO
all	.O
what	OU
truly	OO

the	OU

that	OO

we	OU

something	OO

it's	OO

all	OU

the	OO
moral	OO
compass	OO
is	OO
the	OO

what	,O
to	OO

has	OO
been	OO
missing	OO
from	OO

is	OO
a	OO
set	OO
of	OO

we	OU

just	OO

we	OO

to	OO
us	,O
that	OO

the	OO
climate	OO

the	OO
crisis	OO

you	OO

this	OO

they're	OO

what	OO
they	OO

they're	OO

the	OO

any	OO

the	OO

how	OO
they're	OO

now	.O
you	OU

you	OO

you	OU

it	OO
for	OO

you	OO
might	OO
do	OO
it	OO
for	OO

because	OO
this	OO

which	OO
is	OO
why	OO
many	OO

are	OO
doing	OO
the	OO

but	OU
at	OO
the	OO
end	OO
of	OO
the	OO

we	OO
need	OO
to	OO
ask	OO

who	OU
are	OO
we	OO
holding	OO
ourselves	OO
accountable	OO
for	?O
and	OU
if	OO
that	OO
isn't	OO
the	OO
next	OO
generation	,O
i	OU
don't	OO
know	OO
who	.O
so	OU
i	OU
want	OO
to	OO
just	OO
make	OO
very	OO
clear	,O
because	OO
we	OO
tend	OO
to	OO
think	OO
about	OO
leadership	OO
as	OO
only	OO
those	OO
who	OO
sit	OO
in	OO
positions	OO
of	OO
power	.O
to	OU
me	,O
leadership	OO
is	OO
not	OO
at	OO
all	OO
like	OO
that	.O
there's	OU
a	OO
leader	OO
inside	OO
every	OO
single	OO
one	OO
of	OO
us	,O
and	OO
our	OO
most	OO
important	OO
work	OO
in	OO
life	OO
is	OO
to	OO
release	OO
that	OO
leader	.O
and	OU
i	OU
think	OO
one	OO
of	OO
the	OO
greatest	OO
global	OO
examples	OO
we	OO
have	OO
of	OO
someone	OO
who	OO
didn't	OO
—	OO
no	OO
one	OO
gave	OO
her	OO
power	OO
—	OO
is	OO
the	OO
16	OO
year	OO
old	OO
girl	OO
called	OO
greta	OU
thunberg	.U
she's	OU
from	OO
sweden	,U
and	OO
a	OO
few	OO
years	OO
ago	,O
she	OO
really	OO
became	OO
—	OO
she	OO
has	OO
asperger's	,U
and	OO
she	OO
became	OO
passionate	OO
about	OO
our	OO
climate	OO
crisis	OO
—	OO
learned	OO
everything	OO
about	OO
it	.O
and	OU
faced	OO
with	OO
the	OO
evidence	,O
she	OO
just	OO
felt	OO
so	OO
disappointed	OO
in	OO
her	OO
leadership	OO
that	OO
she	OO
started	OO
striking	OO
in	OO
front	OO
of	OO
the	OO
swedish	OU
parliament	.O
and	OU
now	OO
she	OO
has	OO
started	OO
a	OO
global	OO
movement	,O
and	OO
hundreds	OO
and	OO
thousands	OO
of	OO
school	OO
kids	OO
are	OO
out	OO
in	OO
the	OO
streets	OO
asking	OO
us	OO
to	OO
hold	OO
ourselves	OO
accountable	OO
for	OO
their	OO
future	.O
no	OU
one	OO
gave	OO
her	OO
that	OO
authority	,O
and	OO
she	OO
now	OO
speaks	OO
to	OO
the	OO
leaders	OO
of	OO
the	OO
world	,O
heads	OO
of	OO
state	,O
and	OO
really	OO
is	OO
impacting	OO
the	OO
world	.O
so	OU
i	OU
really	OO
think	OO
that	OO
when	OO
we	OO
think	OO
about	OO
leadership	OO
today	,O
it	OO
can't	OO
be	OO
defined	OO
to	OO
those	OO
in	OO
positions	OO
of	OO
power	OO
though	OO
they	OO
have	OO
disproportionately	OO
greater	OO
responsibility	.O
but	OU
all	OO
of	OO
us	OO
need	OO
to	OO
think	OO
about	,O
what	OU
am	OO
i	OU
doing	?O
how	OU
am	OO
i	OU
contributing	?O
and	OU
we	OO
need	OO
to	OO
release	OO
that	OO
leader	OO
inside	OO
and	OO
actually	OO
start	OO
making	OO
the	OO
positive	OO
impact	OO
this	OO
world	OO
is	OO
calling	OO
for	OO
right	OO
now	.O
bf:	OU
but	OU
we	OO
have	OO
such	OO
hierarchical	OO
leadership	.O
i	OU
mean	,O
i	OU
understand	OO
what	OO
you're	OO
saying	OO
—	OO
it's	OO
nice	OO
to	OO
release	OO
the	OO
leader	OO
inside	OO
—	OO
but	OO
in	OO
these	OO
corporations	,O
the	OO
truth	OO
is	,O
it's	OO
extremely	OO
hierarchical	.O
what	OU
can	OO
companies	OO
do	OO
to	OO
create	OO
less	OO
vertical	OO
and	OO
more	OO
horizontal	OO
relationships	?O
ht:	OU
well	,U
i'm	OU
a	OO
big	OO
believer	OO
and	OO
i've	OU
long	OO
been	OO
passionate	OO
about	OO
closing	OO
the	OO
gender	OO
gap	,O
and	OO
i	OU
really	OO
believe	OO
gender	OO
balanced	OO
leadership	OO
is	OO
the	OO
way	OO
to	OO
go	OO
in	OO
order	OO
to	OO
embrace	OO
a	OO
leadership	OO
style	OO
that	OO
has	OO
been	OO
shown	OO
to	OO
be	OO
more	OO
powerful	,O
and	OO
that's	OO
when	OO
both	OO
men	OO
and	OO
women	OO
embrace	OO
both	OO
masculine	OO
and	OO
feminine	OO
values	.O
it	OU
actually	OO
is	OO
proven	OO
in	OO
research	OO
that	OO
that's	OO
the	OO
most	OO
effective	OO
leadership	OO
style	.O
but	OU
i'm	OU
increasingly	OO
now	OO
thinking	OO
about	OO
how	OO
we	OO
close	OO
the	OO
generational	OO
gap	,O
because	OO
look	OO
at	OO
these	OO
young	OO
children	OO
in	OO
the	OO
streets	OO
around	OO
the	OO
world	OO
—	OO
they're	OO
asking	OO
us	OO
to	OO
lead	.O
kofi	OU
annan	OU
used	OO
to	OO
say	,O
you're	OU
never	OO
too	OO
young	OO
to	OO
lead	.O
and	OU
then	OO
he	OO
would	OO
add	,O
or	OU
too	OO
old	OO
to	OO
learn	.O
and	OU
i	OU
think	OO
we	OO
have	OO
now	OO
entered	OO
this	OO
era	OO
where	OO
we	OO
need	OO
the	OO
wisdom	OO
of	OO
those	OO
with	OO
experience	,O
but	OO
we	OO
need	OO
the	OO
digital	OO
natives	OO
of	OO
the	OO
young	OO
generation	OO
to	OO
co	OO
mentor	OO
or	OO
to	OO
mentor	OO
us	OO
just	OO
as	OO
much	OO
as	OO
we	OO
can	OO
help	OO
with	OO
wisdom	OO
from	OO
the	OO
older	OO
people	.O
so	OU
it's	OO
a	OO
new	OO
reality	,O
and	OO
these	OO
old	,O
sort	OO
of	OO
hierarchical	OO
ways	OO
to	OO
think	OO
about	OO
things	,O
they're	OO
increasingly	OO
coming	OO
under	OO
pressure	OO
in	OO
this	OO
reality	.O
bf:	OU
and	OU
you've	OO
actually	OO
called	OO
that	OO
the	OO
hubris	OO

can	OU
you	OO
talk	OO
about	OO
that	?O
ht:	OU
well	,U
yes	,O
i	OU
think	OO
hubris	OO
is	OO
our	OO
cancer	OO
in	OO

that's	OU
when	OO

they	OO
know	OO
it	OO
all	,O
can	OO
do	OO
it	OO
all	,O
have	OO
all	OO
the	OO
answers	OO
and	OO
don't	OO
think	OO
they	OO
need	OO
to	OO
surround	OO
themselves	OO
with	OO
people	OO
who	OO
will	OO
make	OO
them	OO
better	,O
which	OO
to	OO
me	OO
would	,O
in	OO
some	OO
cases	,O
be	OO
more	OO
women	OO

younger	OO
people	OO
and	OO
people	OO
who	OO
are	OO
diverse	OO
and	OO
have	OO
different	OO
opinions	OO
in	OO
general	.O
hubris	OU
syndrome	OO
is	OO
so	OO
present	OO
in	OO

we	OO

many	OO
examples	OO

them	,O
i	OU
don't	OO

the	OO

over	OO

to	OO

do	OO

that	OO

we	OO
really	OO
do	OO

to	OO
transform	OO
that	,O

increasingly	,O
we	OO
will	OO
transform	OO
that	,O
because	OO
we	OO

these	OO

i	OU
feel	OO
will	OO
affect	OO
the	OO
whole	OO
company	,O
how	OO
do	OO
i	OU
go	OO
about	OO
changing	OO
their	OO
minds	OO
when	OO
they	OO
feel	OO
as	OO
if	OO
they've	OO
had	OO
relationships	OO
that	OO
are	OO
set	,O
that	OO
their	OO
way	OO
of	OO
business	OO
is	OO
set	?O
how	OU
do	OO
you	OO
change	OO
minds	OO
when	OO
you	OO
have	OO
no	OO
influence	?O
ht:	OU
well	,U
thank	OO
you	OO
very	OO
much	OO
for	OO
that	OO
fantastic	OO
question	.O
so	OU
sometimes	OO
people	OO
at	OO
the	OO
top	OO
won't	OO
listen	,O
but	OO
it's	OO
interesting	OO
that	OO
with	OO
the	OO
low	OO
trust	OO
we	OO
have	OO
in	OO
society	OO
right	OO
now	,O
the	OO
greatest	OO
trust	OO
we	OO
have	OO
is	OO
actually	OO
between	OO
the	OO
employee	OO
and	OO
the	OO
employer	,O
according	OO
to	OO
recent	OO
research	.O
so	OU
i	OU
think	OO
that	OO
relationship	OO
may	OO
be	OO
the	OO
most	OO
powerful	OO
way	OO
to	OO
actually	OO
transform	OO
the	OO
way	OO
we	OO
do	OO
things	.O
so	OU
i	OU
would	OO
start	OO
by	OO
trying	OO
to	OO
build	OO
a	OO
coalition	OO
for	OO
your	OO
good	OO
idea	.O
and	OU
i	OU
don't	OO
know	OO
a	OO
single	OO
leader	OO
today	OO
who	OO
will	OO
not	OO
listen	OO
to	OO
a	OO
concern	OO
that	OO
many	OO
of	OO
their	OO
employees	OO
hold	.O
i'll	OU
give	OO
you	OO
an	OO
example	OO
from	OO
another	OO
b	OU
team	OU
leader	,O
marc	OU
benioff	,U
the	OO
ceo	OU
of	OO
salesforce	.U
he's	OU
really	OO
been	OO
outspoken	OO
on	OO
homelessness	OO
in	OO
san	OU
francisco	,U
on	OO
lgbtqi	OU
rights	,O
and	OO
all	OO
of	OO
the	OO
things	OO
that	OO
he's	OO
been	OO
standing	OO
up	OO
for	,O
he	OO
does	OO
because	OO
his	OO
employees	OO
care	OO
about	OO
them	.O
so	OU
don't	OO
ever	OO
think	OO
you	OO
don't	OO
have	OO
power	OO
if	OO
you	OO
don't	OO
sit	OO
in	OO
a	OO
position	OO
of	OO
power	.O
find	OU
the	OO
way	OO
to	OO
go	OO
convince	OO
him	.O
or	OO
her	.O
and	OU
marc	,U
for	OO
example	,O
was	OO
convinced	OO
to	OO
close	OO
the	OO
gender	OO
pay	OO
gap	OO
by	OO
two	OO
women	OO
who	OO
worked	OO
inside	OO
of	OO
his	OO
organization	,O
who	OO
told	OO
him	,O
we	OU
have	OO
a	OO
gender	OO
pay	OO
gap	.O
he	OU
didn't	OO
believe	OO
it;	OO
he	OO
said	,O
bring	OU
me	OO
the	OO
data	.O
they	OU
did	,O
and	OO
he	OO
was	OO
smart	OO
enough	OO
to	OO
know	OO
he	OO
needed	OO
to	OO
do	OO
something	OO
about	OO
it	,O
and	OO
was	OO
one	OO
the	OO
first	OO
tech	OO
leaders	OO
to	OO
step	OO
up	OO
and	OO
do	OO
so	OO
voluntarily	.O
so	OU
don't	OO
ever	OO
think	OO
that	OO
you	OO
don't	OO
have	OO
power	,O
even	OO
if	OO
you	OO
don't	OO
sit	OO
in	OO
a	OO
position	OO
of	OO
power	,O
but	OO
find	OO
other	OO
people	OO
to	OO
support	OO
you	OO
and	OO
make	OO
the	OO
case	.O
bf:	OU
thank	OU
you	.O
anybody	OU
else	?O
any	OU
other	OO
questions	?O
audience:	OU
hi	,U
i'm	OU
overwhelmed	OO
by	OO
fascination	OO
with	OO
everything	OO
you're	OO
saying	,O
so	OO
thank	OO
you	.O
i	OU
just	OO
wanted	OO
to	OO
ask	OO
how	,O
like	,O
diversity	OO
in	OO
opinion	OO
and	OO
thought	OO
and	OO
also	OO
background	OO
has	OO
impacted	OO
your	OO
leadership	OO
ability	.O
and	OU
what	OO
do	OO
you	OO
think	OO
is	OO
the	OO
barricade	OO
that	OO
is	OO
limiting	OO
the	OO
overflow	OO
of	OO
diversity	OO
in	OO
all	OO
business	OO
settings	,O
and	OO
what	OO
do	OO
you	OO
think	OO
can	OO
impact	OO
the	OO
change	OO
in	OO
that	OO
setting	OO
but	OO
also	OO
to	OO
disrupt	OO
the	OO
overflow	OO
of	OO
generations	OO
of	OO
people	OO
staying	OO
in	OO
place	?O
and	OU
what	OO
do	OO
you	OO
think	OO
is	OO
the	OO
next	OO
step	OO
to	OO
breaking	OO
several	OO
glass	OO
ceilings	?O
bf:	OU
we're	OU
going	OO
to	OO
do	OO
an	OO
entire	OO
salon	OU
just	OO
on	OO
that	OO
question	.O
ht:	OU
i	OU
think	OO
bryn	OU
said	OO
it	OO
well	,O
but	OO
let	OO
me	OO
try	OO
and	OO
touch	OO
on	OO
it	.O
so	OU
the	OO
way	OO
i	OU
see	OO
gender	,O
it	OO
is	OO
a	OO
spectrum	OO
—	OO
you	OO
know	,O
men	OO
also	OO
have	OO
gender	.O
we	OU
sometimes	OO
forget	OO
about	OO
that	.O
we	OU
sometimes	OO
forget	OO
about	OO
that	.O
and	OU
i	OU
actually	OO
played	OO
a	OO
very	OO
masculine	OO
woman	OO
early	OO
in	OO
my	OO
career	,O
because	OO
those	OO
were	OO
the	OO
rules	OO
of	OO
the	OO
game	.O
and	OU
i	OU
achieved	OO
some	OO
success	OO
with	OO
it	,O
but	OO
fortunately	,O
i	OU
got	OO
to	OO
a	OO
place	OO
where	OO
i	OU
started	OO
embracing	OO
my	OO
feminine	OO
side	OO
as	OO
well	.O
but	OU
i	OU
would	OO
still	OO
say	OO
that	OO
the	OO
best	OO
leaders	OO
embrace	OO
both	,O
both	OO
women	OO
and	OO
men	.O
but	OU
i	OU
see	OO
gender	,O
also	,O
as	OO
one	OO
of	OO
the	OO
most	OO
powerful	OO
levers	OO
to	OO
shift	OO
values	OO
in	OO
culture	.O
so	OU
the	OO
reason	OO
i'm	OU
so	OO
passionate	OO
about	OO
women	OO
in	OO
leadership	OO
and	OO
believe	OO
that	OO
balance	OO
is	OO
needed	OO
is	OO
because	OO
right	OO
now	,O
our	OO
definition	OO
of	OO
success	OO
is	OO
incredibly	OO
masculine	.O
it's	OU
about	OO
financial	OO
profit	OO
alone	OO
or	OO
economic	OO
growth	OO
alone	,O
and	OO
we	OO
all	OO
know	OO
that	OO
we	OO
need	OO
more	OO
than	OO
money	.O
i	OU
mean	,O
we	OO
need	OO
wellness:	OO
well	OO
being	OO
of	OO
people	,O
and	OO
there	OO
is	OO
no	OO
future	OO
beyond	OO
the	OO
well	OO
being	OO
of	OO
our	OO
planet	.O
so	OU
i	OU
think	OO
gender	OO
may	OO
very	OO
well	OO
be	OO
one	OO
of	OO
the	OO
most	OO
powerful	OO
levers	OO
to	OO
help	OO
all	OO
of	OO
us	OO
shift	OO
our	OO
economic	OO
and	OO
social	OO
systems	OO
to	OO
be	OO
more	OO
welcoming	.O
and	OU
the	OO
answer	OO
to	OO
your	OO
last	OO
part	OO
—	OO
it's	OO
so	OO
complicated	,O
but	OO
let	OO
me	OO
try	OO
to	OO
give	OO
you	OO
a	OO
short	OO
one	.O
i	OU
believe	OO
that	OO
the	OO
way	OO
talent	OO
and	OO
consumption	OO
is	OO
shifting	OO
is	OO
going	OO
to	OO
increasingly	OO
get	OO
companies	OO
to	OO
look	OO
at	OO
adding	OO
difference	OO
into	OO
their	OO
leadership	,O

i	OU

why	OO
some	OO

you	OO

about	OO

here's	OU

here's	OU
the	OO

here's	OU

i	OU
actually	OO

a	OU

the	OO

good	OO

now	,U
i	OU
just	OO
want	OO
to	OO
stress	OO
that	OO
i'm	OU
completely	OO
aware	OO
of	OO
the	OO
very	OO
dire	OO
threats	OO
of	OO

and	OO

i	OU
just	OO
want	OO
to	OO
acknowledge	OO
that	OO
choosing	OO
to	OO
have	OO
babies	OO
is	OO
a	OO
deeply	,O
profoundly	OO
personal	OO
choice	.O
and	OU
that	OO
many	OO
who	OO
want	OO
to	OO
are	OO
unable	.O
but	OU
just	OO
for	OO
today	,O
let's	OO
examine	OO
the	OO
flip	OO
side	OO
of	OO
the	OO
coin	.O
at	OU
how	OO
not	OO
having	OO
enough	OO
new	OO
people	OO
is	OO
going	OO
to	OO
be	OO
a	OO
major	OO
problem	OO
moving	OO
forward	.O
according	OU
to	OO
the	OO
world	OU
health	OU
organization	,U
we	OO
need	OO
to	OO
average	OO
about	OO
2.1	OO
children	OO
per	OO
woman	OO
today	OO
just	OO
so	OO
we	OO
have	OO
enough	OO
people	OO
to	OO
replace	OO
the	OO
previous	OO
generation	.O
a	OU
lot	OO
of	OO
you	OO
thought	OO
overpopulation	OO
was	OO
going	OO
to	OO
be	OO
a	OO
problem	OO
in	OO
100	OO
years	OO
—	OO
yeah	,O
it	OO
might	OO
be	OO
underpopulation	.O
so	OU
a	OO
question:	OO
what	OO
happens	OO
if	OO
that	OO
number	OO
dips	OO
below	OO
2.1	?O
there's	OU
going	OO
to	OO
be	OO
a	OO
domino	OO
effect	.O
as	OU
all	OO
of	OO
us	OO
get	OO
older	,O
and	OO
live	OO
longer	,O
there's	OO
going	OO
to	OO
be	OO
a	OO
shrinking	OO
younger	OO
population	,O
which	OO
is	OO
going	OO
to	OO

now	,U
hungary's	OU
prime	OO
minister	OO

has	OO
proposed	OO
a	OO

solution	OO
to	OO
try	OO
to	OO
incentivize	OO
people	OO
to	OO
have	OO

he	OU

four	OO

no	OO

pay	OO

pretty	OU
good	,O
right	,O
pretty	OO
good	.O
at	OU
least	OO
it's	OO
better	OO
than	OO
russia's	OU
2007	OO
proposal	,O
which	OO
once	OO
offered	OO
women	OO
in	OO
a	OO
particular	OO
region	OO
the	OO
opportunity	OO
of	OO
winning	OO
a	OO
fridge	OO
if	OO
they	OO
had	OO
more	OO
kids	.O
yeah	,U
it	OO
didn't	OO
work	,O
it	OO
didn't	OO
work	.O
but	OU
hold	OO
on	,O
pump	OO
the	OO
brakes	.O
orbán	OU
is	OO
primarily	OO
proposing	OO
this	OO
because	OO
he	OO
wants	OO
to	OO
limit	OO
the	OO
population	OO
of	OO
muslims	OU
and	OO
people	OO
of	OO
color	.O
he	OU
says	OO
he	OO
doesn't	OO
think	OO
hungary's	OU
traditions	OO
and	OO
culture	OO
and	OO
color	OO
has	OO
to	OO
be	OO
mixed	OO
with	OO
those	OO
of	OO
others	.O
subtle	.U
unfortunately	OU
for	OO
orbán	,U
and	OO
much	OO
of	OO
the	OO
eu	,U
the	OO
birth	OO
rates	OO
are	OO
not	OO
high	OO
enough	OO
right	OO
now	OO
to	OO
be	OO
replenished	OO
without	OO
immigration	.O
among	OU
eu	OU
countries	,O
there	OO
is	OO
a	OO
demographic	OO
decline	.O
so	OU
it	OO
seems	,O
in	OO
europe	,U
karma	OO
is	OO
going	OO
to	OO
be	OO
brown	OO
and	OO
muslim	.U
just	OU
saying	.O
the	OU
question	OO
remains:	OO
why	OU
aren't	OO
people	OO
having	OO
enough	OO
kids	?O
why	OU
is	OO
the	OO
birth	OO
rate	OO
declining	OO
in	OO
these	OO
countries	?O
in	OU
some	OO
cases	,O
it's	OO
because	OO
women	OO
are	OO
more	OO
literate	,O
more	OO
educated	.O
they	OU
have	OO
more	OO
economic	OO
opportunities	OO
—	OO
applaud	.O
all	OU
good	OO
things	,O
all	OO
good	OO
things	,O
yes	.O
in	OU
india	,U
this	OO
has	OO
been	OO
fantastic	,O
it	OO
has	OO
actually	OO
reduced	OO
the	OO
birth	OO
rate	OO
but	OO
kept	OO
it	OO
above	OO
that	OO
magic	OO
2.1	OO
number	.O
women	OU
also	OO
have	OO
more	OO
access	OO
to	OO
birth	OO
control	,O
more	OO
control	OO
over	OO
their	OO
reproductive	OO
lives	,O
all	OO
good	OO
things	.O
but	OU
in	OO
the	OO
united	OU
states	,U
in	OO
particular	,O
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
young	OO
people	OO
are	OO
opting	OO
out	OO
of	OO
having	OO
kids	,O
largely	OO
cite	OO
the	OO
same	OO
reason:	OO
financial	OO
concerns	.O
let's	OU
take	OO
the	OO
delorean	OU
to	OO
my	OO
motherland	,O
the	OO
united	OU
states	OU
of	OO
america	,U
where	OO
the	OO
birth	OO
rate	OO
hit	OO
its	OO
historic	OO
low	OO
in	OO
2017	.O
the	OU
united	OU
states	OU
is	OO
the	OO
most	OO
expensive	OO
country	OO
in	OO
the	OO
world	OO
to	OO
give	OO
birth	.O
if	OU
you	OO
do	OO
not	OO
have	OO
insurance	,O
it	OO
will	OO
cost	OO
you	OO
32,000	OO
dollars	OO
to	OO
have	OO
a	OO
baby	,O
if	OO
everything	OO
goes	OO
perfectly	.O
that's	OU
like	OO
buying	OO
a	OO
brand	OO
new	OO
honda	OU
odyssey	OU
minivan	,O
ok	?U
so	,U
congratulations	,O
you	OO
just	OO
had	OO
a	OO
baby	,O
but	OO
the	OO
baby's	OO
economic	OO
productivity	OO
is	OO
zero	,O
and	OO
guess	OO
what	?O
the	OU
united	OU
states	OU
is	OO
the	OO
only	OO
industrialized	OO
country	OO
in	OO
the	OO
world	OO
that	OO
does	OO
not	OO
require	OO
employers	OO
to	OO
offer	OO

mom	,U
you	OO
just	OO
had	OO
a	OO
baby	,O
congratulations	,O
that's	OO
lovely	.O
get	OU
back	OO
to	OO
work	OO
or	OO
you're	OO
fired	,O
young	OO
mom	.O
my	OU
wife	OO
and	OO
i	,U
both	OO
working	OO
parents	,O
pay	OO
about	OO
3,500	OO
dollars	OO
a	OO
month	OO
—	OO
a	OO
month	OO
—	OO
in	OO
virginia	OU
for	OO
childcare	.O
if	OU
you	OO
do	OO
the	OO
math	,O
that's	OO
40,000	OO
dollars	OO
a	OO

that's	OU
like	OO
buying	OO
a	OO

new	,O
souped	OO
up	,O

ok	.U
i	OU
have	OO
one	,O
i	OU
do	OO
not	OO

10	.O
so	OU
here's	OO
my	OO
bold	OO
suggestion	.O
let's	OU
make	OO
it	OO
easier	OO
for	OO
people	OO
to	OO
have	OO
babies	.O
it	OU
seems	OO
in	OO
order	OO
to	OO
invest	OO
in	OO
our	OO
future	,O
we	OO
actually	OO
have	OO
to	OO
invest	OO
in	OO
the	OO
present	OO
and	OO
help	OO
those	OO
people	OO
who	OO
want	OO
to	OO
become	OO
parents	.O
give	OU
them	OO
affordable	OO
health	OO
care	,O
give	OO
them	OO
affordable	OO
childcare	,O
give	OO
them	OO
paid	OO
parental	OO
leave	.O
among	OU
the	OO
eu	OU
states	OO
in	OO
2017	,O
france	OU
reported	OO
the	OO
highest	OO
birth	OO
rates	.O
why	?U
largely	OU
due	OO
to	OO
its	OO
pronatal	OO
policies	OO
that	OO
actually	OO
kept	OO
women	OO
in	OO
the	OO
workforce	.O
i'm	OU
talking	OO
about	OO
subsidized	OO
daycare	OO
and	OO
paid	OO
maternal	OO
leave	.O
china	OU
and	OO
japan	,U
thank	OO
god	,U
are	OO
finally	OO
wisening	OO
up	OO
and	OO
proposing	OO
such	OO
policies	.O
this	OU
is	OO
great	.O
that	OU

i	OU
know	OO
some	OO
of	OO
you	OO
have	OO
listened	OO
to	OO
me	OO

you	OO
still	OO
think	OO
the	OO
best	OO
investment	OO
we	OO
can	OO
make	OO
in	OO
the	OO
future	OO
is	OO
not	OO

i	OU

i	OU

where	OO
you're	OO

i	OU

many	OO
of	OO
you	OO
in	OO
this	OO

want	OO
to	OO

but	OO
you	OO
are	OO
terrified	OO
about	OO
the	OO

as	OO
a	OO

i	OU
feel	OO
you	.O
i'm	OU

about	OO

i	OU

a	OO

it	OO

for	OO

while	OO

at	OO

my	OO

my	OO
ibrahim	OU

my	OO

i	OU

to	OO
my	OO

and	OO
despite	OO
the	OO
terrible	OO
news	OO
and	OO
the	OO
fight	OO
ahead	,O
we	OO
both	OO
concluded	OO
that	OO
we	OO
regret	OO
nothing	.O
deciding	OU
to	OO
have	OO
babies	OO
was	OO
the	OO
best	OO
decision	OO
we	OO
ever	OO
made	.O
our	OU
babies	OO
have	OO
brought	OO
us	OO
so	OO
much	OO
joy	OO
and	OO
they've	OO
brought	OO
the	OO
world	OO
so	OO
much	OO
joy	,O
and	OO
having	OO
kids	OO
is	OO
a	OO
risk	,O
but	OO
life	OO
is	OO
a	OO
risk	.O
and	OU
yes	,O
i	OU
hope	OO
you've	OO
been	OO
paying	OO
attention	,O
we	OO
need	OO
to	OO
invest	OO
in	OO
babies	OO
in	OO
developed	OO
countries	OO
if	OO
we	OO
want	OO
to	OO
help	OO
save	OO
our	OO
economy	OO
and	OO
pensions	.O
but	OU
that's	OO
not	OO
the	OO
reason	OO
you	OO
have	OO
babies	.O
that's	OU
not	OO
the	OO
main	OO
reason	.O
babies	OU
have	OO
always	OO
represented	OO
humanity's	OO
best	,O
boldest	,O
most	OO
beautiful	OO
infinite	OO
possibilities	.O
and	OU
if	OO
we	OO
in	OO
developed	OO
countries	,O
as	OO
a	OO
whole	,O
opt	OO
out	,O
and	OO
don't	OO
invest	OO
in	OO
present	OO
and	OO
future	OO
generations	,O
then	OO
what	OO
the	OO
hell's	OO
the	OO
point	?O
what's	OU
the	OO
point	OO
of	OO
being	OO
on	OO
this	OO
absurd	OO
journey	OO
together	?O
and	OU
so	,O
for	OO
those	OO
who	OO
can	OO
and	OO
who	OO
choose	OO
to	,O
for	OO
those	OO
who	OO
can	OO
and	OO
who	OO
choose	OO
to	OO
have	OO

may	OO
you	OO
pass	OO
on	OO
this	OO
beautiful	OO
thing	OO
called	OO
life	,O
with	OO
kindness	,O
generosity	,O
decency	OO
and	OO
love	.O
thank	OU
you	.O
so	OU
i	OU
have	OO
a	OO
confession	OO
to	OO
make	.O
i	OU
only	OO
recently	OO
learned	OO
how	OO
to	OO
drive	.O
and	OU
it	OO
was	OO
really	OO
hard	.O
now	,U
this	OO
wasn't	OO
an	OO
older	OO
brain	OO
thing	.O
do	OU
you	OO
remember	OO
what	OO
it	OO
was	OO
like	OO
when	OO
you	OO
first	OO
learned	OO
how	OO
to	OO
drive	?O
when	OU
every	OO
decision	OO
you	OO
made	OO
was	OO
so	OO
conscious	OO
and	OO
deliberate	?O
i'd	OU
come	OO
home	OO
from	OO
my	OO
lessons	OO
completely	OO
wiped	OO
out	OO
mentally	.O
now	,U
as	OO
a	OO
cognitive	OO
scientist	OO
i	OU
know	OO
that	OO
this	OO
is	OO
because	OO
i	OU
was	OO
using	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
something	OO
called	OO
executive	OO
function	.O
executive	OU
function	OO
is	OO
our	OO
amazing	OO
ability	OO
to	OO
consciously	OO
control	OO
our	OO
thoughts	,O
emotions	OO
and	OO
actions	OO
in	OO
order	OO
to	OO
achieve	OO
goals	.O
like	OO
learning	OO
how	OO
to	OO
drive	.O
it's	OU
what	OO
we	OO
use	OO
when	OO
we	OO
need	OO
to	OO
break	OO
away	OO
from	OO
habit	,O
inhibit	OO
our	OO
impulses	OO
and	OO
plan	OO
ahead	.O
but	OU
we	OO
can	OO
see	OO
it	OO
most	OO
clearly	OO
when	OO
things	OO
go	OO
wrong	.O
like	,U
have	OO
you	OO
ever	OO
accidentally	OO
poured	OO
orange	OO
juice	OO
on	OO
your	OO
cereal	?O
or	,U
ever	OO
start	OO
scrolling	OO
on	OO
facebook	OU
and	OO
suddenly	OO
realize	OO
you've	OO
missed	OO
a	OO
meeting	?O
or	OU
maybe	OO
this	OO
one's	OO
more	OO
familiar:	OO
ever	OU
plan	OO
to	OO
stop	OO
at	OO
the	OO
store	OO
on	OO
the	OO
way	OO
home	OO
from	OO
work	OO
and	OO
then	OO
drive	OO
all	OO
the	OO
way	OO
home	OO
instead	OO
on	OO
autopilot	?O
these	OU
things	OO
happen	OO
to	OO
everyone	.O
and	OU
we	OO
usually	OO
call	OO
it	OO
absentmindedness	,O
but	OO
what's	OO
really	OO
happening	OO
is	OO
we're	OO
experiencing	OO
a	OO
lapse	OO
in	OO
executive	OO
function	.O
so	OU
we	OO
use	OO
executive	OO
function	OO
every	OO
day	OO
in	OO
all	OO
aspects	OO
of	OO
our	OO
lives	.O
and	OU
over	OO
the	OO
past	OO
30	OO
years	,O
researchers	OO
have	OO
found	OO
that	OO
it	OO
predicts	OO
all	OO
kinds	OO
of	OO
good	OO
things	OO
in	OO
childhood	OO
and	OO
beyond	,O
like	OO
social	OO
skills	,O
academic	OO
achievement	,O
mental	OO
and	OO
physical	OO
health	,O
making	OO
money	,O
saving	OO
money	OO
and	OO
even	OO
staying	OO
out	OO
of	OO
jail	.O
sounds	OU
great	,O
doesn't	OO
it	?O
so	OU
it's	OO
no	OO
surprise	OO
that	OO
researchers	OO
like	OO
me	OO
are	OO
so	OO
interested	OO
in	OO
understanding	OO
it	OO
and	OO
figuring	OO
out	OO
ways	OO
to	OO
improve	OO
it	.O
but	OU
lately	,O
executive	OO
function	OO
has	OO
become	OO
a	OO
huge	OO
self	OO
improvement	OO
buzzword	.O
people	OU
think	OO
you	OO
can	OO
improve	OO
it	OO
through	OO
brain	OO
training	OO
iphone	OO
apps	OO
and	OO
computer	OO
games	,O
or	OO
by	OO
practicing	OO
it	OO
in	OO
a	OO
specific	OO
way	,O
like	OO
playing	OO
chess	.O
and	OU
researchers	OO
are	OO
trying	OO
to	OO
train	OO
it	OO
in	OO
the	OO
lab	OO
in	OO
the	OO
hopes	OO
of	OO
improving	OO
it	OO
and	OO
other	OO
things	OO
related	OO
to	OO
it	,O
like	OO
intelligence	.O
well	,U
i'm	OU
here	OO
to	OO
tell	OO
you	OO
that	OO
this	OO
way	OO
of	OO
thinking	OO
about	OO
executive	OO
function	OO
is	OO
all	OO
wrong	.O
brain	OU
training	OO
won't	OO
improve	OO
executive	OO
function	OO
in	OO
a	OO
broad	OO
sense	OO
because	OO
it	OO
involves	OO
exercising	OO
it	OO
in	OO
a	OO
narrow	OO
way	,O
outside	OO
of	OO
the	OO
real	OO
world	OO
contexts	OO
in	OO
which	OO
we	OO
actually	OO
use	OO
it	.O
so	OU
you	OO
can	OO
master	OO
that	OO
executive	OO
function	OO
app	OO
on	OO
your	OO
phone	,O
but	OO
that's	OO
not	OO
going	OO
to	OO

you	OO
stop	OO

oj	OU
on	OO
your	OO
cheeerios	OU
twice	OO
a	OO

if	OU
you	OO
really	OO
want	OO
to	OO

your	OO
executive	OO
function	OO
in	OO
a	OO
way	OO
that	OO
matters	OO
for	OO

you	OO

to	OO

how	OO

let	OU
me	OO
show	OO
you	OO
what	OO

there's	OU
a	OO
great	OO

shape	OO
—	OO
over	OO
and	OO
over	OO
until	OO
they	OO
build	OO
up	OO
a	OO
habit	.O
and	OU
then	OO
they're	OO
asked	OO
to	OO
switch	OO
and	OO
sort	OO
the	OO
same	OO
cards	OO
in	OO
another	OO
way	,O
like	OO
by	OO
color	.O
now	,U
really	OO
young	OO
kids	OO
struggle	OO
with	OO
this	.O
three	OU
and	OO
four	OO
year	OO
olds	OO
will	OO
usually	OO
keep	OO
sorting	OO
the	OO
cards	OO
in	OO
the	OO
old	OO
way	OO
no	OO
matter	OO
how	OO
many	OO
times	OO
you	OO
remind	OO
them	OO
of	OO
what	OO
they	OO
should	OO
be	OO
doing	.O
woman:	OU
if	OU
it's	OO
blue	,O
put	OO
it	OO
here	.O
if	OU
it's	OO
red	,O
put	OO
it	OO
here	.O
here's	OU
a	OO
blue	OO
one	.O
ok	,U
so	OO
now	OO
we're	OO
going	OO
to	OO
play	OO
a	OO
different	OO
game	.O
we're	OU
not	OO
going	OO
to	OO
play	OO
the	OO
color	OO
game	OO
anymore	.O
now	OU
we're	OO
going	OO
to	OO
play	OO
the	OO
shape	OO
game	,O
and	OO
in	OO
the	OO
shape	OO
game	,O
all	OO
the	OO
stars	OO
go	OO
here	OO
and	OO
all	OO
the	OO
trucks	OO
go	OO
here	,O
ok	?U
stars	OU
go	OO
here	,O
trucks	OO
go	OO
here	.O
where	OU
do	OO
the	OO
stars	OO
go	?O
and	OU
where	OO
do	OO
the	OO
trucks	OO
go	?O
excellent	.U
ok	,U
stars	OO
go	OO
here	,O
trucks	OO
go	OO
here	.O
here's	OU
a	OO
truck	.O
stars	OU
go	OO
here	,O
trucks	OO
go	OO
here	.O
here's	OU
a	OO
star	.O
sb:	OU
so	OU
it's	OO
really	OO
compelling	,O
and	OO
it's	OO
really	OO
obvious	OO
when	OO
she	OO
fails	OO
to	OO
use	OO
her	OO
executive	OO
function	.O
but	OU
here's	OO
the	OO
thing:	OO
we	OO
could	OO
train	OO
her	OO
on	OO
this	OO
task	OO
and	OO
others	OO
like	OO
it	OO
and	OO
eventually	OO
she'd	OO
improve	,O
but	OO
does	OO
that	OO
mean	OO
that	OO
she	OO
would've	OO
improved	OO
her	OO
executive	OO
function	OO
outside	OO
of	OO
the	OO
lab	?O
no	,U
because	OO
in	OO
the	OO
real	OO
world	,O
she'll	OO
need	OO
to	OO
use	OO
executive	OO
function	OO
to	OO
do	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
more	OO
than	OO
switching	OO
between	OO
shape	OO
and	OO
color	.O
she'll	OU
need	OO
to	OO
switch	OO
from	OO
adding	OO
to	OO
multiplying	OO
or	OO
from	OO
playing	OO
to	OO
tidying	OO
up	OO
or	OO
from	OO
thinking	OO
about	OO
her	OO
own	OO
feelings	OO
to	OO
thinking	OO
about	OO
her	OO
friend	.O
and	OU
success	OO
in	OO
real	OO
world	OO
situations	OO
depends	OO
on	OO
things	OO
like	OO
how	OO
motivated	OO
you	OO
are	OO
and	OO
what	OO
your	OO
peers	OO
are	OO
doing	.O
and	OU
it	OO
also	OO
depends	OO
on	OO
the	OO
strategies	OO
that	OO
you	OO
execute	OO
when	OO
you're	OO
using	OO
executive	OO
function	OO
in	OO
a	OO
particular	OO
situation	.O
so	OU
what	OO
i'm	OU
saying	OO
is	OO
that	OO
context	OO
really	OO
matters	.O
now	OU
let	OO
me	OO
give	OO
you	OO
an	OO
example	OO
from	OO
my	OO
research	.O
i	OU
recently	OO
brought	OO
in	OO
a	OO
bunch	OO
of	OO
kids	OO
to	OO
do	OO
the	OO
classic	OO
marshmallow	OO
test	,O
which	OO
is	OO
a	OO
measure	OO
of	OO
delay	OO
of	OO
gratification	OO
that	OO
also	OO
likely	OO
requires	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
executive	OO
function	.O
so	OU
you	OO
may	OO
have	OO
heard	OO
about	OO
this	OO
test	,O
but	OO
basically	,O
kids	OO
are	OO
given	OO
a	OO
choice	.O
they	OU
can	OO
have	OO
one	OO
marshmallow	OO
right	OO
away	,O
or	OO
if	OO
they	OO
can	OO
wait	OO
for	OO
me	OO
to	OO
go	OO
to	OO
the	OO
other	OO
room	OO
and	OO
get	OO
more	OO
marshmallows	,O
they	OO
can	OO
have	OO
two	OO
instead	.O
now	,U
most	OO
kids	OO
really	OO
want	OO
that	OO
second	OO
marshmallow	,O
but	OO
the	OO
key	OO
question	OO
is:	OO
how	OU
long	OO
can	OO
they	OO
wait	?O
now	,U
i	OU
added	OO
a	OO
twist	OO
to	OO
look	OO
at	OO
the	OO
effects	OO
of	OO
context	.O
i	OU
told	OO
each	OO
kid	OO
that	OO
they	OO
were	OO
in	OO
a	OO
group	,O
like	OO
the	OO
green	OO
group	,O
and	OO
i	OU
even	OO
gave	OO
them	OO
a	OO
green	OO
t	OU
shirt	OO
to	OO
wear	.O
and	OU
i	OU
said	,O
your	OU
group	OO
waited	OO
for	OO
two	OO
marshmallows	,O
and	OO
this	OO
other	OO
group	,O
the	OO
orange	OO
group	,O
did	OO
not	.O
or	OU
i	OU
said	OO
the	OO
opposite:	OO
your	OU
group	OO
didn't	OO
wait	OO
for	OO
two	OO
marshmallows	OO
and	OO
this	OO
other	OO
group	OO
did	.O
and	OU
then	OO
i	OU
left	OO
the	OO
kid	OO
alone	OO
in	OO
the	OO
room	OO
and	OO
i	OU
watched	OO
on	OO
a	OO
webcam	OO
to	OO
see	OO
how	OO
long	OO
they	OO
waited	.O
so	OU
what	OO
i	OU
found	OO
was	OO
that	OO
kids	OO
who	OO
believed	OO
that	OO
their	OO
group	OO
waited	OO
for	OO
two	OO
marshmallows	OO
were	OO
themselves	OO
more	OO
likely	OO
to	OO
wait	.O
so	OU
they	OO
were	OO
influenced	OO
by	OO
a	OO
peer	OO
group	OO
that	OO
they'd	OO
never	OO
even	OO
met	.O
pretty	OU
cool	,O
isn't	OO
it	?O
well	,U
so	OO
with	OO
this	OO
result	OO
i	OU
still	OO
didn't	OO
know	OO
if	OO
they	OO
were	OO
just	OO
copying	OO
their	OO
group	OO
or	OO
if	OO
it	OO
was	OO
something	OO
deeper	OO
than	OO
that	.O
so	OU
i	OU
brought	OO
in	OO
some	OO
more	OO
kids	,O
and	OO
after	OO
the	OO
marshmallow	OO
test	,O
i	OU
showed	OO
them	OO
pictures	OO
of	OO
pairs	OO
of	OO
kids	,O
and	OO
i	OU
told	OO
them	,O
one	OU
of	OO
these	OO
kids	OO
likes	OO
to	OO
have	OO
things	OO
right	OO
away	,O
like	OO
cookies	OO
and	OO
stickers	.O
and	OU
the	OO
other	OO
kid	OO
likes	OO
to	OO
wait	OO
so	OO
that	OO
they	OO
can	OO
have	OO
more	OO
of	OO
these	OO
things	.O
and	OU
then	OO
i	OU
asked	OO
them	,O
which	OU
one	OO
of	OO
these	OO
two	OO
kids	OO
do	OO
you	OO
like	OO
more	OO
and	OO
who	OO
would	OO
you	OO
want	OO
to	OO
play	OO
with	?O
and	OU
what	OO
i	OU
found	OO
was	OO
that	OO
kids	OO
who	OO
believed	OO
that	OO
their	OO
group	OO
waited	OO
tended	OO
to	OO
prefer	OO
other	OO
kids	OO
who	OO
liked	OO
to	OO
wait	OO
for	OO
things	.O
so	OU
learning	OO
what	OO
their	OO
group	OO
did	OO
made	OO
them	OO
value	OO
waiting	OO
more	.O
and	OU
not	OO
only	OO
that	,O
these	OO
kids	OO
likely	OO
used	OO
executive	OO
function	OO
to	OO
generate	OO
strategies	OO
to	OO
help	OO
themselves	OO
wait	,O
like	OO
sitting	OO
on	OO
their	OO
hands	OO
or	OO
turning	OO
away	OO
from	OO
the	OO
marshmallow	OO
or	OO
singing	OO
a	OO
song	OO
to	OO
distract	OO
themselves	.O
so	OU
what	OO
this	OO
all	OO
shows	OO
is	OO
just	OO
how	OO
much	OO
context	OO
matters	.O
it's	OU
not	OO
that	OO
these	OO
kids	OO
had	OO
good	OO
executive	OO
function	OO
or	OO
bad	,O
it's	OO
that	OO
the	OO
context	OO
helped	OO
them	OO
use	OO
it	OO
better	.O
so	OU
what	OO
does	OO
this	OO
mean	OO
for	OO
you	OO
and	OO
for	OO
your	OO
kids	?O
well	,U
let's	OO
say	OO
that	OO
you	OO
want	OO
to	OO
learn	OO
spanish	.U
you	OU
could	OO
try	OO
changing	OO
your	OO
context	OO
and	OO
surrounding	OO
yourself	OO
with	OO
other	OO
people	OO
who	OO
also	OO
want	OO
to	OO
learn	,O
and	OO
even	OO
better	OO
if	OO
these	OO
are	OO
people	OO
that	OO
you	OO
really	OO
like	.O
that	OU
way	OO
you'll	OO
be	OO
more	OO
motivated	OO
to	OO
use	OO
executive	OO
function	.O
or	OU
let's	OO
say	OO
that	OO
you	OO
want	OO
to	OO
help	OO
your	OO
child	OO
do	OO
better	OO
on	OO
her	OO
math	OO
homework	.O
you	OU
could	OO
teach	OO
her	OO
strategies	OO
to	OO
use	OO
executive	OO
function	OO
in	OO
that	OO
particular	OO
context	,O
like	OO
putting	OO
her	OO
phone	OO
away	OO
before	OO
she	OO
starts	OO
studying	OO
or	OO
planning	OO
to	OO
reward	OO
herself	OO
after	OO
studying	OO
for	OO
an	OO
hour	.O
now	,U
i	OU
don't	OO
want	OO
to	OO
make	OO
it	OO
sound	OO
like	OO
context	OO
is	OO
everything	.O
executive	OU
function	OO
is	OO
really	OO
complex	,O
and	OO
it's	OO
shaped	OO
by	OO
numerous	OO
factors	.O
but	OU
what	OO
i	OU
want	OO
you	OO
to	OO
remember	OO
is	OO
if	OO
you	OO
want	OO
to	OO
improve	OO
your	OO
executive	OO
function	OO
in	OO
some	OO
aspect	OO
of	OO
your	OO
life	,O
don't	OO
look	OO
for	OO
quick	OO
fixes	.O
think	OU
about	OO
the	OO
context	OO
and	OO
how	OO
you	OO
can	OO
make	OO
your	OO
goals	OO
matter	OO
more	OO
to	OO
you	,O
and	OO
how	OO
you	OO
can	OO
use	OO
strategies	OO
to	OO
help	OO
yourself	OO
in	OO
that	OO
particular	OO
situation	.O
i	OU
think	OO
the	OO
ancient	OO
greeks	OU
said	OO
it	OO
best	OO
when	OO
they	OO
said	,O
know	OU
thyself	.O
and	OU
a	OO
key	OO
part	OO
of	OO
this	OO
is	OO
knowing	OO
how	OO

your	OO
behavior	OO
and	OO
how	OO
you	OO
can	OO
use	OO
that	OO

nanahuatl	,U

this	OU

for	OO

today	.O
from	OU
this	OO

it	OO

only	OO

not	OU

i	OU
tell	OO
you	OO
about	OO
the	OO
wonderfully	OO
good	OO
things	OO
that	OO
happen	OO
when	OO
you	OO
get	OO
sleep	,O
but	OO
the	OO
alarmingly	OO
bad	OO
things	OO
that	OO
happen	OO
when	OO
you	OO
don't	OO
get	OO
enough	,O
both	OO
for	OO
your	OO
brain	OO
and	OO
for	OO
your	OO
body	.O
let	OU
me	OO
start	OO
with	OO
the	OO
brain	OO
and	OO
the	OO
functions	OO
of	OO
learning	OO
and	OO
memory	,O
because	OO
what	OO
we've	OO
discovered	OO
over	OO
the	OO
past	OO
10	OO
or	OO
so	OO
years	OO
is	OO
that	OO
you	OO
need	OO
sleep	OO
after	OO
learning	OO
to	OO
essentially	OO
hit	OO
the	OO
save	OO
button	OO
on	OO
those	OO
new	OO
memories	OO
so	OO
that	OO
you	OO
don't	OO
forget	.O
but	OU
recently	,O
we	OO
discovered	OO
that	OO
you	OO
also	OO
need	OO
sleep	OO
before	OO
learning	OO
to	OO
actually	OO
prepare	OO
your	OO
brain	,O
almost	OO
like	OO
a	OO
dry	OO
sponge	OO
ready	OO
to	OO
initially	OO
soak	OO
up	OO
new	OO
information	.O
and	OU
without	OO
sleep	,O
the	OO
memory	OO
circuits	OO
of	OO
the	OO
brain	OO
essentially	OO
become	OO
waterlogged	,O
as	OO
it	OO
were	,O
and	OO
you	OO
can't	OO
absorb	OO
new	OO
memories	.O
so	OU
let	OO
me	OO
show	OO
you	OO
the	OO
data	.O
here	OU
in	OO
this	OO
study	,O
we	OO
decided	OO
to	OO
test	OO
the	OO
hypothesis	OO
that	OO
pulling	OO
the	OO
all	OO
nighter	OO
was	OO
a	OO
good	OO
idea	.O
so	OU
we	OO
took	OO
a	OO
group	OO
of	OO
individuals	OO
and	OO
we	OO
assigned	OO
them	OO
to	OO
one	OO
of	OO
two	OO
experimental	OO
groups:	OO
a	OO
sleep	OO
group	OO
and	OO
a	OO
sleep	OO
deprivation	OO
group	.O
now	OU
the	OO
sleep	OO
group	,O
they're	OO
going	OO
to	OO
get	OO
a	OO
full	OO
eight	OO
hours	OO
of	OO
slumber	,O
but	OO
the	OO
deprivation	OO
group	,O
we're	OO
going	OO
to	OO
keep	OO
them	OO
awake	OO
in	OO
the	OO
laboratory	,O
under	OO
full	OO
supervision	.O
there's	OU
no	OO
naps	OO
or	OO
caffeine	,O
by	OO
the	OO
way	,O
so	OO
it's	OO
miserable	OO
for	OO
everyone	OO
involved	.O
and	OU
then	OO
the	OO
next	OO
day	,O
we're	OO
going	OO
to	OO
place	OO
those	OO
participants	OO
inside	OO
an	OO
mri	OU
scanner	OO
and	OO
we're	OO
going	OO
to	OO
have	OO
them	OO
try	OO
and	OO
learn	OO
a	OO
whole	OO
list	OO
of	OO
new	OO
facts	OO
as	OO
we're	OO
taking	OO
snapshots	OO
of	OO
brain	OO
activity	.O
and	OU
then	OO
we're	OO
going	OO
to	OO
test	OO
them	OO
to	OO
see	OO
how	OO
effective	OO
that	OO
learning	OO
has	OO
been	.O
and	OU
that's	OO
what	OO
you're	OO
looking	OO
at	OO
here	OO
on	OO
the	OO
vertical	OO
axis	.O
and	OU
when	OO
you	OO
put	OO
those	OO
two	OO
groups	OO
head	OO
to	OO
head	,O
what	OO
you	OO
find	OO
is	OO
a	OO
quite	OO
significant	,O
40	OO
percent	OO
deficit	OO
in	OO
the	OO
ability	OO
of	OO
the	OO
brain	OO
to	OO
make	OO
new	OO
memories	OO
without	OO
sleep	.O
i	OU
think	OO
this	OO
should	OO
be	OO
concerning	,O
considering	OO
what	OO
we	OO
know	OO
is	OO
happening	OO
to	OO
sleep	OO
in	OO
our	OO
education	OO
populations	OO
right	OO
now	.O
in	OU
fact	,O
to	OO
put	OO
that	OO
in	OO
context	,O
it	OO
would	OO
be	OO
the	OO
difference	OO
in	OO
a	OO
child	OO
acing	OO
an	OO
exam	OO
versus	OO
failing	OO
it	OO
miserably	OO
—	OO
40	OO
percent	.O
and	OU
we've	OO
gone	OO
on	OO
to	OO
discover	OO
what	OO
goes	OO
wrong	OO
within	OO
your	OO
brain	OO
to	OO
produce	OO
these	OO
types	OO
of	OO
learning	OO
disabilities	.O
and	OU
there's	OO
a	OO
structure	OO
that	OO
sits	OO
on	OO
the	OO
left	OO
and	OO
the	OO
right	OO
side	OO
of	OO
your	OO
brain	,O
called	OO
the	OO
hippocampus	.O
and	OU
you	OO
can	OO
think	OO
of	OO
the	OO
hippocampus	OO
almost	OO
like	OO
the	OO
informational	OO
inbox	OO
of	OO
your	OO
brain	.O
it's	OU
very	OO
good	OO
at	OO
receiving	OO
new	OO
memory	OO
files	OO
and	OO
then	OO
holding	OO
on	OO
to	OO
them	.O
and	OU
when	OO
you	OO
look	OO
at	OO
this	OO
structure	OO
in	OO
those	OO
people	OO
who'd	OO
had	OO
a	OO
full	OO
night	OO
of	OO
sleep	,O
we	OO
saw	OO
lots	OO
of	OO
healthy	OO
learning	OO
related	OO
activity	.O
yet	OU
in	OO
those	OO
people	OO
who	OO
were	OO
sleep	OO
deprived	,O
we	OO
actually	OO
couldn't	OO
find	OO
any	OO
significant	OO
signal	OO
whatsoever	.O
so	OU
it's	OO
almost	OO
as	OO
though	OO
sleep	OO
deprivation	OO
had	OO
shut	OO
down	OO
your	OO
memory	OO
inbox	,O
and	OO
any	OO
new	OO
incoming	OO
files	OO
—	OO
they	OO
were	OO
just	OO
being	OO
bounced	.O
you	OU
couldn't	OO
effectively	OO
commit	OO
new	OO
experiences	OO
to	OO
memory	.O
so	OU
that's	OO
the	OO
bad	OO
that	OO
can	OO
happen	OO
if	OO
i	OU
were	OO
to	OO
take	OO
sleep	OO
away	OO
from	OO
you	,O
but	OO
let	OO
me	OO
just	OO
come	OO
back	OO
to	OO
that	OO
control	OO
group	OO
for	OO
a	OO
second	.O
do	OU
you	OO
remember	OO
those	OO
folks	OO
that	OO
got	OO
a	OO
full	OO
eight	OO
hours	OO
of	OO
sleep	?O
well	,U
we	OO
can	OO
ask	OO
a	OO
very	OO
different	OO
question:	OO
what	OU
is	OO
it	OO
about	OO
the	OO
physiological	OO
quality	OO
of	OO
your	OO
sleep	OO
when	OO
you	OO
do	OO
get	OO
it	OO
that	OO
restores	OO
and	OO
enhances	OO
your	OO
memory	OO
and	OO
learning	OO
ability	OO
each	OO
and	OO
every	OO
day	?O
and	OU
by	OO
placing	OO
electrodes	OO
all	OO
over	OO
the	OO
head	,O
what	OO
we've	OO
discovered	OO
is	OO
that	OO
there	OO
are	OO
big	,O
powerful	OO
brainwaves	OO
that	OO
happen	OO
during	OO
the	OO
very	OO
deepest	OO
stages	OO
of	OO
sleep	OO
that	OO
have	OO
riding	OO
on	OO
top	OO
of	OO
them	OO
these	OO
spectacular	OO
bursts	OO
of	OO
electrical	OO
activity	OO
that	OO
we	OO
call	OO
sleep	OO
spindles	.O
and	OU
it's	OO
the	OO
combined	OO
quality	OO
of	OO
these	OO
deep	OO
sleep	OO
brainwaves	OO
that	OO
acts	OO
like	OO
a	OO
file	OO
transfer	OO
mechanism	OO
at	OO
night	,O
shifting	OO
memories	OO
from	OO
a	OO
short	OO
term	OO
vulnerable	OO
reservoir	OO
to	OO
a	OO
more	OO
permanent	OO
long	OO
term	OO
storage	OO
site	OO
within	OO
the	OO
brain	,O
and	OO
therefore	OO
protecting	OO
them	,O
making	OO
them	OO
safe	.O
and	OU
it	OO
is	OO
important	OO
that	OO
we	OO
understand	OO
what	OO
during	OO
sleep	OO
actually	OO
transacts	OO
these	OO
memory	OO
benefits	,O
because	OO
there	OO
are	OO
real	OO
medical	OO
and	OO
societal	OO
implications	.O
and	OU
let	OO
me	OO
just	OO
tell	OO
you	OO
about	OO
one	OO
area	OO
that	OO
we've	OO
moved	OO
this	OO
work	OO
out	OO
into	,O
clinically	,O
which	OO
is	OO
the	OO
context	OO
of	OO
aging	OO
and	OO
dementia	.O
because	OU
it's	OO
of	OO
course	OO
no	OO
secret	OO
that	,O
as	OO
we	OO
get	OO
older	,O
our	OO
learning	OO
and	OO
memory	OO
abilities	OO
begin	OO
to	OO
fade	OO
and	OO
decline	.O
but	OU
what	OO
we've	OO
also	OO
discovered	OO
is	OO
that	OO
a	OO
physiological	OO
signature	OO
of	OO
aging	OO
is	OO
that	OO
your	OO
sleep	OO
gets	OO
worse	,O
especially	OO
that	OO
deep	OO
quality	OO
of	OO
sleep	OO
that	OO
i	OU
was	OO
just	OO
discussing	.O
and	OU
only	OO
last	OO
year	,O
we	OO
finally	OO
published	OO
evidence	OO
that	OO
these	OO
two	OO
things	,O
they're	OO
not	OO
simply	OO
co	OO
occurring	,O
they	OO
are	OO
significantly	OO
interrelated	.O
and	OU
it	OO
suggests	OO
that	OO
the	OO
disruption	OO
of	OO
deep	OO
sleep	OO
is	OO
an	OO
underappreciated	OO
factor	OO
that	OO
is	OO
contributing	OO
to	OO
cognitive	OO
decline	OO
or	OO
memory	OO
decline	OO
in	OO
aging	,O
and	OO
most	OO
recently	OO
we've	OO
discovered	,O
in	OO
alzheimer's	OU
disease	OO
as	OO
well	.O
now	,U
i	OU
know	OO
this	OO
is	OO
remarkably	OO
depressing	OO
news	.O
it's	OU
in	OO
the	OO
mail	.O
it's	OU
coming	OO
at	OO
you	.O
but	OU
there's	OO
a	OO
potential	OO
silver	OO
lining	OO
here	.O
unlike	OU
many	OO
of	OO
the	OO
other	OO
factors	OO
that	OO
we	OO
know	OO
are	OO
associated	OO
with	OO
aging	,O
for	OO
example	OO
changes	OO
in	OO
the	OO
physical	OO
structure	OO
of	OO
the	OO
brain	,O
that's	OO
fiendishly	OO
difficult	OO
to	OO
treat	.O
but	OU
that	OO
sleep	OO
is	OO
a	OO
missing	OO
piece	OO
in	OO
the	OO
explanatory	OO
puzzle	OO
of	OO
aging	OO
and	OO
alzheimer's	OU
is	OO
exciting	OO
because	OO
we	OO
may	OO
be	OO
able	OO
to	OO
do	OO
something	OO
about	OO
it	.O
and	OU
one	OO
way	OO
that	OO
we	OO
are	OO
approaching	OO
this	OO
at	OO
my	OO
sleep	OO
center	OO
is	OO
not	OO
by	OO
using	OO
sleeping	OO
pills	,O
by	OO
the	OO
way	.O
unfortunately	,U
they	OO
are	OO
blunt	OO
instruments	OO
that	OO
do	OO
not	OO
produce	OO
naturalistic	OO
sleep	.O
instead	,U
we're	OO
actually	OO
developing	OO
a	OO
method	OO
based	OO
on	OO
this	.O
it's	OU
called	OO
direct	OO
current	OO
brain	OO
stimulation	.O
you	OU
insert	OO
a	OO
small	OO
amount	OO
of	OO
voltage	OO
into	OO
the	OO
brain	,O
so	OO
small	OO
you	OO
typically	OO
don't	OO
feel	OO
it	,O
but	OO
it	OO
has	OO
a	OO
measurable	OO
impact	.O
now	OU
if	OO
you	OO
apply	OO
this	OO
stimulation	OO
during	OO
sleep	OO
in	OO
young	,O
healthy	OO
adults	,O
as	OO
if	OO
you're	OO
sort	OO
of	OO
singing	OO
in	OO
time	OO
with	OO
those	OO
deep	OO
sleep	OO
brainwaves	,O
not	OO
only	OO
can	OO
you	OO
amplify	OO
the	OO
size	OO
of	OO
those	OO
deep	OO
sleep	OO
brainwaves	,O
but	OO
in	OO
doing	OO
so	,O
we	OO
can	OO
almost	OO
double	OO
the	OO
amount	OO
of	OO
memory	OO
benefit	OO
that	OO
you	OO
get	OO
from	OO
sleep	.O
the	OU
question	OO
now	OO
is	OO
whether	OO
we	OO
can	OO
translate	OO
this	OO
same	OO
affordable	,O
potentially	OO
portable	OO
piece	OO
of	OO
technology	OO
into	OO
older	OO
adults	OO
and	OO
those	OO
with	OO
dementia	.O
can	OU
we	OO
restore	OO
back	OO
some	OO
healthy	OO
quality	OO
of	OO
deep	OO
sleep	,O
and	OO
in	OO
doing	OO
so	,O
can	OO
we	OO
salvage	OO
aspects	OO
of	OO
their	OO
learning	OO
and	OO
memory	OO
function	?O
that	OU
is	OO
my	OO
real	OO
hope	OO
now	.O
that's	OU
one	OO
of	OO
our	OO
moon	OO
shot	OO
goals	,O
as	OO
it	OO
were	.O
so	OU
that's	OO
an	OO
example	OO
of	OO
sleep	OO
for	OO
your	OO
brain	,O
but	OO
sleep	OO
is	OO
just	OO
as	OO
essential	OO
for	OO
your	OO
body	.O
we've	OU
already	OO
spoken	OO
about	OO
sleep	OO
loss	OO
and	OO
your	OO
reproductive	OO
system	.O
or	OU
i	OU
could	OO
tell	OO
you	OO
about	OO
sleep	OO
loss	OO
and	OO
your	OO
cardiovascular	OO
system	,O
and	OO
that	OO
all	OO
it	OO
takes	OO
is	OO
one	OO
hour	.O
because	OU
there	OO
is	OO
a	OO
global	OO
experiment	OO
performed	OO
on	OO
1.6	OO
billion	OO
people	OO
across	OO
70	OO
countries	OO
twice	OO
a	OO
year	,O
and	OO
it's	OO
called	OO
daylight	OO
saving	OO
time	.O
now	,U
in	OO
the	OO
spring	,O
when	OO
we	OO
lose	OO
one	OO
hour	OO
of	OO
sleep	,O
we	OO
see	OO
a	OO
subsequent	OO
24	OO
percent	OO
increase	OO
in	OO
heart	OO
attacks	OO
that	OO
following	OO
day	.O
in	OU
the	OO
autumn	,O
when	OO
we	OO
gain	OO
an	OO
hour	OO
of	OO
sleep	,O
we	OO
see	OO
a	OO
21	OO
percent	OO
reduction	OO
in	OO
heart	OO
attacks	.O
isn't	OU
that	OO
incredible	?O
and	OU
you	OO
see	OO
exactly	OO
the	OO
same	OO
profile	OO
for	OO
car	OO
crashes	,O
road	OO
traffic	OO
accidents	,O
even	OO
suicide	OO
rates	.O
but	OU
as	OO
a	OO
deeper	OO
dive	,O
i	OU
want	OO
to	OO
focus	OO
on	OO
this:	OO
sleep	OO
loss	OO
and	OO
your	OO
immune	OO
system	.O
and	OU
here	,O
i'll	OU
introduce	OO
these	OO
delightful	OO
blue	OO
elements	OO
in	OO
the	OO
image	.O
they	OU
are	OO
called	OO
natural	OO
killer	OO
cells	,O
and	OO
you	OO
can	OO
think	OO
of	OO
natural	OO
killer	OO
cells	OO
almost	OO
like	OO
the	OO
secret	OO
service	OO
agents	OO
of	OO
your	OO
immune	OO
system	.O
they	OU
are	OO
very	OO
good	OO
at	OO
identifying	OO
dangerous	,O
unwanted	OO
elements	OO
and	OO
eliminating	OO
them	.O
in	OU
fact	,O
what	OO
they're	OO
doing	OO
here	OO
is	OO
destroying	OO
a	OO
cancerous	OO
tumor	OO
mass	.O
so	OU
what	OO
you	OO
wish	OO
for	OO
is	OO
a	OO
virile	OO
set	OO
of	OO
these	OO
immune	OO
assassins	OO
at	OO
all	OO
times	,O
and	OO
tragically	,O
that's	OO
what	OO
you	OO
don't	OO
have	OO
if	OO
you're	OO
not	OO
sleeping	OO
enough	.O
so	OU
here	OO
in	OO
this	OO
experiment	,O
you're	OO
not	OO
going	OO
to	OO
have	OO
your	OO
sleep	OO
deprived	OO
for	OO
an	OO
entire	OO
night	,O
you're	OO
simply	OO
going	OO
to	OO
have	OO
your	OO
sleep	OO
restricted	OO
to	OO
four	OO
hours	OO
for	OO
one	OO
single	OO
night	,O
and	OO
then	OO
we're	OO
going	OO
to	OO
look	OO
to	OO
see	OO
what's	OO
the	OO
percent	OO
reduction	OO
in	OO
immune	OO
cell	OO
activity	OO
that	OO
you	OO
suffer	.O
and	OU
it's	OO
not	OO

—	OO
it's	OO
not	OO
10	OO

it's	OO

that's	OU
a	OO

and	OO
you	OO
can	OO

why	OO
we're	OO

in	OU

the	OO
link	OO
between	OO
a	OO

that	OO

so	OU
you	OO

advice	.O
we	OU
know	OO
this	OO
from	OO
epidemiological	OO
studies	OO
across	OO

of	OO

there's	OU
a	OO
simple	OO
truth:	OO
the	OO

your	OO

the	OO
shorter	OO
your	OO
life	.O

predicts	OO
all	OO

of	OO

or	OO
even	OO
alzheimer's	OU

were	OO
not	OO
sufficiently	OO
disquieting	,O
we	OO
have	OO
since	OO
discovered	OO
that	OO
a	OO

of	OO

will	OO
even	OO
erode	OO
the	OO
very	OO
fabric	OO
of	OO

life	OO
itself	,O
your	OO
dna	OU
genetic	OO

so	OU
here	OO
in	OO
this	OO
study	,O
they	OO
took	OO
a	OO
group	OO
of	OO
healthy	OO
adults	OO
and	OO
they	OO
limited	OO
them	OO
to	OO
six	OO
hours	OO
of	OO
sleep	OO
a	OO
night	OO
for	OO
one	OO
week	,O
and	OO
then	OO
they	OO
measured	OO
the	OO
change	OO
in	OO
their	OO
gene	OO

profile	OO
relative	OO
to	OO
when	OO
those	OO

individuals	OO
were	OO
getting	OO
a	OO
full	OO
eight	OO
hours	OO
of	OO
sleep	OO
a	OO
night	.O
and	OU
there	OO
were	OO
two	OO
critical	OO
findings	.O
first	,U
a	OO
sizable	OO
and	OO
significant	OO
711	OO
genes	OO
were	OO
distorted	OO
in	OO
their	OO
activity	,O
caused	OO
by	OO
a	OO
lack	OO
of	OO
sleep	.O
the	OU
second	OO
result	OO
was	OO
that	OO
about	OO
half	OO
of	OO
those	OO
genes	OO
were	OO
actually	OO
increased	OO
in	OO
their	OO
activity	.O
the	OU
other	OO
half	OO
were	OO
decreased	.O
now	OU
those	OO
genes	OO
that	OO
were	OO
switched	OO
off	OO
by	OO
a	OO
lack	OO
of	OO
sleep	OO
were	OO
genes	OO
associated	OO
with	OO
your	OO
immune	OO
system	,O
so	OO
once	OO
again	,O
you	OO
can	OO
see	OO
that	OO
immune	OO
deficiency	.O
in	OU
contrast	,O
those	OO
genes	OO
that	OO
were	OO
actually	OO
upregulated	OO
or	OO
increased	OO
by	OO
way	OO
of	OO
a	OO
lack	OO
of	OO
sleep	,O
were	OO
genes	OO
associated	OO
with	OO
the	OO
promotion	OO
of	OO

genes	OO
associated	OO
with	OO
long	OO

chronic	OO
inflammation	OO
within	OO
the	OO

and	OO
genes	OO
associated	OO
with	OO

and	,O
as	OO
a	OO
consequence	,O
cardiovascular	OO
disease	.O
there	OU
is	OO
simply	OO
no	OO
aspect	OO
of	OO
your	OO

that	OO
can	OO
retreat	OO
at	OO
the	OO
sign	OO
of	OO

and	OO
get	OO
away	OO
unscathed	.O
it's	OU
rather	OO
like	OO
a	OO

in	OO
your	OO

will	OO
leak	OO
down	OO
into	OO

of	OO

that	OO

out	OO
your	OO

and	OU
at	OO
this	OO
point	,O
you	OO
may	OO
be	OO
thinking	,O
oh	OU
my	OO
goodness	,O
how	OO
do	OO
i	OU
start	OO
to	OO
get	OO
better	OO
sleep	?O
what	OU
are	OO
you	OO
tips	OO
for	OO
good	OO
sleep	?O
well	,U
beyond	OO
avoiding	OO
the	OO
damaging	OO
and	OO
harmful	OO
impact	OO
of	OO
alcohol	OO
and	OO
caffeine	OO
on	OO
sleep	,O
and	OO
if	OO
you're	OO
struggling	OO
with	OO
sleep	OO
at	OO
night	,O
avoiding	OO
naps	OO
during	OO
the	OO
day	,O
i	OU
have	OO
two	OO
pieces	OO
of	OO
advice	OO
for	OO
you	.O
the	OU
first	OO
is	OO
regularity	.O
go	OU
to	OO
bed	OO
at	OO
the	OO
same	OO
time	,O
wake	OO
up	OO
at	OO
the	OO
same	OO
time	,O
no	OO
matter	OO
whether	OO
it's	OO
the	OO
weekday	OO
or	OO
the	OO
weekend	.O
regularity	OU
is	OO
king	,O
and	OO
it	OO
will	OO
anchor	OO
your	OO
sleep	OO
and	OO
improve	OO
the	OO
quantity	OO
and	OO
the	OO
quality	OO
of	OO
that	OO
sleep	.O
the	OU
second	OO
is	OO
keep	OO
it	OO
cool	.O
your	OU
body	OO
needs	OO
to	OO
drop	OO
its	OO
core	OO
temperature	OO
by	OO
about	OO
two	OO
to	OO
three	OO
degrees	OO
fahrenheit	OU
to	OO
initiate	OO
sleep	OO
and	OO
then	OO
to	OO
stay	OO
asleep	,O
and	OO
it's	OO
the	OO
reason	OO
you	OO
will	OO
always	OO
find	OO
it	OO
easier	OO
to	OO
fall	OO
asleep	OO
in	OO
a	OO
room	OO
that's	OO
too	OO
cold	OO
than	OO
too	OO
hot	.O
so	OU
aim	OO
for	OO
a	OO
bedroom	OO
temperature	OO
of	OO
around	OO
65	OO
degrees	,O
or	OO
about	OO
18	OO
degrees	OO
celsius	.U
that's	OU
going	OO
to	OO
be	OO
optimal	OO
for	OO
the	OO
sleep	OO
of	OO
most	OO
people	.O
and	OU
then	OO
finally	,O
in	OO
taking	OO
a	OO
step	OO
back	,O
then	,O
what	OO
is	OO
the	OO
mission	OO
critical	OO
statement	OO
here	?O
well	,U
i	OU
think	OO
it	OO
may	OO
be	OO
this:	OO
sleep	,O
unfortunately	,O
is	OO
not	OO
an	OO
optional	OO
lifestyle	OO
luxury	.O
sleep	OU
is	OO
a	OO
nonnegotiable	OO
biological	OO
necessity	.O
it	OU
is	OO
your	OO
life	OO
support	OO
system	,O
and	OO
it	OO
is	OO
mother	OU
nature's	OU
best	OO
effort	OO
yet	OO
at	OO
immortality	.O
and	OU
the	OO
decimation	OO
of	OO
sleep	OO
throughout	OO
industrialized	OO
nations	OO
is	OO
having	OO
a	OO
catastrophic	OO
impact	OO
on	OO
our	OO
health	,O
our	OO
wellness	,O
even	OO
the	OO
safety	OO
and	OO
the	OO
education	OO
of	OO
our	OO
children	.O
it's	OU
a	OO
silent	OO
sleep	OO
loss	OO
epidemic	,O
and	OO
it's	OO
fast	OO
becoming	OO
one	OO
of	OO
the	OO
greatest	OO
public	OO
health	OO
challenges	OO
that	OO
we	OO
face	OO
in	OO
the	OO
21st	OO
century	.O
i	OU
believe	OO
it	OO
is	OO
now	OO
time	OO
for	OO
us	OO
to	OO
reclaim	OO
our	OO
right	OO
to	OO
a	OO
full	OO
night	OO
of	OO
sleep	,O
and	OO
without	OO
embarrassment	OO
or	OO
that	OO
unfortunate	OO
stigma	OO
of	OO
laziness	.O
and	OU
in	OO
doing	OO
so	,O
we	OO
can	OO
be	OO
reunited	OO
with	OO
the	OO
most	OO
powerful	OO
elixir	OO
of	OO
life	,O
the	OO
swiss	OU
army	OU
knife	OO
of	OO
health	,O
as	OO
it	OO
were	.O
and	OU
with	OO
that	OO
soapbox	OO
rant	OO
over	,O
i	OU
will	OO
simply	OO
say	,O
good	OO
night	,O
good	OO
luck	,O
and	OO
above	OO
all	.O
i	OU
do	OO
hope	OO
you	OO
sleep	OO
well	.O
thank	OU
you	OO
very	OO
much	OO
indeed	.O
thank	OU
you	.O
thank	OU
you	OO
so	OO
much	.O
david	OU
biello:	OU
no	,U
no	,O
no	.O
stay	OU
there	OO
for	OO
a	OO
second	.O
good	OU
job	OO
not	OO
running	OO
away	,O
though	.O
i	OU
appreciate	OO
that	.O
so	OU
that	OO
was	OO
terrifying	.O
matt	OU
walker:	OU
you're	OU
welcome	.O
db:	OU
yes	,U
thank	OO
you	,O
thank	OO
you	.O
since	OU
we	OO
can't	OO
catch	OO
up	OO
on	OO
sleep	,O
what	OO
are	OO
we	OO
supposed	OO
to	OO
do	?O
what	OU
do	OO
we	OO
do	OO
when	OO
we're	,O
like	,O
tossing	OO
and	OO
turning	OO
in	OO
bed	OO
late	OO
at	OO
night	OO
or	OO
doing	OO
shift	OO
work	OO
or	OO
whatever	OO
else	?O
mw:	OU
so	OU
you're	OO
right	,O
we	OO
can't	OO
catch	OO
up	OO
on	OO
sleep	.O
sleep	OU
is	OO
not	OO
like	OO
the	OO
bank	.O
you	OU
can't	OO
accumulate	OO
a	OO
debt	OO
and	OO
then	OO
hope	OO
to	OO
pay	OO
it	OO
off	OO
at	OO
a	OO
later	OO
point	OO
in	OO
time	.O
i	OU
should	OO
also	OO
note	OO
the	OO
reason	OO
that	OO
it's	OO
so	OO
catastrophic	OO
and	OO
that	OO
our	OO
health	OO
deteriorates	OO
so	OO
quickly	,O
first	,O
it's	OO
because	OO
human	OO
beings	OO
are	OO
the	OO
only	OO
species	OO
that	OO
deliberately	OO
deprive	OO
themselves	OO
of	OO
sleep	OO
for	OO
no	OO
apparent	OO
reason	.O
db:	OU
because	OU
we're	OO
smart	.O
mw:	OU
and	OU
i	OU
make	OO
that	OO
point	OO
because	OO
it	OO
means	OO
that	OO
mother	OU
nature	,U
throughout	OO
the	OO
course	OO
of	OO
evolution	,O
has	OO
never	OO
had	OO
to	OO
face	OO
the	OO
challenge	OO
of	OO
this	OO
thing	OO
called	OO
sleep	OO
deprivation	.O
so	OU
she's	OO
never	OO
developed	OO
a	OO
safety	OO
net	,O
and	OO
that's	OO
why	OO
when	OO
you	OO
undersleep	,O
things	OO
just	OO
sort	OO
of	OO
implode	OO
so	OO
quickly	,O
both	OO
within	OO
the	OO
brain	OO
and	OO
the	OO
body	.O
so	OU
you	OO
just	OO
have	OO
to	OO
prioritize	.O
db:	OU
ok	,U
but	OO
tossing	OO
and	OO
turning	OO
in	OO
bed	,O
what	OO
do	OO
i	OU
do	?O
mw:	OU
so	OU
if	OO
you	OO
are	OO
staying	OO
in	OO
bed	OO
awake	OO
for	OO
too	OO
long	,O
you	OO
should	OO
get	OO
out	OO
of	OO
bed	OO
and	OO
go	OO
to	OO
a	OO
different	OO
room	OO
and	OO
do	OO
something	OO
different	.O
the	OU
reason	OO
is	OO
because	OO
your	OO
brain	OO
will	OO
very	OO
quickly	OO
associate	OO
your	OO
bedroom	OO
with	OO
the	OO
place	OO
of	OO
wakefulness	,O
and	OO
you	OO
need	OO
to	OO
break	OO
that	OO
association	.O
so	OU
only	OO
return	OO
to	OO
bed	OO
when	OO
you	OO
are	OO
sleepy	,O
and	OO
that	OO
way	OO
you	OO
will	OO
relearn	OO
the	OO
association	OO
that	OO
you	OO
once	OO
had	,O
which	OO
is	OO
your	OO
bed	OO
is	OO
the	OO
place	OO
of	OO
sleep	.O
so	OU
the	OO
analogy	OO
would	OO
be	,O
you'd	OO
never	OO
sit	OO
at	OO
the	OO
dinner	OO
table	,O
waiting	OO
to	OO
get	OO
hungry	,O
so	OO
why	OO
would	OO
you	OO
lie	OO
in	OO
bed	,O
waiting	OO
to	OO
get	OO
sleepy	?O
db:	OU
well	,U
thank	OO
you	OO
for	OO
that	OO
wake	OO
up	OO
call	.O
great	OU
job	,O
matt	.U
mw:	OU
you're	OU
very	OO
welcome	.O
thank	OU
you	OO
very	OO
much	.O
hello	.U
i'm	OU
not	OO
a	OO
real	OO
person	.O
i'm	OU
actually	OO
a	OO
copy	OO
of	OO
a	OO
real	OO
person	.O
although	,U
i	OU
feel	OO
like	OO
a	OO
real	OO
person	.O
it's	OU
kind	OO
of	OO
hard	OO
to	OO
explain	.O
hold	OU
on	OO
—	OO
i	OU
think	OO
i	OU
saw	OO
a	OO
real	OO
person	.O
there's	OO
one	.O
let's	OU
bring	OO
him	OO
onstage	.O
hello	.U
what	OU
you	OO
see	OO
up	OO
there	OO
is	OO
a	OO
digital	OO
human	.O
i'm	OU
wearing	OO
an	OO
inertial	OO
motion	OO
capture	OO
suit	OO
that's	OO
figuring	OO
what	OO
my	OO
body	OO
is	OO
doing	.O
and	OU
i've	OU
got	OO
a	OO
single	OO
camera	OO
here	OO
that's	OO
watching	OO
my	OO
face	OO
and	OO
feeding	OO
some	OO
machine	OO
learning	OO
software	OO
that's	OO
taking	OO
my	OO
expressions	,O
like	,O
hm	,U
hm	,O
hm	,O
and	OO
transferring	OO
it	OO
to	OO
that	OO
guy	.O
we	OU
call	OO
him	OO
digidoug	.U
he's	OU
actually	OO
a	OO
3	OO
d	OU
character	OO
that	OO
i'm	OU
controlling	OO
live	OO
in	OO
real	OO
time	.O
so	,U
i	OU
work	OO
in	OO
visual	OO
effects	.O
and	OU
in	OO
visual	OO
effects	,O
one	OO
of	OO
the	OO
hardest	OO
things	OO
to	OO
do	OO
is	OO
to	OO
create	OO
believable	,O
digital	OO
humans	OO
that	OO
the	OO
audience	OO
accepts	OO
as	OO
real	.O
people	OU
are	OO
just	OO
really	OO
good	OO
at	OO
recognizing	OO
other	OO
people	.O
go	OU
figure	.O
so	,U
that's	OO
ok	,U
we	OO
like	OO
a	OO
challenge	.O
over	OU
the	OO
last	OO
15	OO
years	,O
we've	OO
been	OO
putting	OO
humans	OO
and	OO
creatures	OO
into	OO
film	OO
that	OO
you	OO
accept	OO
as	OO
real	.O
if	OU
they're	OO
happy	,O
you	OO
should	OO
feel	OO
happy	.O
and	OU
if	OO
they	OO
feel	OO
pain	,O
you	OO
should	OO
empathize	OO
with	OO
them	.O
we're	OU
getting	OO
pretty	OO
good	OO
at	OO
it	,O
too	.O
but	OU
it's	OO
really	,O
really	OO
difficult	.O
effects	OU
like	OO
these	OO
take	OO
thousands	OO
of	OO
hours	OO
and	OO
hundreds	OO
of	OO
really	OO
talented	OO
artists	.O
but	OU
things	OO
have	OO
changed	.O
over	OU
the	OO
last	OO
five	OO
years	,O
computers	OO
and	OO
graphics	OO
cards	OO
have	OO
gotten	OO
seriously	OO
fast	.O
and	OU
machine	OO
learning	,O
deep	OO
learning	,O
has	OO
happened	.O
so	OU
we	OO
asked	OO
ourselves:	OO
do	OU
you	OO
suppose	OO
we	OO
could	OO
create	OO
a	OO
photo	OO
realistic	OO
human	,O
like	OO
we're	OO
doing	OO
for	OO
film	,O
but	OO
where	OO
you're	OO
seeing	OO
the	OO
actual	OO
emotions	OO
and	OO
the	OO
details	OO
of	OO
the	OO
person	OO
who's	OO
controlling	OO
the	OO
digital	OO
human	OO
in	OO
real	OO
time	?O
in	OU
fact	,O
that's	OO
our	OO
goal:	OO
if	OU
you	OO
were	OO
having	OO
a	OO
conversation	OO
with	OO
digidoug	OU
one	OO
on	OO
one	,O
is	OO
it	OO
real	OO
enough	OO
so	OO
that	OO
you	OO
could	OO
tell	OO
whether	OO
or	OO
not	OO
i	OU
was	OO
lying	OO
to	OO
you	?O
so	OU
that	OO
was	OO
our	OO
goal	.O
about	OU
a	OO
year	OO
and	OO
a	OO
half	OO
ago	,O
we	OO
set	OO
off	OO
to	OO
achieve	OO
this	OO
goal	.O
what	OU
i'm	OU
going	OO
to	OO
do	OO
now	OO
is	OO
take	OO
you	OO
basically	OO
on	OO
a	OO
little	OO
bit	OO
of	OO
a	OO
journey	OO
to	OO
see	OO
exactly	OO
what	OO
we	OO
had	OO
to	OO
do	OO
to	OO
get	OO
where	OO
we	OO
are	.O
we	OU
had	OO
to	OO
capture	OO
an	OO
enormous	OO
amount	OO
of	OO
data	.O
in	OU
fact	,O
by	OO
the	OO
end	OO
of	OO
this	OO
thing	,O
we	OO
had	OO
probably	OO
one	OO
of	OO
the	OO
largest	OO
facial	OO
data	OO
sets	OO
on	OO
the	OO
planet	.O
of	OU
my	OO
face	.O
why	OU
me	?O
well	,U
i'll	OU
do	OO
just	OO
about	OO
anything	OO
for	OO

me	.O
i	OU

come	OO
on	.O
we	OU
had	OO
to	OO
first	OO
figure	OO
out	OO
what	OO
my	OO
face	OO
actually	OO
looked	OO
like	.O
not	OU
just	OO
a	OO
photograph	OO
or	OO
a	OO
3	OO

but	OO
what	OO
it	OO
actually	OO
looked	OO
like	OO
in	OO
any	OO
photograph	,O
how	OO
light	OO
interacts	OO
with	OO
my	OO
skin	.O
luckily	OU
for	OO
us	,O
about	OO
three	OO
blocks	OO
away	OO
from	OO
our	OO
los	OU
angeles	OU
studio	OO
is	OO
this	OO

they're	OU
a	OO
research	OO
lab	OO
that's	OO
associated	OO
with	OO
the	OO
university	OU
of	OO

they	OU
have	OO
a	OO
device	OO
there	,O
it's	OO
called	OO
the	OO
light	OO
stage	.O
it	OU
has	OO
a	OO
zillion	OO
individually	OO
controlled	OO
lights	OO
and	OO
a	OO
whole	OO
bunch	OO
of	OO
cameras	.O
and	OU
with	OO
that	,O
we	OO
can	OO
reconstruct	OO
my	OO
face	OO
under	OO
a	OO
myriad	OO
of	OO
lighting	OO
conditions	.O
we	OU
even	OO
captured	OO
the	OO
blood	OO
flow	OO
and	OO
how	OO
my	OO
face	OO
changes	OO
when	OO
i	OU
make	OO
expressions	.O
this	OU
let	OO
us	OO
build	OO
a	OO
model	OO
of	OO
my	OO
face	OO
that	,O
quite	OO
frankly	,O
is	OO
just	OO
amazing	.O
it's	OU
got	OO
an	OO
unfortunate	OO
level	OO
of	OO
detail	,O
unfortunately	.O
you	OU
can	OO
see	OO
every	OO
pore	,O
every	OO
wrinkle	.O
but	OU
we	OO
had	OO
to	OO
have	OO
that	.O
reality	OU
is	OO
all	OO
about	OO
detail	.O
and	OU
without	OO
it	,O
you	OO
miss	OO
it	.O
we	OU
are	OO
far	OO
from	OO
done	,O
though	.O
this	OU
let	OO
us	OO
build	OO
a	OO
model	OO
of	OO
my	OO
face	OO
that	OO
looked	OO
like	OO
me	.O
but	OU
it	OO
didn't	OO
really	OO
move	OO
like	OO
me	.O
and	OU
that's	OO
where	OO
machine	OO
learning	OO
comes	OO
in	.O
and	OU
machine	OO
learning	OO
needs	OO
a	OO
ton	OO
of	OO
data	.O
so	OU
i	OU
sat	OO
down	OO
in	OO
front	OO
of	OO
some	OO
high	OO
resolution	OO
motion	OO
capturing	OO
device	.O
and	OU
also	,O
we	OO
did	OO
this	OO
traditional	OO
motion	OO
capture	OO
with	OO
markers	.O
we	OU
created	OO
a	OO
whole	OO
bunch	OO
of	OO
images	OO
of	OO
my	OO
face	OO
and	OO
moving	OO
point	OO
clouds	OO
that	OO
represented	OO
that	OO
shapes	OO
of	OO
my	OO
face	.O
man	,U
i	OU
made	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
expressions	,O
i	OU
said	OO
different	OO
lines	OO
in	OO
different	OO
emotional	OO
states	.O
we	OU
had	OO
to	OO
do	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
capture	OO
with	OO
this	.O
once	OU
we	OO
had	OO
this	OO
enormous	OO
amount	OO
of	OO
data	,O
we	OO
built	OO
and	OO
trained	OO
deep	OO
neural	OO
networks	.O
and	OU
when	OO
we	OO
were	OO
finished	OO
with	OO
that	,O
in	OO
16	OO
milliseconds	,O
the	OO
neural	OO
network	OO
can	OO
look	OO
at	OO
my	OO
image	OO
and	OO
figure	OO
out	OO
everything	OO
about	OO
my	OO
face	.O
it	OU
can	OO
compute	OO
my	OO
expression	,O
my	OO
wrinkles	,O
my	OO
blood	OO
flow	OO
—	OO
even	OO
how	OO
my	OO
eyelashes	OO
move	.O
this	OU
is	OO
then	OO
rendered	OO
and	OO
displayed	OO
up	OO
there	OO
with	OO
all	OO
the	OO
detail	OO
that	OO
we	OO
captured	OO
previously	.O
we're	OU
far	OO
from	OO
done	.O
this	OU
is	OO
very	OO
much	OO
a	OO
work	OO
in	OO
progress	.O
this	OU
is	OO
actually	OO
the	OO
first	OO
time	OO
we've	OO
shown	OO
it	OO
outside	OO
of	OO
our	OO
company	.O
and	,U
you	OO
know	,O
it	OO
doesn't	OO
look	OO
as	OO
convincing	OO
as	OO
we	OO
want;	OO
i've	OU
got	OO
wires	OO
coming	OO
out	OO
of	OO
the	OO
back	OO
of	OO
me	,O
and	OO
there's	OO
a	OO
sixth	OO
of	OO
a	OO
second	OO
delay	OO
between	OO
when	OO
we	OO
capture	OO
the	OO
video	OO
and	OO
we	OO
display	OO
it	OO
up	OO
there	.O
sixth	OU
of	OO
a	OO
second	OO
—	OO
that's	OO
crazy	OO
good	.O
but	OU
it's	OO
still	OO
why	OO
you're	OO
hearing	OO
a	OO
bit	OO
of	OO
an	OO
echo	OO
and	OO
stuff	.O
and	OU
you	OO
know	,O
this	OO
machine	OO
learning	OO
stuff	OO
is	OO
brand	OO
new	OO
to	OO
us	,O
sometimes	OO
it's	OO
hard	OO
to	OO
convince	OO
to	OO
do	OO
the	OO
right	OO
thing	,O
you	OO
know	?O
it	OU
goes	OO
a	OO
little	OO
sideways	.O
but	OU
why	OO
did	OO
we	OO
do	OO
this	?O
well	,U
there's	OO
two	OO
reasons	,O
really	.O
first	OU
of	OO
all	,O
it	OO
is	OO
just	OO
crazy	OO
cool	.O
how	OU
cool	OO
is	OO
it	?O
well	,U
with	OO
the	OO
push	OO
of	OO
a	OO
button	,O
i	OU
can	OO
deliver	OO
this	OO
talk	OO
as	OO
a	OO
completely	OO
different	OO
character	.O
this	OU
is	OO
elbor	.U
we	OU
put	OO
him	OO
together	OO
to	OO
test	OO
how	OO
this	OO
would	OO
work	OO
with	OO
a	OO
different	OO
appearance	.O
and	OU
the	OO
cool	OO
thing	OO
about	OO
this	OO
technology	OO
is	OO
that	,O
while	OO
i've	OU
changed	OO
my	OO
character	,O
the	OO
performance	OO
is	OO
still	OO
all	OO
me	.O
i	OU
tend	OO
to	OO
talk	OO
out	OO
of	OO
the	OO
right	OO
side	OO
of	OO
my	OO
mouth;	OO
so	OO
does	OO
elbor	.U
now	,U
the	OO
second	OO
reason	OO
we	OO
did	OO
this	,O
and	OO
you	OO
can	OO
imagine	,O
is	OO
this	OO
is	OO
going	OO
to	OO
be	OO
great	OO
for	OO
film	.O
this	OU
is	OO
a	OO
brand	OO
new	,O
exciting	OO
tool	OO
for	OO
artists	OO
and	OO
directors	OO
and	OO
storytellers	.O
it's	OU
pretty	OO
obvious	,O
right	?O
i	OU
mean	,O
this	OO
is	OO
going	OO
to	OO
be	OO
really	OO
neat	OO
to	OO
have	.O
but	OU
also	,O
now	OO
that	OO
we've	OO
built	OO
it	,O
it's	OO
clear	OO
that	OO
this	OO
is	OO
going	OO
to	OO
go	OO
way	OO
beyond	OO
film	.O
but	OU
wait	.O
didn't	OU
i	OU
just	OO
change	OO
my	OO
identity	OO
with	OO
the	OO
push	OO
of	OO
a	OO
button	?O
isn't	OU
this	OO
like	OO
deepfake	OO
and	OO
face	OO
swapping	OO
that	OO
you	OO
guys	OO
may	OO
have	OO
heard	OO
of	?O
well	,U
yeah	.O
in	OU
fact	,O
we	OO
are	OO
using	OO
some	OO
of	OO
the	OO
same	OO
technology	OO
that	OO
deepfake	OO
is	OO
using	.O
deepfake	OU
is	OO
2	OO
d	OU
and	OO
image	OO
based	,O
while	OO
ours	OO
is	OO
full	OO
3	OO
d	OU
and	OO
way	OO
more	OO
powerful	.O
but	OU
they're	OO
very	OO
related	.O
and	OU
now	OO
i	OU
can	OO
hear	OO
you	OO
thinking	,O
darn	OU
it	.O
i	OU
though	OO
i	OU
could	OO
at	OO
least	OO
trust	OO
and	OO
believe	OO
in	OO
video	.O
if	OU
it	OO
was	OO
live	OO
video	,O
didn't	OO
it	OO
have	OO
to	OO
be	OO
true	?O
well	,U
we	OO
know	OO
that's	OO
not	OO
really	OO
the	OO
case	,O
right	?O
even	OU
without	OO
this	,O
there	OO
are	OO
simple	OO
tricks	OO
that	OO
you	OO
can	OO
do	OO
with	OO
video	OO
like	OO
how	OO
you	OO
frame	OO
a	OO
shot	OO
that	OO
can	OO
make	OO
it	OO
really	OO
misrepresent	OO
what's	OO
actually	OO
going	OO
on	.O
and	OU
i've	OU
been	OO
working	OO
in	OO
visual	OO
effects	OO
for	OO
a	OO
long	OO
time	,O
and	OO
i've	OU
known	OO
for	OO
a	OO
long	OO
time	OO
that	OO
with	OO
enough	OO
effort	,O
we	OO
can	OO
fool	OO
anyone	OO
about	OO
anything	.O
what	OU
this	OO
stuff	OO
and	OO
deepfake	OO
is	OO
doing	OO
is	OO
making	OO
it	OO
easier	OO
and	OO
more	OO
accessible	OO
to	OO
manipulate	OO
video	,O
just	OO
like	OO
photoshop	OU
did	OO
for	OO
manipulating	OO
images	,O
some	OO
time	OO
ago	.O
i	OU
prefer	OO
to	OO
think	OO
about	OO
how	OO
this	OO
technology	OO
could	OO
bring	OO
humanity	OO
to	OO
other	OO
technology	OO
and	OO
bring	OO
us	OO
all	OO
closer	OO
together	.O
now	OU
that	OO
you've	OO
seen	OO
this	,O
think	OO
about	OO
the	OO
possibilities	.O
right	OU
off	OO
the	OO
bat	,O
you're	OO
going	OO
to	OO
see	OO
it	OO
in	OO
live	OO
events	OO
and	OO
concerts	,O
like	OO
this	.O
digital	OU
celebrities	,O
especially	OO
with	OO
new	OO
projection	OO
technology	,O
are	OO
going	OO
to	OO
be	OO
just	OO
like	OO
the	OO
movies	,O
but	OO
alive	OO
and	OO
in	OO
real	OO
time	.O
and	OU
new	OO
forms	OO
of	OO
communication	OO
are	OO
coming	.O
you	OU
can	OO
already	OO
interact	OO
with	OO
digidoug	OU
in	OO
vr	.U
and	OU
it	OO
is	OO
eye	OO
opening	.O
it's	OU
just	OO
like	OO
you	OO
and	OO
i	OU
are	OO
in	OO
the	OO
same	OO
room	,O
even	OO
though	OO
we	OO
may	OO
be	OO
miles	OO
apart	.O
heck	,U
the	OO
next	OO
time	OO
you	OO
make	OO
a	OO
video	OO
call	,O
you	OO
will	OO
be	OO
able	OO
to	OO
choose	OO
the	OO
version	OO
of	OO
you	OO
you	OO
want	OO
people	OO
to	OO
see	.O
it's	OU
like	OO
really	,O
really	OO
good	OO
makeup	.O
i	OU
was	OO
scanned	OO
about	OO
a	OO
year	OO
and	OO
a	OO
half	OO
ago	.O
i've	OU
aged	.O
digidoug	OU
hasn't	.O
on	OU
video	OO
calls	,O
i	OU
never	OO
have	OO
to	OO
grow	OO
old	.O
and	OU
as	OO
you	OO
can	OO
imagine	,O
this	OO
is	OO
going	OO
to	OO
be	OO
used	OO
to	OO
give	OO
virtual	OO
assistants	OO
a	OO
body	OO
and	OO
a	OO
face	.O
a	OU
humanity	.O
i	OU
already	OO
love	OO
it	OO
that	OO
when	OO
i	OU
talk	OO
to	OO
virtual	OO
assistants	,O
they	OO
answer	OO
back	OO
in	OO
a	OO
soothing	,O
humanlike	OO
voice	.O
now	OU
they'll	OO
have	OO
a	OO
face	.O
and	OU
you'll	OO
get	OO
all	OO
the	OO
nonverbal	OO
cues	OO
that	OO
make	OO
communication	OO
so	OO
much	OO
easier	.O
it's	OU
going	OO
to	OO
be	OO
really	OO
nice	.O
you'll	OU
be	OO
able	OO
to	OO
tell	OO
when	OO
a	OO
virtual	OO
assistant	OO
is	OO
busy	OO
or	OO
confused	OO
or	OO
concerned	OO
about	OO
something	.O
now	,U
i	OU
couldn't	OO
leave	OO
the	OO
stage	OO
without	OO
you	OO
actually	OO
being	OO
able	OO
to	OO
see	OO
my	OO
real	OO
face	,O
so	OO
you	OO
can	OO
do	OO
some	OO
comparison	.O
so	OU
let	OO
me	OO
take	OO
off	OO
my	OO
helmet	OO
here	.O
yeah	,U
don't	OO
worry	,O
it	OO
looks	OO
way	OO
worse	OO
than	OO
it	OO
feels	.O
so	OU
this	OO
is	OO
where	OO
we	OO
are	.O
let	OU
me	OO
put	OO
this	OO
back	OO
on	OO
here	.O
doink	.U
so	OU
this	OO
is	OO
where	OO
we	OO
are	.O
we're	OU
on	OO
the	OO
cusp	OO
of	OO
being	OO
able	OO
to	OO
interact	OO
with	OO
digital	OO
humans	OO
that	OO
are	OO
strikingly	OO
real	,O
whether	OO
they're	OO
being	OO
controlled	OO
by	OO
a	OO
person	OO
or	OO
a	OO
machine	.O
and	OU
like	OO
all	OO
new	OO
technology	OO
these	OO
days	,O
it's	OO
going	OO
to	OO
come	OO
with	OO
some	OO
serious	OO
and	OO
real	OO
concerns	OO
that	OO
we	OO
have	OO
to	OO
deal	OO
with	.O
but	OU
i	OU
am	OO
just	OO
so	OO
really	OO
excited	OO
about	OO
the	OO
ability	OO
to	OO
bring	OO
something	OO
that	OO
i've	OU
seen	OO
only	OO
in	OO
science	OO
fiction	OO
for	OO
my	OO
entire	OO
life	OO
into	OO
reality	.O
communicating	OU
with	OO
computers	OO
will	OO
be	OO
like	OO
talking	OO
to	OO
a	OO
friend	.O
and	OU
talking	OO
to	OO
faraway	OO
friends	OO
will	OO
be	OO
like	OO
sitting	OO
with	OO
them	OO
together	OO
in	OO
the	OO

thank	OU
you	OO
very	OO
much	.O
it’s	OU
late	,O
pitch	OO
dark	,O
and	OO
a	OO
self	OO
driving	OO

winds	OO
down	OO
a	OO
narrow	OO

suddenly	,U
three	OO
hazards	OO
appear	OO
at	OO
the	OO

what	OU
happens	OO
next	?O
before	OU
it	OO
can	OO

this	OO

of	OO

the	OO

to	OO
detect	OO
them—	OO
gleaning	OO
enough	OO

about	OO
their	OO

so	OO
that	OO

the	OO

the	OO

that’ll	OO

no	OO

the	OO

how	OO

it	OO

all	OO
in	OO
a	OO

that’s	OU
a	OO
tall	OO
order	,O
but	OO
there’s	OO
a	OO
solution	OO
that	OO
partners	OO
two	OO
things:	OO
a	OO
special	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
laser	OO
based	OO
probe	OO
called	OO
lidar	,U
and	OO
a	OO
miniature	OO
version	OO
of	OO
the	OO

technology	OO
that	OO
keeps	OO
the	OO
internet	OO
humming	,O
called	OO
integrated	OO
photonics	.O
to	OU
understand	OO
lidar	,U
it	OO
helps	OO
to	OO
start	OO
with	OO
a	OO
related	OO
technology—	OO
radar	.O
in	OU
aviation	,O
radar	OO
antennas	OO
launch	OO
pulses	OO
of	OO
radio	OO
or	OO
microwaves	OO
at	OO
planes	OO
to	OO
learn	OO
their	OO
locations	OO
by	OO
timing	OO
how	OO
long	OO
the	OO
beams	OO
take	OO
to	OO
bounce	OO
back	.O
that’s	OU
a	OO
limited	OO
way	OO
of	OO
seeing	,O
though	,O
because	OO
the	OO
large	OO
beam	OO
size	OO
can’t	OO
visualize	OO
fine	OO
details	.O
in	OU
contrast	,O
a	OO
self	OO
driving	OO
car’s	OO
lidar	OU
system	,O
which	OO
stands	OO
for	OO
light	OU
detection	OU
and	OO
ranging	,U

a	OO

as	OO
the	OO

on	OO
a	OO

across	OO
the	OO

but	OU
how	OO
do	OO
we	OO
determine	OO
the	OO
shape	,O
or	OO
depth	,O
of	OO
these	OO
features	?O
lidar	OU
fires	OO
a	OO

the	OO

the	OU

to	OO

i'd	OU
like	OO
to	OO
introduce	OO
you	OO
to	OO
an	OO
interesting	OO
person	OO
named	OO
ötzi	.U
he	OU
lives	OO
in	OO
italy	OU
at	OO
the	OO
south	OU
tyrol	OU
museum	OU
of	OO
archaeology	OU
because	OO
he's	OO
a	OO
mummy	.O
this	OU
is	OO
an	OO
artist's	OO
rendition	OO
of	OO
what	OO
he	OO
might	OO
have	OO
looked	OO
like	OO
when	OO
he	OO
was	OO
alive	OO
5,300	OO
years	OO
ago	.O
you	OU
want	OO
to	OO
see	OO
what	OO
he	OO
looks	OO
like	OO
today	?O
ok	,U
brace	OO
yourselves	,O
gross	OO
mummy	OO
pic	OO
coming	OO
at	OO
you	.O
so	,U
he's	OO
not	OO
as	OO
handsome	OO
as	OO
he	OO
used	OO
to	OO
be	,O
but	OO
he's	OO
actually	OO
in	OO
great	OO
shape	OO
for	OO
a	OO
mummy	OO
because	OO
he	OO
was	OO
discovered	OO
frozen	OO
in	OO
ice	.O
ötzi	OU
is	OO
the	OO
oldest	OO
mummy	OO
that's	OO
been	OO
discovered	OO
with	OO
preserved	OO
skin	.O
5,300	OO
years	OO
is	OO
super	OO
old	,O
older	OO
than	OO
the	OO
egyptian	OU
pyramids	,O
and	OO
ötzi's	OU
skin	OO
is	OO
covered	OO
in	OO
61	OO
black	OO
tattoos	,O
all	OO
lines	OO
and	OO
crosses	OO
on	OO
parts	OO
of	OO
his	OO
body	OO
where	OO
he	OO
might	OO
have	OO
experienced	OO
pain	.O
so	OU
scientists	OO
think	OO
that	OO
they	OO
might	OO
have	OO
been	OO
used	OO
to	OO
mark	OO
sites	OO
for	OO
some	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
therapy	,O
like	OO
acupuncture	.O
so	OU
clearly	,O
if	OO
the	OO
oldest	OO
skin	OO
we've	OO
seen	OO
is	OO
all	OO
tattooed	OO
up	,O
tattooing	OO
is	OO
a	OO
very	OO
ancient	OO
practice	.O
but	OU
fast	OO
forward	OO
to	OO
today	OO
and	OO
tattoos	OO
are	OO
everywhere	.O
almost	OU
one	OO
in	OO
four	OO
americans	OU
has	OO
a	OO
tattoo	,O
it's	OO
a	OO
multibillion	OO
dollar	OO
industry	,O
and	OO
whether	OO
you	OO
love	OO
tattoos	OO
or	OO
hate	OO
them	,O
this	OO
talk	OO
will	OO
change	OO
the	OO
way	OO
you	OO
think	OO
about	OO
them	.O
so	,U
why	OO
are	OO
tattoos	OO
so	OO
popular	?O
unlike	OU
ötzi	,U
most	OO
of	OO
us	OO
today	OO
use	OO
tattoos	OO
for	OO
some	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
self	OO
expression	.O
personally	,U
i	OU
love	OO
tattoos	OO
because	OO
i	OU
love	OO
art	OO
and	OO
there	OO
is	OO
something	OO
so	OO
wonderful	OO
to	OO
me	,O
almost	OO
romantic	,O
about	OO
the	OO
way	OO
a	OO
tattoo	OO
as	OO
an	OO
art	OO
form	OO
cannot	OO
be	OO
commodified	.O
right	?U
your	OU
tattoo	OO
lives	OO
and	OO
dies	OO
with	OO
you	.O
it	OU
can't	OO
be	OO
bought	OO
or	OO
sold	OO
or	OO
traded	,O
so	OO
its	OO
only	OO
value	OO
is	OO
really	OO
personal	OO
to	OO
you	,O
and	OO
i	OU
love	OO
that	.O
now	,U
i	OU
tend	OO
to	OO
gravitate	OO
towards	OO
really	OO
colorful	OO
tattoos	OO
because	OO
i'm	OU
obsessed	OO
with	OO
color	.O
i	OU
teach	OO
a	OO
whole	OO
course	OO
on	OO
it	OO
at	OO
my	OO
university	.O
but	OU
my	OO
very	OO
first	OO
tattoo	OO
was	OO
an	OO
all	OO
black	OO
tattoo	OO
like	OO
ötzi's	.U
yep	,U
i	OU
did	OO
that	OO
clichéd	OO
thing	OO
that	OO
young	OO
people	OO
do	OO
sometimes	OO
and	OO
i	OU
got	OO
a	OO
tattoo	OO
in	OO
a	OO
language	OO
i	OU
can't	OO
even	OO
read	.O
ok	,U
but	OO
i	OU
was	OO
19	OO
years	OO
old	,O
i	OU
had	OO
just	OO
returned	OO
from	OO
my	OO
first	OO
trip	OO
overseas	,O
i	OU
was	OO
in	OO
japan	OU
in	OO
the	OO
mountains	OO
meditating	OO
in	OO
buddhist	OU
monasteries	,O
and	OO
it	OO
was	OO
a	OO
really	OO
meaningful	OO
experience	OO
to	OO
me	,O
so	OO
i	OU
wanted	OO
to	OO
commemorate	OO
it	OO
with	OO
this	OO
japanese	OU
and	OO
chinese	OU
character	OO
for	OO
mountain	.O
now	,U
here's	OO
what	OO
blows	OO
my	OO
mind	.O
my	OU
14	OO
year	OO
old	OO
tattoo	OO
and	OO
ötzi's	OU
5,300	OO
year	OO
old	OO
tattoos	OO
are	OO
made	OO
of	OO
the	OO
same	OO
exact	OO
stuff:	OO
soot	,O
that	OO
black	OO
powdery	OO
carbon	OO
dust	OO
that	OO
gets	OO
left	OO
behind	OO
in	OO
the	OO
fireplace	OO
when	OO
you	OO
burn	OO
stuff	.O
and	OU
if	OO
you	OO
zoom	OO
way	,O
way	OO
in	OO
on	OO
either	OO
my	OO
tattoo	OO
or	OO
ötzi's	OU
tattoos	,O
you'll	OO
find	OO
that	OO
they	OO
all	OO
look	OO
something	OO
like	OO
this	.O
a	OU
tattoo	OO
is	OO
nothing	OO
more	OO
than	OO
a	OO
bunch	OO
of	OO
tiny	OO
pigment	OO
particles	,O
soot	OO
in	OO
this	OO
case	,O
that	OO
get	OO
trapped	OO
in	OO
the	OO
dermis	,O
which	OO
is	OO
the	OO
layer	OO
of	OO
tissue	OO
right	OO
underneath	OO
the	OO
surface	OO
of	OO
the	OO
skin	.O
so	OU
in	OO
over	OO
five	OO
thousand	OO
years	,O
we've	OO
done	OO
very	OO
little	OO
to	OO
update	OO
tattoo	OO
technology	,O
apart	OO
from	OO
getting	OO
access	OO
to	OO
more	OO
colors	OO
and	OO
slightly	OO
more	OO
efficient	OO
methods	OO
of	OO
installation	.O
while	OU
i'm	OU
an	OO
artist	,O
i'm	OU
also	OO
a	OO
scientist	,O
and	OO
i	OU
direct	OO
a	OO
laboratory	OO
that	OO
researches	OO
nanotechnology	,O
which	OO
is	OO
the	OO
science	OO
of	OO
building	OO
things	OO
with	OO
ultratiny	OO
building	OO
blocks	,O
thousands	OO
of	OO
times	OO
smaller	OO
even	OO
than	OO
the	OO
width	OO
of	OO
a	OO
human	OO
hair	.O
and	OU
i	OU
began	OO
to	OO
ask	OO
myself	,O
how	OO
could	OO
nanotechnology	OO
serve	OO
tattooing	?O
if	OU
tattoos	OO
are	OO
just	OO
a	OO
bunch	OO
of	OO
particles	OO
in	OO
the	OO
skin	,O
could	OO
we	OO
swap	OO
those	OO
particles	OO
out	OO
for	OO
ones	OO
that	OO
do	OO
something	OO
more	OO
interesting	?O
here's	OU
my	OO
big	OO
idea:	OO
i	OU
believe	OO
that	OO
tattoos	OO
can	OO
give	OO
you	OO
superpowers	.O
now	,U
i	OU
don't	OO
mean	OO
they're	OO
going	OO
to	OO
make	OO
us	OO
fly	,O
but	OO
i	OU
do	OO
think	OO
that	OO
we	OO
can	OO
have	OO
superpowers	OO
in	OO
the	OO
sense	OO
that	OO
tattoos	OO
can	OO
give	OO
us	OO
new	OO
abilities	OO
that	OO
we	OO
don't	OO
currently	OO
possess	.O
by	OU
upgrading	OO
the	OO
particles	,O
we	OO
can	OO
engineer	OO
tattooing	OO
so	OO
that	OO
it	OO
will	OO
change	OO
not	OO
only	OO
the	OO
appearance	OO
of	OO
our	OO
skin	,O
but	OO
also	OO
the	OO
function	OO
of	OO
our	OO
skin	.O
let	OU
me	OO
show	OO
you	.O
this	OU
is	OO
a	OO
diagram	OO
of	OO
a	OO
microcapsule	.O
it's	OU
a	OO
tiny	OO
hollow	OO
particle	OO
with	OO
a	OO
protective	OO
outer	OO
shell	,O
about	OO
the	OO
size	OO
of	OO
a	OO
tattoo	OO
pigment	,O
and	OO
you	OO
can	OO
fill	OO
the	OO
inside	OO
with	OO
practically	OO
whatever	OO
you	OO
want	.O
so	OU
what	OO
if	OO
we	OO
put	OO
interesting	OO
materials	OO
inside	OO
of	OO
these	OO
microcapsules	OO
and	OO
made	OO
tattoo	OO
inks	OO
with	OO
them	?O
what	OU
sorts	OO
of	OO
things	OO
could	OO
we	OO
make	OO
a	OO
tattoo	OO
do	?O
what	OU
problems	OO
could	OO
we	OO
solve	?O
what	OU
human	OO
limitations	OO
could	OO
we	OO
overcome	?O
well	,U
here's	OO
one	OO
idea:	OO
one	OO
of	OO
our	OO
weaknesses	OO
as	OO
humans	OO
is	OO
that	OO
we	OO
can't	OO
see	OO
ultraviolet	,O
or	OO
uv	,U
light	.O
that's	OU
the	OO
high	OO
energy	OO
part	OO
of	OO
sunlight	OO
that	OO
causes	OO
sunburn	OO
and	OO
increases	OO
our	OO
risk	OO
of	OO
skin	OO
cancer	.O
many	OU
animals	OO
and	OO
insects	OO
can	OO
actually	OO
see	OO
uv	OU
light	,O
but	OO
we	OO
can't	.O
if	OU
we	OO
could	,O
we'd	OO
be	OO
able	OO
to	OO
see	OO
sunscreen	OO
when	OO
it	OO
was	OO
applied	OO
on	OO
our	OO
skin	.O
unfortunately	,U
most	OO
of	OO
us	OO
don't	OO
wear	OO
sunscreen	,O
and	OO
those	OO
of	OO
us	OO
who	OO
do	OO
can't	OO
really	OO
tell	OO
when	OO
it	OO
wears	OO
off	,O
because	OO
it's	OO
invisible	.O
it's	OU
the	OO
main	OO
reason	OO
we	OO
treat	OO
over	OO
five	OO
million	OO
cases	OO
of	OO
preventable	OO
skin	OO
cancer	OO
every	OO
year	OO
in	OO
the	OO
us	OU
alone	,O
costing	OO
our	OO
economy	OO
over	OO
five	OO
billion	OO
dollars	OO
annually	.O
so	OU
how	OO
could	OO
we	OO
overcome	OO
this	OO
human	OO
weakness	OO
with	OO
a	OO
tattoo	?O
well	,U
if	OO
the	OO
problem	OO
is	OO
that	OO
we	OO
can't	OO
see	OO
uv	OU
rays	,O
maybe	OO
we	OO
can	OO
make	OO
a	OO
tattoo	OO
detect	OO
them	OO
for	OO
us	.O
so	OU
i	OU
thought	,O
why	OO
don't	OO
we	OO
take	OO
some	OO
microcapsules	,O
load	OO
it	OO
up	OO
with	OO
a	OO
uv	OU
sensitive	,O
color	OO
changing	OO
dye	,O
and	OO
make	OO
a	OO
tattoo	OO
ink	OO
out	OO
of	OO
that	?O
now	,U
one	OO
of	OO
the	OO
troubles	OO
of	OO
being	OO
a	OO
tattoo	OO
technologist	OO
is	OO
finding	OO
willing	OO
test	OO
subjects	.O
and	OU
when	OO
it	OO
came	OO
time	OO
to	OO
test	OO
this	OO
tattoo	OO
ink	,O
i	OU
thought	OO
it	OO
best	OO
not	OO
to	OO
torture	OO
my	OO
poor	OO
graduate	OO
students	.O
so	OU
i	OU
decided	OO
to	OO
tattoo	OO
a	OO
couple	OO
of	OO
spots	OO
on	OO
my	OO
own	OO
arm	OO
instead	.O
and	OU
it	OU
actually	OO
worked	.O
check	OU
it	OO
out	.O
i	OU
call	OO
these	OO
tattoos	OO
solar	OO
freckles	OO
because	OO
they're	OO
powered	OO
by	OO
sunshine	.O
and	OU
right	OO
now	,O
they're	OO
invisible	,O
but	OO
as	OO
soon	OO
as	OO
i	OU
expose	OO
them	OO
to	OO
a	OO
uv	OU
light	,O
acting	OO
as	OO
the	OO
sun	OU
—	OO
there	OO
they	OO
are	,O
blue	OO
spots	.O
now	,U
i'm	OU
not	OO
wearing	OO
sunscreen	OO
in	OO
this	OO
video	,O
but	OO
if	OO
i	OU
was	,O
those	OO
blue	OO
spots	OO
would	OO
not	OO
appear	,O
and	OO
then	OO
when	OO
my	OO
sunscreen	OO
wore	OO
off	OO
later	,O
the	OO
solar	OO
freckles	OO
would	OO
reappear	OO
in	OO
uv	OU
light	OO
and	OO
i	OU
would	OO
know	OO
that	OO
it	OO
was	OO
time	OO
to	OO
reapply	OO
sunscreen	.O
so	OU
these	OO
tattoos	OO
act	OO
as	OO
a	OO
real	OO
time	,O
naked	OO
eye	OO
indicator	OO
of	OO
your	OO
skin's	OO
uv	OU
exposure	.O
and	OU
of	OO
course	,O
i	OU
think	OO
there	OO
are	OO
lots	OO
of	OO
really	OO
cool	,O
artistic	OO
things	OO
you	OO
could	OO
do	OO
with	OO
a	OO
color	OO
changing	OO
tattoo	OO
like	OO
this	,O
but	OO
i	OU
hope	OO
that	OO
it	OO
will	OO
also	OO
help	OO
us	OO
solve	OO
a	OO
big	OO
problem	OO
in	OO
skin	OO
protection	.O
let	OU
me	OO
give	OO
you	OO
another	OO
example	.O
normal	OU
human	OO
body	OO
temperature	OO
is	OO
about	OO
97	OO
to	OO
99	OO
degrees	OO
fahrenheit	,U
and	OO
if	OO
you	OO
fall	OO
outside	OO
of	OO
that	OO
range	,O
you	OO
need	OO
to	OO
seek	OO
medical	OO
attention	OO
right	OO
away	.O
now	,U
the	OO
problem	OO
is	OO
that	OO
humans	OO
can't	OO
detect	OO
our	OO
own	OO
body	OO
temperature	OO
without	OO
a	OO
thermometer	.O
sure	,U
you	OO
could	OO
try	OO
the	OO
old	OO

trick	,O
but	OO
there's	OO
zero	OO
scientific	OO
evidence	OO
to	OO
back	OO
that	OO
up	.O
so	OU
what	OO
if	OO
we	OO
could	OO
create	OO
a	OO
tattooable	OO
thermometer	OO
that	OO
you	OO
could	OO
access	OO
anytime	?O
well	,U
remember	OO
how	OO
the	OO
solar	OO
freckles	OO
used	OO
a	OO
uv	OU
sensitive	OO
dye	OO
inside	OO
of	OO
the	OO
microcapsules	OO
of	OO
the	OO
tattoo	OO
ink	?O
well	,U
you	OO
could	OO
also	OO
put	OO
heat	OO
sensitive	OO
dyes	OO
inside	OO
of	OO
microcapsules	OO
and	OO
you	OO
could	OO
make	OO
different	OO
tattoo	OO
inks	OO
that	OO
change	OO
color	OO
at	OO
different	OO
temperatures	.O
suppose	OU
it	OO
was	OO
96	,O
98	,O
and	OO
a	OO
hundred	OO
degrees	OO
fahrenheit	.U
if	OU
you	OO
place	OO
those	OO
inks	OO
side	OO
by	OO
side	,O
now	OO
you	OO
have	OO
a	OO
temperature	OO
scale	OO
tuned	OO
to	OO
the	OO
human	OO
body	.O
in	OU
this	OO
video	,O
you	OO
can	OO
see	OO
the	OO
different	OO
patches	OO
of	OO
tattoos	OO
disappearing	OO
sequentially	OO
as	OO
the	OO
pigskin	OO
we	OO
tested	OO
them	OO
on	OO
is	OO
heated	OO
up	.O
so	OU
if	OO
you	OO
were	OO
to	OO
place	OO
a	OO
tattoo	OO
like	OO
this	OO
in	OO
a	OO
location	OO
that	OO
was	OO
stable	OO
to	OO
external	OO
temperature	OO
fluctuations	OO
—	OO
maybe	OO
inside	OO
of	OO
the	OO
mouth	,O
perhaps	OO
on	OO
the	OO
back	OO
of	OO
the	OO
lip	?O
—	OO
then	OO
you'd	OO
be	OO
able	OO
to	OO
read	OO
your	OO
body	OO
temperature	OO
anytime	OO
by	OO
just	OO
glancing	OO
at	OO
your	OO
tattoo	OO
in	OO
the	OO
mirror	.O
amazing	,U
right	?O
thank	OU
you	.O
another	OU
limitation	OO
that	OO
we	OO
have	OO
as	OO
humans	OO
is	OO
that	OO
our	OO
skin	OO
doesn't	OO
conduct	OO
electricity	,O
and	OO
that	OO
can	OO
be	OO
a	OO
good	OO
thing	,O
but	OO
not	OO
necessarily	OO
—	OO
if	OO
you	OO
have	OO
an	OO
electronic	OO
biomedical	OO
implant	,O
like	OO
a	OO
pacemaker	OO
for	OO
example	.O
right	OU
now	,O
if	OO
you	OO
have	OO
a	OO
pacemaker	,O
you	OO
need	OO
surgery	OO
every	OO
five	OO
or	OO
10	OO
years	OO
to	OO
replace	OO
the	OO
battery	OO
when	OO
it	OO
dies	.O
and	OU
wouldn't	OO
it	OO
be	OO
nice	OO
if	,O
instead	,O
we	OO
could	OO
simply	OO
recharge	OO
the	OO
battery	OO
through	OO
a	OO
patch	OO
of	OO
conducting	OO
skin	?O
well	,U
if	OO
you	OO
were	OO
to	OO
try	OO
to	OO
tackle	OO
that	OO
problem	OO
with	OO
a	OO
tattoo	,O
the	OO
first	OO
step	OO
would	OO
be	OO
to	OO
make	OO
a	OO
tattoo	OO
that	OO
conducts	OO
electricity	.O
so	OU
we've	OO
been	OO
working	OO
on	OO
a	OO
conducting	OO
tattoo	OO
ink	OO
in	OO
my	OO
lab	.O
and	OU
right	OO
now	,O
we're	OO
able	OO
to	OO
increase	OO
the	OO
conductivity	OO
of	OO
skin	OO
over	OO
300	OO
fold	OO
with	OO
our	OO
conducting	OO
tattoo	OO
ink	.O
now	,U
we	OO
have	OO
a	OO
long	OO
way	OO
to	OO
go	OO
before	OO
we	OO
reach	OO
the	OO
conductivity	OO
of	OO
something	OO
like	OO
a	OO
copper	OO
wire	,O
but	OO
we're	OO
making	OO
progress	OO
and	OO
i'm	OU
really	OO
excited	OO
about	OO
this	OO
because	OO
i	OU
think	OO
that	OO
it	OO
could	OO
open	OO
up	OO
a	OO
whole	OO
new	OO
world	OO
of	OO
possibility	OO
for	OO
tattoos	.O
i	OU
envision	OO
a	OO
future	OO
where	OO
tattoos	OO
enable	OO
us	OO
—	OO
tattooable	OO
wires	OO
and	OO
tattooable	OO
electronics	OO
enable	OO
us	OO
to	OO
merge	OO
our	OO
technologies	OO
with	OO
our	OO
bodies	OO
so	OO
that	OO
they	OO
feel	OO
more	OO
like	OO
extensions	OO
of	OO
ourselves	OO
rather	OO
than	OO
external	OO
devices	.O
so	OU
these	OO
are	OO
a	OO
few	OO
examples	OO
of	OO
the	OO
new	OO
abilities	OO
that	OO
we	OO
can	OO
gain	OO
by	OO
using	OO
nanotechnology	OO
to	OO
upgrade	OO
our	OO
tattoos	,O
but	OO
this	OO
really	OO
is	OO
only	OO
the	OO
beginning	.O
i	OU
believe	OO
the	OO
sky	OO
is	OO
the	OO
limit	OO
for	OO
what	OO
we	OO
can	OO
do	OO
with	OO
high	OO
tech	OO
tattoos	.O
in	OU
the	OO
future	,O
tattoos	OO
will	OO
not	OO
only	OO
be	OO
beautiful	,O
they'll	OO
be	OO
functional	OO
too	.O
thank	OU
you	.O

these	OU

very	OO
popular	,O
by	OO
the	OO

among	OO

an	OU
example	OO
of	OO
this	OO
is	OO
the	OO
juul	,U
which	OO
not	OO

but	OO
can	OO
also	OO
be	OO
plugged	OO
into	OO

many	OU

do	OO
not	OO
even	OO
think	OO
that	OO

e	OO

which	OO
has	OO
led	OO
to	OO
the	OO
use	OO
of	OO
terms	OO
like	OO
juuling	OO
instead	OO
of	OO
vaping	.O
many	OU
of	OO
these	OO
devices	OO
are	OO
so	OO
discreet	OO
and	OO
produce	OO
so	OO
little	OO
vapor	OO
that	OO
teens	OO
are	OO
using	OO
them	OO
in	OO

and	OO
hiding	OO
them	OO
in	OO
objects	OO
like	OO
sharpie	OU

their	OO

their	OO

now	,U
many	OO

think	OO
that	OO
these	OO

water	OO

and	OO
therefore	,O
they	OO
are	OO
safe	OO
to	OO

but	OU
this	OO
could	OO
not	OO
be	OO
further	OO
from	OO
the	OO
truth	.O
what	OU
is	OO
produced	OO
is	OO
not	OO
even	OO
a	OO
vapor	,O
it's	OO
an	OO
aerosol	,O
and	OO
let	OO
me	OO
tell	OO
you	,O
the	OO
difference	OO
is	OO
quite	OO
pronounced	.O
aerosols	OU
contain	OO
many	OO
finely	OO
suspended	OO
particles	OO
of	OO
liquids	OO
and	OO
gases	OO
that	OO
are	OO
created	OO
from	OO
whatever	OO
is	OO
in	OO
the	OO
e	OO
liquid	.O
so	OU
an	OO
aerosol	OO
could	OO
contain	OO
propylene	OO
glycol	OO
and	OO
glycerin	,O
which	OO
are	OO
solvents	OO
in	OO
the	OO
e	OO
liquid	.O
now	,U
these	OO
solvents	OO
are	OO
known	OO
to	OO
be	OO
safe	OO
for	OO
edible	OO
use	,O
so	OO
for	OO
use	OO
in	OO
products	OO
that	OO
you	OO
eat	,O
but	OO
we	OO
know	OO
very	OO
little	OO
about	OO
their	OO
safety	OO
following	OO
long	OO
term	OO
inhalational	OO
exposure	.O
the	OU
e	OO
liquids	OO
can	OO
also	OO
contain	OO
alcohol	,O
sometimes	OO
in	OO
high	OO
levels	,O
and	OO
inhaling	OO
alcohol	OO
is	OO
known	OO
to	OO
have	OO
toxic	OO
effects	OO
on	OO
the	OO
brain	.O
i	OU
told	OO
you	OO
earlier	OO
that	OO
the	OO
e	OO
liquids	OO
contain	OO
over	OO
15,000	OO
different	OO
flavors	.O
here	OU
are	OO
some	OO
examples	,O
some	OO
with	OO
very	OO
catchy	OO
but	OO
familiar	OO
names	OO
like	OO
skittles	OU
and	OO
fruit	OU
loops	,U
and	OO
others	OO
with	OO
more	OO
exotic	OO
names	OO
like	OO
dragon's	OU
milk	OU
and	OO
tiger's	OU
blood	OU
and	OO
unicorn	OU
puke	.U
the	OU
e	OO
liquid	OO
or	OO
the	OO
aerosol	OO
can	OO
also	OO
contain	OO
metallic	OO
particles	OO
like	OO
chromium	,O
cadmium	OO
and	OO
lead	.O
these	OU
are	OO
generated	OO
from	OO
the	OO

known	OO
to	OO

on	OO

so	OU
no	,O
let	OO
me	OO
make	OO
this	OO
very	OO
clear:	OO
what	OO

water	OO

exposure	OU
of	OO
the	OO

the	OU
teen	OO

very	OO
sensitive	OO
to	OO
even	OO

very	OO

in	OU

functioning	OO
of	OO
these	OO
systems	.O
so	OU
as	OO
an	OO
example	,O
chronic	OO
exposure	OO
to	OO
nicotine	OO
decreases	OO
the	OO
flexibility	OO
of	OO
the	OO
blood	OO
vessels	OO
and	OO
changes	OO
how	OO
the	OO
heart	OO
responds	OO
to	OO
acute	OO
challenges	OO
like	OO
stress	.O
the	OU
teen	OO
brain	OO
is	OO
not	OO
only	OO
sensitive	OO
to	OO
the	OO
addictive	OO
effects	OO
of	OO
nicotine	OO
but	OO
also	OO
to	OO
its	OO
toxic	OO
effects	.O
in	OU
adolescent	OO
animals	,O
nicotine	OO
is	OO
a	OO
very	OO
well	OO
established	OO
neurotoxin	,O
and	OO
it	OO
decreases	OO
learning	,O
memory	OO
and	OO
attention	OO
processes	OO
and	OO
increases	OO
hyperactivity	OO
symptoms	.O
teens	OU
who	OO
use	OO
tobacco	OO
products	OO
are	OO
more	OO
likely	OO
to	OO
use	OO
marijuana	OO
and	OO
alcohol	OO
and	OO
also	OO
develop	OO
depression	OO
and	OO
anxiety	OO
as	OO
a	OO
teen	OO
or	OO
as	OO
an	OO
adult	.O
so	OU
nicotine	OO
addiction	OO
through	OO
e	OO
cigarettes	OO
could	OO
be	OO
leading	OO
them	OO
down	OO
the	OO
path	OO
of	OO
other	OO
addictions	OO
and	OO
other	OO
mental	OO
health	OO
problems	.O
now	,U
in	OO
adolescent	OO
animals	,O
nicotine	OO
also	OO
produces	OO
epigenetic	OO
changes	,O
or	OO
heritable	OO
changes	OO
in	OO
gene	OO
expression	,O
for	OO
example	,O
in	OO
the	OO
genes	OO
involved	OO
in	OO
asthma	.O
so	OU
teens	OO
who	OO
use	OO
nicotine	OO
may	OO
not	OO
only	OO
be	OO
harming	OO
themselves	OO
but	OO
they	OO
could	OO
be	OO
harming	OO
their	OO
future	OO

you	OU
know	,O
the	OO
very	OO
existence	OO
of	OO

an	OO
entire	OO

of	OO

easy	OU
access	OO
to	OO
these	OO

by	OO

that	OO

what	OU
we	OO

that	OO

our	OU

we	OU

it	OO
a	OO

we	OU

that	OO

all	OO

are	OO
what	OO
we're	OO

so	OU
what	OO
exactly	OO
defines	OO
our	OO
modern	OO
understanding	OO
of	OO
cults	,O
and	OO
why	OO
do	OO
people	OO
join	OO
them	?O
broadly	OU
speaking	,O
a	OO

is	OO
a	OO
group	OO

some	OO

requires	OO
a	OO
high	OO
level	OO
of	OO

a	OO

to	OO

to	OO

when	OO

in	OO
the	OO

it	OU

all	OO
the	OO

many	OU

now	OU
look	OO

follow	OO
the	OO

the	OO

of	OO
the	OO

the	OU

it's	OU
below	OO
the	OO

that	OU

the	OO

behind	OO
the	OO
jump	.O
with	OU
the	OO
old	,O
pre	OO
fosbury	OU
techniques	,O
the	OO
jumper	OO
had	OO
to	OO
apply	OO
enough	OO

above	OO
the	OO

by	OO
a	OO
few	OO

to	OO
clear	OO
it	.O
the	OU
fosbury	OU
flopper	OU
doesn't	OO
have	OO
to	OO
do	OO
that	.O
the	OU
genius	OO
of	OO
the	OO
fosbury	OU
flop	OU
is	OO
that	OO
the	OO

can	OO
apply	OO
the	OO
same	OO
amount	OO
of	OO
force	,O
but	OO
raise	OO
his	OO

much	OO
higher	OO
than	OO
before	.O
that	OU
means	OO
he	OO
can	OO
raise	OO
the	OO

so	OO
high	OO
that	OO
even	OO
when	OO
his	OO

can't	OO
go	OO
any	OO
higher	,O
his	OO
arching	OO
body	OO
can	.O
fosbury's	OU
technique	OO
brought	OO
the	OO
high	OO
jump	OO
to	OO
new	OO
heights	OO
by	OO
splitting	OO
the	OO
jumper's	OO
body	OO
away	OO
from	OO

giving	OO
it	OO
that	OO
much	OO
more	OO

ok	.U
i	OU
want	OO
to	OO
ask	OO
you	OO
a	OO

they're	OO
going	OO

i	OU

this	OO
is	OO
amazing	,O
it's	OO
innovative	,O
it's	OO
creepy	,O
it's	OO
terrifying	.O
can	OU
you	OO
tell	OO
us	OO
what	OO
i	OU
think	.O
i	OU
think	OO
there	OO
are	OO
some	OO
uncomfortable	OO

around	OO
this	.O
tell	OU
us	,O
is	OO
this	OO
reading	OO
your	OO

will	OO
it	OO
in	OO
five	OO
years	,O
is	OO
there	OO
a	OO
weaponized	OO
version	OO
of	OO
this	,O
what	OO
does	OO
it	OO
look	OO
like	?O
ak:	OU
so	OU
our	OO
first	OO
design	OO
principle	,O
before	OO
we	OO
started	OO
working	OO
on	OO
this	,O
was	OO
to	OO
not	OO
render	OO
ethics	OO
as	OO
an	OO

so	OU
we	OO
wanted	OO
to	OO
bake	OO
ethics	OO
right	OO
into	OO
the	OO
design	.O
we	OU
flipped	OO
the	OO
design	.O
instead	OU
of	OO
reading	OO
from	OO
the	OO

directly	,O
we're	OO
reading	OO
from	OO
the	OO
voluntary	OO
nervous	OO

that	OO
you	OO
deliberately	OO
have	OO
to	OO
engage	OO
to	OO
communicate	OO
with	OO
the	OO

the	OU

ok	,U
i	OU

are	OO
going	OO
to	OO

a	OO

more	OO
questions	OO
for	OO
you	.O
also	,U
you	OO
said	OO
that	OO
it's	OO
a	OO

so	OU
right	OO
now	OO
it	OO
sits	OO
just	OO
right	OO
here	?O
is	OU
that	OO
the	OO
final	OO
iteration	,O
what	OO
the	OO
final	OO
design	OO
you	OO
hope	OO
looks	OO
like	?O
ak:	OU
our	OU
goal	OO
is	OO
for	OO
the	OO
technology	OO
to	OO
disappear	OO
completely	.O
sa:	OU
what	OU
does	OO
that	OO
mean	?O
ak:	OU
if	OU
you're	OO
wearing	OO
it	,O
i	OU
shouldn't	OO
be	OO
able	OO
to	OO
see	OO
it	.O
you	OU
don't	OO
want	OO
technology	OO
on	OO
your	OO

you	OO
want	OO
it	OO
in	OO
the	OO

to	OO

you	OO
in	OO

so	OU
we	OO

we're	OO
trying	OO
to	OO
make	OO

even	OO

version	OO
that	OO

right	OO
here	.O

about	OO

that	OO

what’s	OU
going	OO
on	OO
here	?O
there	OU
are	OO
actually	OO
two	OO
phenomena	OO
at	OO
play:	OO
the	OO
experience	OO
of	OO
pain	,O
and	OO
a	OO
biological	OO
process	OO
called	OO
nociception	.O
nociception	OU
is	OO
part	OO
of	OO
the	OO
nervous	OO

protective	OO
response	OO
to	OO

up	OO
the	OO

to	OO
the	OO

on	OO
to	OO
the	OO
brain	.O
the	OU
brain	OO
weighs	OO
the	OO
importance	OO
of	OO
these	OO
signals	OO
and	OO
produces	OO
pain	OO
if	OO
it	OO
decides	OO
the	OO

pain	OO
helps	OO
the	OO

but	OU
there	OO
are	OO
a	OO
whole	OO
set	OO
of	OO
factors	OO
besides	OO
nociception	OO
that	OO
can	OO
influence	OO
the	OO
experience	OO
of	OO
pain—	OO
and	OO
make	OO
pain	OO
less	OO
useful	.O
first	,U
there	OO
are	OO
biological	OO
factors	OO
that	OO

to	OO
the	OO

if	OU

are	OO
activated	OO
repeatedly	,O
the	OO

these	OU
forms	OO
of	OO

are	OO
most	OO

in	OO

chronic	OO
pain	,O
which	OO
is	OO
defined	OO
as	OO
pain	OO
lasting	OO
more	OO

3	OO

when	OU

psychological	OU
factors	OO

a	OO

the	OO

it	OU
may	OO

something	OO
that	OO

we	OU

to	OO

we	OU

what	OO

by	OO

the	OO

that's	OU
why	OO
it	OO

that	OO

where	OO

let's	OO
biomimic	OO
meat	OO
with	OO

let's	OO
make	OO
plant	OO

meat	.O
idea	OU
number	OO
two:	OO
for	OO
actual	OO
animal	OO
meat	,O
let's	OO
grow	OO
it	OO
directly	OO
from	OO
cells	.O
instead	OU
of	OO
growing	OO
live	OO
animals	,O
let's	OO
grow	OO
the	OO
cells	OO
directly	.O
it	OU
takes	OO
six	OO
weeks	OO
to	OO
grow	OO
a	OO
chicken	OO
to	OO

grow	OU
the	OO
cells	OO
directly	,O
you	OO
can	OO
get	OO
that	OO
same	OO
growth	OO
in	OO
six	OO
days	.O
this	OU
is	OO
what	OO
that	OO
looks	OO
like	OO
at	OO
scale	.O
it's	OU
your	OO
friendly	OO
neighborhood	OO
meat	OO
brewery	.O
i	OU
want	OO
to	OO
make	OO
two	OO
points	OO
about	OO
this	.O
the	OU
first	OO
one	OO
is	,O
we	OO
believe	OO
we	OO
can	OO
do	OO
it	.O
in	OU
recent	OO
years	,O
some	OO
companies	OO
have	OO
been	OO
producing	OO
meat	OO
from	OO
plants	OO
that	OO
consumers	OO
cannot	OO
distinguish	OO
from	OO
actual	OO
animal	OO
meat	,O
and	OO
there	OO
are	OO
now	OO
dozens	OO
of	OO
companies	OO
growing	OO
actual	OO
animal	OO
meat	OO
directly	OO
from	OO
cells	.O
this	OU
plant	OO
based	OO
and	OO
cell	OO
based	OO
meat	OO
gives	OO
consumers	OO
everything	OO
that	OO
they	OO
love	OO
about	OO
meat	OO
—	OO
the	OO
taste	,O
the	OO
texture	OO
and	OO
so	OO
on	OO
—	OO
but	OO
with	OO
no	OO
need	OO
for	OO
antibiotics	OO
and	OO
with	OO
a	OO
fraction	OO
of	OO
the	OO
adverse	OO
impact	OO
on	OO
the	OO
climate	.O
and	OU
because	OO
these	OO
two	OO
technologies	OO
are	OO
so	OO
much	OO
more	OO
efficient	,O
at	OO
production	OO
scale	OO
these	OO
products	OO
will	OO
be	OO
cheaper	.O
but	OU
one	OO
quick	OO
point	OO
about	OO
that	OO
—	OO
it's	OO
not	OO
going	OO
to	OO
be	OO
easy	.O
these	OU
plant	OO
based	OO
companies	OO
have	OO
spent	OO
small	OO
fortunes	OO
on	OO
their	OO
burgers	,O
and	OO

not	OO
yet	OO

what's	OO
not	OO
to	OO

about	OO
an	OO

that's	OO

and	OU
the	OO
need	OO
to	OO

audience:	OU
awww	.U
but	OU
sloths	OO
are	OO
massively	OO
misunderstood	.O
they've	OU
been	OO
saddled	OO
with	OO
a	OO
name	OO
that	OO
speaks	OO
of	OO
sin	OO
and	OO
damned	OO
for	OO
their	OO

which	OO

the	OO

for	OO

well	,U
i'm	OU
here	OO
to	OO
tell	OO
you	OO
that	OO
we've	OO
got	OO
this	OO
animal	OO
all	OO
wrong	OO
—	OO
and	OO
how	OO
understanding	OO
the	OO

about	OO
the	OO

may	OO
help	OO

us	OO
and	OO
this	OO

we	OO
both	OO

i	OU
traced	OO

slander	OO
back	OO
to	OO
a	OO
spanish	OU
conquistador	OO
called	OO
valdés	,U
who	OO
gave	OO
the	OO
first	OO
description	OO
of	OO
a	OO
sloth	OO
in	OO
his	OO
encyclopedia	OO
of	OO
the	OO
new	OU
world	.U
he	OU
said	OO
the	OO
sloth	OO
was	OO
the	OO
stupidest	OO
animal	OO
that	OO
can	OO
be	OO
found	OO
in	OO
the	OO
world	.O
i	OU
have	OO
never	OO
seen	OO
such	OO
an	OO
ugly	OO
animal	OO
or	OO
one	OO
that	OO
is	OO
more	OO
useless	.O
tell	OU
us	OO
what	OO
you	OO
really	OO
think	,O
valdés	.U
i'd	OU
like	OO
to	OO
have	OO
a	OO
word	OO
about	OO
valdés's	OU
drawing	OO
skills	.O
i	OU
mean	,O
what	OO
is	OO
that	?O
i've	OU
never	OO
seen	OO
an	OO
illustration	OO
of	OO
a	OO
sloth	OO
that's	OO
more	OO
useless	.O
but	OU
i	OU
mean	,O
on	OO
the	OO
plus	OO
side	,O
he	OO
has	OO
given	OO
the	OO
sloth	OO
a	OO
remarkably	OO
humanlike	OO
face	,O
and	OO
sloths	OO
do	OO
have	OO
remarkably	OO
humanlike	OO
faces	.O
this	OU
sloth	OO
i	OU
photographed	OO
in	OO
costa	OU
rica	,U
i	OU
think	OO
looks	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
like	OO
ringo	OU
starr	.U
but	OU
then	,O
sloths	OO
do	OO
bear	OO
an	OO
uncanny	OO
resemblance	OO
to	OO
the	OO
the	OU
beatles	.U
particularly	OU
pleased	OO
with	OO
paul	,U
actually	,O
on	OO
there	.O
but	OU
like	OO
the	OU
beatles	,U
sloths	OO
are	OO
also	OO
extremely	OO
successful	.O
they	OU
come	OO
from	OO
an	OO
ancient	OO
line	OO
of	OO
mammals	,O
and	OO
there	OO
were	OO
once	OO
dozens	OO
of	OO
species	OO
including	OO
the	OO
giant	OO
ground	OO
sloth	,O
which	OO
was	OO
the	OO
size	OO
of	OO
a	OO
small	OO
elephant	OO
and	OO
one	OO
of	OO
the	OO
only	OO
animals	OO
big	OO
enough	OO
to	OO
eat	OO
avocado	OO

whole	OO
and	OO
disperse	OO
them	.O
so	.U
some	OU
of	OO
you	OO
have	OO
worked	OO
it	OO
out	OO
already	.O
that	OU
means	OO
that	OO
without	OO
sloths	,O
there	OO
might	OO
be	OO
no	OO
avocado	OO
on	OO

today	,O
leaving	OO

everywhere	OO
totally	OO

at	OO

today	,U
there	OO
are	OO
six	OO
surviving	OO
species	,O
and	OO
they	OO
fall	OO
into	OO
two	OO
groups	.O
you've	OU
got	OO
your	OO
bradypus	OU
three	OO
toed	OO
sloths	,O
they're	OO
the	OO
ones	OO
with	OO
the	OO
beatles	OU

and	OO
the	OO
mona	OU
lisa	OU
smiles	.O
then	,U
there	OO
are	OO
the	OO
two	OO
toed	OO
sloths	.O
they	OU
look	OO
a	OO
little	OO
bit	OO
more	OO
like	OO
a	OO
cross	OO
between	OO
a	OO
wookiee	OU
and	OO
a	OO
pig	.O
they	OU
live	OO
in	OO
the	OO
jungles	OO
of	OO
central	OU
and	OO
south	OU
america	,U
and	OO
they're	OO
extremely	OO
prolific	.O
there	OU
was	OO
a	OO
survey	OO
that	OO
was	OO
done	OO
in	OO
the	OO
1970s	OO
in	OO
a	OO
panamanian	OU
tropical	OO
forest	OO
that	OO
found	OO
that	OO
sloths	OO
were	OO
the	OO
most	OO
numerically	OO
abundant	OO
large	OO
animal	.O
they	OU
took	OO
up	OO
one	OO
quarter	OO
of	OO
the	OO
mammalian	OO
biomass	.O
now	,U
that's	OO
an	OO
awful	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
sloths	OO
and	OO
suggests	OO
they're	OO
doing	OO
something	OO
very	OO
right	OO
indeed	.O
so	OU
what	OO
if	,O
rather	OO
than	OO
deriding	OO
the	OO
sloth	OO
for	OO
being	OO
different	,O
we	OO
tried	OO
to	OO
learn	OO
from	OO
it	OO
instead	?O
we	OU
humans	OO
are	OO
obsessed	OO
with	OO
speed	.O
busyness	OU
is	OO
a	OO
badge	OO
of	OO
honor	,O
and	OO
convenience	OO
trumps	OO
quality	OO
in	OO
our	OO
quest	OO
for	OO
quick	.O
our	OU
addiction	OO
to	OO
the	OO
express	OO
life	OO
is	OO
choking	OO
us	OO
and	OO
the	OO
planet	.O
we	OU
idolize	OO
animals	OO
like	OO
the	OO
cheetah	,O
the	OO
ferrari	OU
of	OO
the	OO
animal	OO
kingdom	,O
capable	OO
of	OO
doing	OO
naught	OO
to	OO
60	OO
in	OO
three	OO
seconds	OO
flat	.O
well	,U
so	OO
what	?O
so	OU
what	?O
the	OU
sloth	,O
on	OO
the	OO
other	OO
hand	,O
can	OO
reach	OO
a	OO
leisurely	OO
17	OO
feet	OO
a	OO
minute	OO
with	OO
the	OO
wind	OO
behind	OO
it	.O
but	OU
being	OO
fast	OO
is	OO
costly	.O
the	OU
cheetah	OO
is	OO
speedy	,O
but	OO
at	OO
the	OO
expense	OO
of	OO
strength	.O
they	OU
can't	OO
risk	OO
getting	OO
in	OO
a	OO
fight	,O
so	OO
they	OO
lose	OO
one	OO
in	OO
nine	OO
kills	OO
to	OO
tougher	OO
predators	OO
like	OO
hyenas	.O
no	OU
wonder	OO
they're	OO
laughing	.O
the	OU
sloth	,O
on	OO
the	OO
other	OO
hand	,O
has	OO
taken	OO
a	OO
more	OO
stealthy	OO
approach	OO
to	OO
dinner	.O
they	OU
survive	OO
by	OO
capturing	OO
and	OO
consuming	OO
static	OO
leaves	.O
but	OU
you	OO
see	,O
leaves	OO
don't	OO
want	OO
to	OO
be	OO
eaten	OO
any	OO
more	OO
than	OO
antelope	OO
do	,O
so	OO
they're	OO
loaded	OO
full	OO
of	OO
toxins	OO
and	OO
very	OO
hard	OO
to	OO
digest	.O
so	OU
in	OO
order	OO
to	OO
consume	OO
them	,O
the	OO
sloth	OO
has	OO
also	OO
had	OO
to	OO
become	OO
an	OO
athlete	OO
—	OO
a	OO
digesting	OO
athlete	.O
the	OU
sloth's	OO
secret	OO
weapon	OO
is	OO
a	OO
four	OO
chambered	OO
stomach	OO
and	OO
plenty	OO
of	OO
time	.O
they	OU
have	OO
the	OO
slowest	OO
digestion	OO
rate	OO
of	OO
any	OO
mammal	.O
and	OU
it	OO
can	OO
take	OO
up	OO
to	OO
a	OO
month	OO
to	OO
process	OO
a	OO
single	OO
leaf	,O
which	OO
gives	OO
their	OO
liver	OO
plenty	OO
of	OO
time	OO
to	OO
process	OO
those	OO
toxins	.O
so	,U
sloths	OO
aren't	OO
lazy	.O
no	,U
they're	OO
busy	.O
digesting	.U
yeah	,U
really	OO
busy	.O
hard	OU
at	OO
work	,O
that	OO
sloth	,O
very	OO
hard	OO
at	OO
work	.O
and	OU
of	OO
course	,O
leaves	OO
have	OO
little	OO
calorific	OO
value	,O
so	OO
sloths	OO
have	OO
evolved	OO
to	OO
spend	OO
as	OO
little	OO
energy	OO
as	OO
possible	.O
they	OU
do	OO
about	OO
10	OO
percent	OO
of	OO
the	OO
work	OO
of	OO
a	OO
similar	OO
sized	OO
mammal	OO
and	OO
survive	OO
on	OO
as	OO
little	OO
as	OO
100	OO
calories	OO
a	OO
day	,O
thanks	OO
to	OO
some	OO
ingenious	OO
adaptations	.O
the	OU
bradypus	,U
three	OO
toed	OO
sloths	,O
they've	OO
got	OO
more	OO
neck	OO
bones	OO
than	OO
any	OO
other	OO
mammal	,O
even	OO
a	OO
giraffe	.O
which	OU
means	OO
they	OO
can	OO
turn	OO
their	OO
head	OO
through	OO
270	OO
degrees	OO
and	OO
graze	OO
all	OO
around	OO
them	,O
without	OO
having	OO
to	OO
actually	OO
bother	OO
with	OO
the	OO
effort	OO
of	OO
moving	OO
their	OO
body	.O
it	OU
also	OO
means	OO
that	OO
they	OO
are	OO
surprisingly	OO
good	OO
swimmers	.O
sloths	OU
can	OO
bob	OO
along	OO
in	OO
water	OO
three	OO
times	OO
faster	OO
than	OO
they	OO
can	OO
move	OO
on	OO
land	,O
kept	OO
afloat	OO
by	.O
trapped	OO
wind	.O
so	OU
—	OO
sloths	OO
are	OO
the	OO
only	OO
mammal	OO
that	OO
we	OO
know	OO
of	OO
that	OO
don't	OO
do	OO
flatulence	.O
when	OU
they	OO
need	OO
to	OO
expel	OO
gas	,O
it's	OO
actually	OO
reabsorbed	OO
into	OO
their	OO
bloodstream	OO
and	OO
expelled	OO
orally	OO
as	OO
a	OO
sort	OO
of	OO
mouth	OO
fart	.O
turning	OU
their	OO
lives	OO
upside	OO
down	OO
saves	OO
further	OO
energy	.O
they	OU
have	OO
about	OO
half	OO
the	OO
skeletal	OO
muscle	OO
of	OO
a	OO
terrestrial	OO
mammal	.O
they	OU
don't	OO
really	OO
have	OO
so	OO
many	OO
of	OO
the	OO
extensor	OO
muscles	OO
that	OO
are	OO
the	OO
weight	OO
bearing	OO
muscles;	OO
instead	,O
they	OO
rely	OO
on	OO
retractor	OO
muscles	OO
to	OO
pull	OO
themselves	OO
along	.O
they	OU
have	OO
long	,O
hooked	OO
claws	OO
and	OO
a	OO
high	OO
fatigue	OO
resistance	,O
so	OO
they	OO
can	OO
literally	OO
hook	OO
on	OO
and	OO
hang	OO
like	OO
a	OO
happy	,O
hairy	OO
hammock	OO
for	OO
hours	OO
on	OO
end	.O
and	OU
sloths	OO
can	OO
do	OO
almost	OO
anything	OO
in	OO
this	OO
inverted	OO
position	.O
they	OU
sleep	,O
eat	OO
and	OO
even	OO
give	OO
birth	.O
their	OU
throat	OO
and	OO
blood	OO
vessels	OO
are	OO
uniquely	OO
adapted	OO
to	OO
pump	OO
blood	OO
and	OO
to	OO
swallow	OO
food	OO
against	OO
the	OO
force	OO
of	OO
gravity	.O
they	OU
have	OO
sticky	OO
bits	OO
on	OO
their	OO
ribs	OO
that	OO
prevent	OO
their	OO
enormous	OO
stomach	OO
from	OO
crushing	OO
their	OO
lungs	.O
and	OU
their	OO
fur	OO
grows	OO
the	OO
opposite	OO
direction	,O
so	OO
they	OO
can	OO
drip	OO
dry	OO
after	OO
a	OO
tropical	OO
drenching	.O
the	OU
only	OO
problem	OO
is	,O
if	OO
you	OO
turn	OO
a	OO
sloth	OO
the	OO
other	OO
way	OO
up	,O
gravity	OO
removes	OO
its	OO
dignity	.O
audience:	OU
awww	.U
they	OU
can't	OO
hold	OO
themselves	OO
upright	.O
and	OU
so	OO
they	OO
drag	OO
their	OO
bodies	OO
along	OO
as	OO
if	OO
mountaineering	OO
on	OO
a	OO
flat	OO
surface	.O
and	OU
i	OU
think	OO
this	OO
is	OO
why	OO
the	OO
early	OO
explorers	OO
like	OO
valdés	OU
thought	OO
so	OO
poorly	OO
of	OO
them	,O
because	OO
they	OO

out	OO
of	OO

i've	OU
spent	OO
many	OO
happy	OO
hours	OO
mesmerized	OO
by	OO
moving	OO
sloths	.O
their	OU

of	OO

this	OU

which	OO
is	OO
not	OO

you're	OO

wondering:	OO
how	OU
does	OO
a	OO

of	OO

avoid	OO

good	OU
question	.O
well	,U
this	OO
is	OO
one	OO
of	OO
the	OO
sloth's	OO
main	OO
predators	.O
it's	OU
the	OO
harpy	OO
eagle	.O
it	OU
can	OO
fly	OO
at	OO
speeds	OO
of	OO
up	OO
to	OO
50	OO
miles	OO
per	OO
hour	,O
has	OO

the	OO
size	OO
of	OO
a	OO

that	OO

so	OO
that	OO
it	OO
can	OO
hear	OO
the	OO

the	OU
sloth	,O
on	OO
the	OO
other	OO
hand	,O
has	OO
poor	OO
hearing	,O
bad	OO
eyesight	,O
and	OO
running	OO
from	OO
danger	OO
is	OO
clearly	OO
not	OO
an	OO
option	.O
no	,U
they	OO
survive	OO
by	OO
wearing	OO
an	OO
invisibility	OO
cloak	OO
worthy	OO
of	OO
harry	OU

their	OU
fur	OO

that	OO

for	OO
when	OO

this	OU

with	OO
this	OO
hypothetical	OO
scenario:	OO
a	OO
study	OO
using	OO

a	OO

the	OU

the	OO

the	OO

those	OO
that	OO

the	OO

are	OO
not	.O
can	OU
you	OO
spot	OO
the	OO
problem	OO
with	OO
this	OO
headline:	OO
study	OU
shows	OO
new	OO
drug	OO
could	OO
cure	OO
cancer	OO
since	OU
the	OO

of	OO
the	OO

we	OO

about	OO

this	OO

early	OO
research	OO
on	OO

up	OO
in	OO

now	OU
that	OO
you’ve	OO

up	,O
let’s	OO
try	OO
a	OO
trickier	OO
example:	OO
a	OO
study	OO
about	OO
the	OO
impact	OO
of	OO
aspirin	OO
on	OO
heart	OO

the	OU

the	OU
members	OO
of	OO
one	OO
group	OO
take	OO

daily	,O
while	OO
the	OO

a	OO
daily	OO
placebo	.O
by	OU
the	OO
end	OO
of	OO
the	OO
trial	,O
the	OO

group	OO
suffered	OO
significantly	OO
more	OO
heart	OO
attacks	OO
than	OO
the	OO
group	OO
that	OO
took	OO
aspirin	.O
based	OU
on	OO
this	OO
situation	,O
what’s	OO
wrong	OO
with	OO
the	OO
headline:	OO
aspirin	OU
may	OO
reduce	OO
risk	OO
of	OO
heart	OO
attacks	OO
in	OU
this	OO
case	,O
the	OO
study	OO
shows	OO
evidence	OO
that	OO
aspirin	OO
reduces	OO
heart	OO
attacks	OO
in	OO
men	,O
because	OO
all	OO
the	OO
participants	OO
were	OO
men	.O
but	OU
the	OO
conclusion	OO
“aspirin	OO
reduces	OO
risk	OO
of	OO

attacks”	OO
is	OO
too	OO
broad;	OO
we	OO
can’t	OO
assume	OO
that	OO

in	OO
men	OO
would	OO
also	OO
apply	OO
to	OO
women	.O
studies	OU
often	OO
limit	OO

on	OO
geographic	OO

age	,O

or	OO
many	OO
other	OO
factors	.O
before	OU
these	OO

be	OO
generalized	,O
similar	OO
studies	OO

to	OO

run	OO
on	OO
other	OO

if	OU
a	OO

makes	OO
a	OO
general	OO

it	OO
should	OO
draw	OO
its	OO
evidence	OO
from	OO
a	OO
diverse	OO
body	OO
of	OO

not	OO
one	OO

can	OU
you	OO
take	OO
your	OO
skills	OO
from	OO
the	OO
first	OO
two	OO
questions	OO
to	OO
the	OO
next	OO
level	?O
try	OU
this	OO
example	OO
about	OO
the	OO
impact	OO
of	OO

breakfast	OO
on	OO
weight	OO
loss	.O
researchers	OU
recruit	OO
a	OO
group	OO
of	OO

who	OO
had	OO
always	OO
skipped	OO
breakfast	OO
and	OO
ask	OO
them	OO
to	OO

the	OU

over	OU
a	OO

what’s	OO

the	OU

but	OO
we	OO
don’t	OO

that	OO

because	OO
they	OO
started	OO

perhaps	OO

their	OO
weight	OO
tracked	OO
inspired	OO
them	OO
to	OO

their	OO

to	OU
rule	OO
out	OO
the	OO

a	OU

the	OU

that	OO

some	OO

believe	OO
that	OO

what's	OO
driving	OO
the	OO

of	OO
someone	OO

i'm	OU
betting	OO
you	OO

point	OO
to	OO
an	OO
element	OO
of	OO

in	OO
that	OO

time	OO
you	OO

in	OO
intense	OO

and	OO
how	OO
desperate	OO
you	OO
were	OO
to	OO
stop	OO
it	.O
what	OU
if	OO
you	OO
had	OO
been	OO
offered	OO
an	OO

to	OO
feeling	OO

imagine	OU
for	OO
a	OO
moment	OO
breaking	OO
your	OO

in	OO
an	OO
avalanche	.O
now	OU
that	OO
injury	OO
alone	OO
can	OO
be	OO
a	OO
fairly	OO
traumatic	OO
experience	,O
but	OO
it's	OO
manageable	.O
with	OU
short	OO

pain	OO
management	,O
most	OO
would	OO
make	OO
a	OO
full	OO

but	OU
now	OO

that	OO

only	OO
this	OO

your	OO

it	OO
out	OO

it	OU
seems	OO

there's	OO

toxic	,O
it's	OO

our	OU

it's	OU
the	OO

everyone	OU

it's	OO

and	OU
i	OU

a	OO

summary	OO
for	OO
how	OO
we	OO

here	.O
we	OU
built	OO
a	OO
society	OO
that	OO

filled	OO
with	OO

we	OU
combined	OO
that	OO
with	OO
a	OO

system	OO
that's	OO
intended	OO
to	OO
primarily	OO
treat	OO
physiological	OO

and	OO
then	OO
we	OO
put	OO
big	OU

in	OO
the	OO

directly	OO
at	OO

with	OO

that	OO

to	OO

and	OU
now	OO
we're	OO
in	OO
the	OO

of	OO
what	OO
the	OO
former	OO

called	OO
the	OO

the	OO
nation	OO
has	OO

what	OO

then	OO
the	OO

now	OO

the	OO

that	OO

this	OU

to	OO
me	.O
there	OU

people	OO
in	OO
our	OO

today	OO
who	OO
will	OO
still	OO

they're	OU

every	OO

the	OO

before	OO
we	OO

something	OO
about	OO
it	.O

by	OO
then	,O
it's	OO
often	OO
too	OO
late	.O
we	OU
have	OO
to	OO

sooner	.O
we	OU
have	OO
to	OO
practice	OO
early	OO

we	OU
have	OO
to	OO

we	OU

to	OO

that	OO

in	OO
thirty	OO

and	OO
then	OO
we	OO
have	OO
to	OO
improve	OO

we	OU
have	OO
to	OO
eliminate	OO
the	OO

and	OO
most	OO

we	OO
have	OO
to	OO
reform	OO
a	OO

that	OO

slowly	OO
coming	OO
to	OO

with	OO
the	OO
fact	OO
that	OO
they	OO

responsible	OO
for	OO
this	OO

it	OU
took	OO
me	OO
over	OO
a	OO
decade	OO
of	OO
active	OO
addiction	OO
and	OO
many	OO
more	OO
in	OO
recovery	OO
before	OO
i	OU
finally	OO
learned	OO
the	OO
difference	OO
between	OO
feeling	OO
better	OO
and	OO
actually	OO
being	OO
better	.O
because	OU
i	OU
had	OO
to	OO
learn	OO
to	OO
lean	OO
into	OO
the	OO
pain	.O
i	OU
had	OO
to	OO
quit	OO
looking	OO
for	OO
the	OO
fast	OO
road	OO
to	OO
relief	.O
i	OU
had	OO
to	OO
do	OO
the	OO
emotional	OO
work	OO
that	OO
needed	OO
to	OO
be	OO
done	OO
no	OO
matter	OO
how	OO

it	OO

and	OU
after	OO
multiple	OO
attempts	OO
at	OO
short	OO

treatment	,O
i	OU
finally	OO
found	OO
a	OO
willingness	OO
to	OO
do	OO
whatever	OO
it	OO
took	,O
and	OO
i	OU
stayed	OO
in	OO
a	OO
continuum	OO
of	OO
care	OO
for	OO
14	OO
consecutive	OO
months	OO
in	OO
order	OO
to	OO
figure	OO
it	OO
out	.O
i	OU
had	OO
to	OO
go	OO
through	OO
the	OO
stages	OO
of	OO
grief	OO
that	OO
i	OU
should've	OO
been	OO
going	OO
through	OO
at	OO
age	OO
17	,O
at	OO
age	OO
29	.O
but	OU
i	OU
refused	OO
to	OO
keep	OO
running	,O
and	OO
it	OO
worked	.O
fortunately	OU
for	OO
us	,O
there	OO
is	OO
such	OO
a	OO
thing	OO
as	OO
post	OO
traumatic	OO
growth	,O
and	OO
you're	OO
witnessing	OO
that	OO
on	OO
the	OO
stage	OO
before	OO
you	OO
today	.O
post	OU
traumatic	OO
growth	OO
is	OO
defined	OO
as	OO
the	OO
positive	OO
psychological	OO
change	OO
that	OO
can	OO
occur	OO
in	OO
a	OO
person	OO
after	OO
they've	OO
experienced	OO
a	OO
traumatic	OO
life	OO
event	.O
it	OU
implies	OO
that	OO
by	OO
finding	OO
a	OO
way	OO
to	OO
endure	OO
through	OO
significant	OO
suffering	,O
you	OO
can	OO
actually	OO
have	OO
meaningful	OO
development	OO
of	OO
personal	OO
character	OO
and	OO
elevate	OO
yourself	OO
to	OO
a	OO
higher	OO
level	OO
of	OO
functioning	.O
but	OU
achieving	OO
post	OO
traumatic	OO
growth	OO
requires	OO
that	OO
you	OO
lean	OO
into	OO
the	OO
pain	.O
you	OU
can't	OO
run	OO
from	OO
it	.O
you	OU
can't	OO
medicate	OO
it	.O
so	OU
now	OO
i	OU
have	OO
a	OO
challenge	OO
for	OO
you	.O
take	OU
an	OO
audit	OO
of	OO
your	OO
current	OO
level	OO
of	OO
emotional	OO
pain	.O
do	OU
you	OO
have	OO
grief	OO
or	OO
heartache	OO
that	OO
you	OO
aren't	OO
dealing	OO
with	?O
has	OU
something	OO
traumatic	OO
happened	OO
to	OO
you	OO
that	OO
you	OO
haven't	OO
healed	OO
from	?O
if	OU
so	,O
take	OO
a	OO
step	OO
towards	OO
addressing	OO
this	OO
pain	.O
call	OU
a	OO
friend	,O
talk	OO
to	OO
a	OO
therapist	,O
just	OO
speak	OO
your	OO
truth	OO
to	OO
a	OO
stranger	.O
take	OU
one	OO
small	OO
step	OO
to	OO
shed	OO
light	OO
on	OO
this	OO
darkness	OO
because	OO
i've	OU
seen	OO
what	OO
darkness	OO
can	OO
do	.O
i've	OU
seen	OO
it	OO
in	OO
hospital	OO
rooms	OO
when	OO
just	OO
one	OO
more	OO
didn't	OO
end	OO
up	OO
the	OO
way	OO
it	OO
was	OO
intended	.O
i've	OU
seen	OO
it	OO
in	OO
jails	OO
with	OO
people	OO
who	OO
were	OO
born	OO
addicted	OO
and	OO
never	OO
had	OO
a	OO
chance	OO
to	OO
learn	OO
anything	OO
else	.O
i've	OU
seen	OO
it	OO
at	OO
funerals	OO
for	OO
children	OO
who	OO
died	OO
before	OO
they	OO
ever	OO
had	OO
a	OO
chance	OO
to	OO
truly	OO
live	.O
and	OU
i've	OU
seen	OO
it	OO
from	OO
underneath	OO
a	OO
table	OO
in	OO
the	OO
library	OO
of	OO
my	OO
high	OO
school	.O
i	OU
want	OO
to	OO
leave	OO
you	OO
all	OO
with	OO
something	OO
that	OO
i	OU
wish	OO
i	OU
had	OO
known	OO
at	OO

whoever	OU
you	OO
are	,O
whatever	OO
you're	OO
going	OO
through	,O
in	OO
whatever	OO
way	OO
you	OO
might	OO
be	OO
going	OO
through	OO
it	,O
just	OO
know	OO
this:	OO
in	OO
order	OO
to	OO
heal	OO
it	,O
you	OO
have	OO
to	OO
feel	OO
it	.O
we're	OU
not	OO
going	OO
to	OO
solve	OO
the	OO
addiction	OO
pandemic	OO
overnight	OO
but	OO
we	OO
will	OO
make	OO

when	OO
people	OO
start	OO
to	OO
understand	OO
the	OO
difference	OO
between	OO
physical	OO
and	OO
emotional	OO
pain	,O
and	OO
then	OO
choose	OO
to	OO
do	OO
something	OO
about	OO
it	.O
in	OU
recovery	,O
we	OO
often	OO
say	,O
you	OO
keep	OO
what	OO
you	OO
have	OO
by	OO
giving	OO
it	OO
away	.O
find	OU
the	OO
courage	OO
to	OO

the	OO

and	OO
you	OO
can	OO
be	OO
a	OO

in	OO

you	.O
in	OU
the	OO
1920's	,O
the	OO

you	OO
to	OO

i	OU
wanted	OO
to	OO

off	OO
by	OO

question	OO
to	OO
everyone	OO
in	OO
the	OO

and	OO
you	OO
can	OO
take	OO
a	OO

to	OO
think	OO
about	OO
this	OO
question	.O
i	OU
wanted	OO
to	OO
ask	OO
what	OO
do	OO
you	OO
find	OO
most	OO
beautiful	?O
and	OU
not	OO
in	OO
the	OO
world	,O
like	OO
butterflies	OO
and	OO

but	OO
in	OO
a	OO
person	.O
what	OU
do	OO
you	OO
find	OO
the	OO
most	OO
attractive	OO
in	OO
a	OO
person	?O
is	OU
it	OO

you	OO

curly	OU

big	OU

some	OU
people	OO

big	OO
feet	.O
what	OU
is	OO
it	OO
about	OO
people	OO
that	OO
we	OO
find	OO
attractive	?O
i	OU
think	OO
that	OO
the	OO
way	OO
that	OO
we	OO
think	OO
of	OO
beauty	OO
comes	OO
from	OO
different	OO
things	OO
like:	OO
social	OO
media	,O
the	OO
internet	,U
magazines	,O
especially	,O
if	OO
that's	OO
coming	OO
from	OO
a	OO
model	.O
i	OU
feel	OO
like	OO
those	OO
are	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
what	OO
define	OO
beauty	OO
today	.O
and	OU
personally	OO
to	OO
me	,O
i	OU
feel	OO
that	OO
beauty	OO
is	OO
in	OO
everything	.O
some	OU
people	OO
may	OO
say	OO
that	OO
big	OO
feet	OO
are	OO
not	OO
cute	,O
but	OO
there's	OO
going	OO
to	OO
be	OO
a	OO
pair	OO
of	OO
shoes	OO
that	OO
will	OO
look	OO
better	OO
on	OO
my	OO
size	OO
9	OO
feet	OO
than	OO
a	OO
size	OO
6	OO
foot	.O
so	,U
i	OU
find	OO
that	OO
there	OO
could	OO
be	OO
beauty	OO
in	OO
everything	.O
for	OU
example	,O
i	OU
love	OO
your	OO
dreads	.O
they	OU
are	OO
amazing	.O
your	OU
gorgeous	OO
hair	,O
talia	.U
oh	,U
my	OO
god	.O
i	OU
wish	OO
i	OU
could	OO
get	OO
mine	OO
to	OO
be	OO
that	OO
big	.O
sir	,U
with	OO
the	OO
shiny	OO
bold	OO
head	,O
i	OU
think	OO
that	OO
this	OO
is	OO
amazing	.O
that	OU
sheen	,O
perfect	.O
as	OU
you	OO
can	OO
see	,O
i	OU
find	OO
beauty	OO
in	OO
everything	.O
and	,U
of	OO
course:	OO
i	OU
find	OO
beauty	OO
in	OO
everything	OO
is	OO
super	OO
duper	OO
cliche	.O
like	OU
beauty	OO
in	OO
everything	.O
i	OU
don't	OO
think	OO
everyone	OO
thinks	OO
that	OO
there	OO
is	OO
beauty	OO
in	OO
everything	,O
but	OO
the	OO
reason	OO
why	OO
i	OU
feel	OO
that	OO
there	OO
is	OO
beauty	OO
in	OO
everything	OO
is	OO
because	OO
when	OO
i	OU
was	OO
young	,O
i	OU
was	OO
picked	OO
on	OO
for	OO
something	OO
that	OO
today	OO
i	OU
feel	OO
is	OO
amazing	.O
one	OU
thing	OO
about	OO
me	OO
connects	OO
millions	OO
of	OO
people	OO
around	OO
the	OO
world	.O
and	OU
that	OO
is	OO
something	OO
i	OU
think	OO
you	OO
can	OO
probably	OO
see	,O
it's	OO
my	OO
skin	OO
condition	,O
it's	OO
called	OO
vitiligo	.O
and	OU
vitiligo	OO
is	OO
basically	OO
my	OO
immune	OO
system	OO
that	OO
feels	OO
that	OO
my	OO
melanin	OO
which	OO
is	OO
what	OO
makes	OO
color	OO
in	OO
your	OO
skin	,O
thinks	OO
that	OO
my	OO
melanin	OO
is	OO
a	OO
disease	,O
something	OO
similar	OO
to	OO
the	OO
common	OO
cold	,O
so	OO
it	OO
fights	OO
it	OO
off	,O
and	OO
that	OO
makes	OO
my	OO
skin	OO
turn	OO
white	.O
i	OU
was	OO
singled	OO
out	OO
because	OO
of	OO
this	OO
skin	OO
condition	.O
i	OU
was	OO
bullied	.O
i	OU
was	OO
alienated	.O
even	OU
by	OO
people	OO
who	OO
didn't	OO
mean	OO
to	OO
alienate	OO
me	.O
for	OU
example:	OO
we	OO
would	,O
like	OO
everyone	OO
does	,O
take	OO
family	OO
pictures	,O
and	OO
my	OO
mom	OO
would	OO
bring	OO
a	OO
little	OO
top	OO
of	OO
makeup	,O
and	OO
it	OO
was	OO
her	OO
makeup	.O
my	OU
mom	OO
is	OO
not	OO
the	OO
same	OO
skin	OO
color	OO
as	OO
me	,O
she's	OO
much	OO
darker	OO
than	OO
i	OU
am	.O
so	,U
could	OO
you	OO
imagine	OO
me	OO
having	OO
a	OO
dark	OO
paste	OO
of	OO
face	,O
and	OO
the	OO
rest	OO
of	OO
me	OO
as	OO
like	OO
brown	,O
white	?O
i	OU
obviously	OO
didn't	OO
feel	OO
comfortable	,O
but	OO
my	OO
mom	OO
was	OO
trying	OO
to	OO
make	OO
me	OO
feel	OO
comfortable	.O
i	OU
was	OO
alienated	.O
in	OU
school	,O
i	OU
changed	OO
school	OO
in	OO
about	OO
grade	OO
3	,O
grade	OO
2	OO
and	OO
it's	OO
already	OO
hard	OO
to	OO
make	OO
friends	OO
when	OO
you	OO
change	OO
school	OO
especially	OO
at	OO
such	OO
a	OO
young	OO
age	,O
but	OO
luckily	OO
i	OU
found	OO
two	OO
girls	OO
who	OO
were	OO
willing	OO
to	OO
play	OO
with	OO
me	.O
they	OU
didn't	OO
really	OO
know	OO
who	OO
i	OU
was	,O
but	OO
they	OO
wanted	OO
to	OO
play	,O
they	OO
wanted	OO
to	OO
check	OO
me	OO
out	OO
and	OO
see	OO
if	OO
i	OU
was	OO
one	OO
of	OO
the	OO
cool	OO
kids	.O
and	OU
after	OO
a	OO
few	OO
weeks	OO
of	OO
being	OO
in	OO
that	OO
school	OO
and	OO
having	OO
those	OO
friends	,O
all	OO
of	OO
the	OO
sudden	,O
i	OU
didn't	OO
have	OO
them	.O
and	OU
i	OU
was	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
confused	OO
as	OO
to	OO
why	OO
i	OU
was	OO
struggling	OO
to	OO
make	OO
friends	.O
i	OU
finally	OO
did	OO
and	OO
now	,O
where	OO
did	OO
they	OO
go	?O
they	OU
would	OO
avoid	OO
me	OO
at	OO
recess	,O
they	OO
would	OO
avoid	OO
me	OO
at	OO
lunch	,O
and	OO
i	OU
finally	OO
went	OO
up	OO
to	OO
them	OO
one	OO
day	OO
and	OO
was	OO
like	,O
guys	,U
what's	OO
going	OO
on	?O
why	OU
aren't	OO
you	OO
talking	OO
to	OO
me	OO
anymore	?O
they	OU
said	OO
to	OO
me	,O
we	OU
can't	OO
talk	OO
to	OO
you	OO
anymore	,O
sorry	.O
our	OU
parents	OO
said	OO
that	OO
we	OO
might	OO
catch	OO
your	OO
skin	OO
condition	.O
can	OU
you	OO
imagine	OO
how	OO
that	OO
made	OO
me	OO
feel	OO
in	OO
grade	OO
2	,O
grade	OO
3	?O
that	OU
hurt	.O
i	OU
was	OO
alienated	,O
i	OU
was	OO
embarrassed	,O
to	OO
be	OO
honest	.O
i	OU
didn't	OO
know	OO
what	OO
this	OO
skin	OO
condition	OO
was	OO
in	OO
grade	OO
2	OO
or	OO
grade	OO
3	.O
i	OU
wasn't	OO
asked	OO
if	OO
i	OU
wanted	OO
this	OO
skin	OO
condition	.O
i	OU
didn't	OO
ask	OO
for	OO
it	,O
yet	OO
i	OU
was	OO
alienated	OO
for	OO
it	.O
but	OU
here's	OO
the	OO
thing	,O
when	OO
i	OU
got	OO
a	OO
little	OO
bit	OO
older	,O
i	OU
didn't	OO
want	OO
to	OO
be	OO
in	OO
that	OO
position	OO
anymore	,O
i	OU
didn't	OO
want	OO
to	OO
be	OO
bullied	.O
so	OU
rather	OO
that	OO
taking	OO
myself	OO
out	OO
of	OO
the	OO
position	,O
what	OO
did	OO
i	OU
do	?O
i	OU
became	OO
the	OO
bully	.O
and	OU
it's	OO
not	OO
better	OO
on	OO
one	OO
side	OO
than	OO
the	OO
other	.O
i	OU
can	OO
tell	OO
you	,O
because	OO
i've	OU
been	OO
on	OO
both	OO
sides	.O
i	OU
didn't	OO
want	OO
to	OO
be	OO
bullied	OO
anymore	OO
so	OO
i	OU
kind	OO
of	OO
took	OO
lead	OO
with	OO
those	OO
people	OO
who	OO
were	OO
bullying	OO
and	OO
i	OU
said	,O
cool	,U
those	OO
are	OO
going	OO
to	OO
be	OO
my	OO
friends	OO
now	OO
because	OO
i	OU
don't	OO
want	OO
to	OO
be	OO
bullied	,O
or	OO
on	OO
this	OO
side	OO
of	OO
the	OO
spectrum	.O
so	OU
i	OU
guess	OO
the	OO
only	OO
side	OO
is	OO
to	OO
be	OO
on	OO
this	OO
side	,O
this	OO
must	OO
be	OO
the	OO
good	OO
side	.O
so	OU
i	OU
decided	OO
to	OO
go	OO
to	OO
that	OO
side	.O
i	OU
would	OO
pick	OO
on	OO
kids	.O
i	OU
would	OO
be	OO
like	,O
so	OU
ugly	OO
your	OO
hair	.O
ugh	,U
who	OO
did	OO
that	?O
rude	,U
right	?O
but	OU
i	OU
came	OO
to	OO
a	OO
realization	OO
that	OO
i	OU
was	OO
trying	OO
to	OO
put	OO
myself	OO
into	OO
a	OO
mold	OO
that	OO
i	OU
didn't	OO

i	OU

who's	OO
to	OO
say	OO
that	OO
i'm	OU
supposed	OO
to	OO
fit	OO
in	OO
a	OO
mold	OO
anyway	?O
i	OU
can	OO
make	OO
my	OO
own	.O
so	,U
i	OU
decided	OO
that	OO
i	OU
was	OO
going	OO
to	OO
take	OO
myself	OO
away	OO
from	OO
this	OO
side	OO
and	OO
away	OO
from	OO
this	OO
side	,O
and	OO
make	OO
my	OO
own	OO
side	,O
and	OO
fit	OO
myself	OO
a	OO
new	OO
mold	.O
and	OU
that	OO
mold	OO
is	OO
so	OO
cliche	,O
but	OO
i	OU
feel	OO
that	OO
there	OO
is	OO
beauty	OO
in	OO
everything	.O
so	,U
i	OU
just	OO
want	OO
to	OO
put	OO
this	OO
idea	OO
in	OO
your	OO

that	OO
it	OO
takes	OO
one	OO
person	OO
to	OO
realize	OO
that	OO
there	OO

beauty	OO
in	OO
everything	.O
and	OU
you	OO

that's	OO
the	OO

someone	OU

i	OU

unfortunately	,U
we	OO

again	.O
that	OU
my	OO

with	OO

i	OU
stayed	OO
out	OO

that	OO

i	OU

that	OO
when	OO

of	OO

i	OU

this	OO

how	OO
i	OU

my	OU

from	OO

all	OO

i	OU
remember	OO

on	OO
the	OO

day	OO
of	OO

and	OO
seeing	OO
three	OO

a	OO
black	OO

—	OO
that's	OO
a	OO
thing	.O
by	OU
the	OO

of	OO
the	OO

i	OU

all	OO
in	.O
in	OU

a	OO
few	OO

after	OO

i	OU

doing	OO
something	OO
i	OU
prayed	OO
i	OU

i	OU
walked	OO
right	OO
back	OO
into	OO

but	OU
thankfully	,O
this	OO
time	OO
it	OO
was	OO
just	OO
as	OO
a	OO
student	,O
to	OO
join	OO
my	OO

and	OU
this	OO
time	,O
i	OU

to	OO
go	OO
home	OO
when	OO

was	OO
over	.O
in	OU
the	OO
next	OO
session	,O
we	OO

about	OO
what	OO

brought	OO
each	OO

us	OO
to	OO
this	OO
point	OO
of	OO
our	OO
lives	OO

into	OO
the	OO

together	.O
i	OU

enough	OO
to	OO
reveal	OO
my	OO
truth	OO
to	OO
everyone	OO
in	OO
the	OO
room	OO
about	OO
where	OO
i	OU
came	OO
from	.O
i	OU

about	OO
how	OO

i	OU
watched	OO
our	OO

suffer	OO
years	OO
of	OO
abuse	OO
at	OO

of	OO
our	OO
stepfather	,O
escaping	,O
only	OO
to	OO

ourselves	OO
living	OO
in	OO

about	OO

swore	OO
an	OO
oath	OO
to	OO
my	OO
family	OO
to	OO
keep	OO
them	OO
safe	.O
i	OU
even	OO
explained	OO
how	OO
i	OU
didn't	OO
feel	OO
like	OO
a	OO
teenager	OO
at	OO
13	,O
but	OO
more	OO
like	OO
a	OO
soldier	OO
on	OO
a	OO
mission	.O
and	OU
like	OO
any	OO
soldier	,O
this	OO
meant	OO
carrying	OO
an	OO

burden	OO
on	OO
my	OO

and	OO
i	OU
hate	OO
to	OO

it	,O

a	OO
gun	OO
on	OO
my	OO
waist	.O
and	OU
just	OO
a	OO
few	OO
days	OO
after	OO
my	OO
17th	OO
birthday	,O
that	OO
mission	OO
completely	OO
failed	.O
as	OU
my	OO
sister	OO
and	OO
i	OU
were	OO
walking	OO
to	OO
the	OO
laundromat	,O
a	OO
crowd	OO
stopped	OO
in	OO

of	OO
us	.O
two	OU
girls	OO
out	OO
of	OO
nowhere	OO
attacked	OO
my	OO
sister	.O
still	OU
confused	OO
about	OO
what	OO
was	OO
happening	,O
i	OU
tried	OO
to	OO
pull	OO
one	OO
girl	OO
away	,O
and	OO
just	OO
as	OO
i	OU
did	,O
i	OU
felt	OO
something	OO
brush	OO
across	OO
my	OO
face	.O
with	OU
my	OO
adrenaline	OO
rushing	,O
i	OU
didn't	OO
realize	OO
a	OO
man	OO
had	OO
leaped	OO
out	OO
of	OO
the	OO
crowd	OO
and	OO
cut	OO
me	.O
as	OU
i	OU
felt	OO
warm	OO
blood	OO
ooze	OO
down	OO
my	OO
face	,O
and	OO
watching	OO
him	OO
raise	OO
his	OO
knife	OO
toward	OO
me	OO
again	,O
i	OU
turned	OO
to	OO
defend	OO
myself	OO
and	OO
pulled	OO
that	OO
gun	OO
from	OO
my	OO
waistband	OO
and	OO
squeezed	OO
the	OO
trigger	.O
thankfully	,U
he	OO
didn't	OO
lose	OO
his	OO
life	OO
that	OO
day	.O
my	OU
hands	OO
shaking	OO
and	OO
heart	OO
racing	,O
i	OU
was	OO
paralyzed	OO
in	OO
fear	.O
from	OU
that	OO
moment	,O
i	OU
felt	OO
regret	OO
that	OO
would	OO
never	OO
leave	OO
me	.O
i	OU
learned	OO
later	OO
on	OO
they	OO
attacked	OO
my	OO
sister	OO
in	OO
a	OO
case	OO
of	OO
mistaken	OO
identity	,O
thinking	OO
she	OO
was	OO
someone	OO
else	.O
it	OU
was	OO
terrifying	,O
but	OO
clear	OO
that	OO
i	OU
wasn't	OO
trained	,O
nor	OO
was	OO
i	OU
qualified	,O
to	OO
be	OO
the	OO
soldier	OO
that	OO
i	OU
thought	OO
i	OU
needed	OO
to	OO
be	.O
but	OU
in	OO
my	OO
neighborhood	,O
i	OU
only	OO
felt	OO
safe	OO
carrying	OO
a	OO
weapon	.O
now	,U
back	OO
in	OO
the	OO
classroom	,O
after	OO
hearing	OO
my	OO
story	,O
the	OO
prosecutors	OO
could	OO
tell	OO
i	OU
never	OO
wanted	OO
to	OO
hurt	OO
anyone	.O
i	OU
just	OO
wanted	OO
us	OO
to	OO
make	OO
it	OO
home	.O
i	OU
could	OO
literally	OO
see	OO
the	OO
gradual	OO
change	OO
in	OO
each	OO
of	OO
their	OO
faces	OO
as	OO
they	OO
heard	OO
story	OO
after	OO
story	OO
from	OO
the	OO
other	OO
incarcerated	OO
men	OO
in	OO
the	OO
room	.O
stories	OU
that	OO
have	OO
trapped	OO
many	OO
of	OO
us	OO
within	OO
the	OO
vicious	OO
cycle	OO
of	OO
incarceration	,O
that	OO
most	OO
haven't	OO
been	OO
able	OO
to	OO
break	OO
free	OO
of	.O
and	OU
sure	OO
—	OO
there	OO
are	OO
people	OO
who	OO

but	OU
the	OO
stories	OO
of	OO
these	OO
individuals'	OO

before	OO

those	OO
acts	OO

the	OO
kinds	OO
of	OO
stories	OO
these	OO
prosecutors	OO
had	OO
never	OO
heard	.O
and	OU
when	OO
it	OO
was	OO
their	OO
turn	OO
to	OO
speak	OO
—	OO
the	OO
prosecutors	OO
—	OO
i	OU
was	OO
surprised	,O
too	.O
they	OU
weren't	OO
emotionless	OO
drones	OO
or	OO
robocops	,O
preprogrammed	OO
to	OO
send	OO
people	OO
to	OO
prison	.O
they	OU
were	OO
sons	OO
and	OO
daughters	,O
brothers	OO
and	OO
sisters	.O
but	OU
most	OO
of	OO
all	,O
they	OO
were	OO
good	OO
students	.O
they	OU
were	OO
ambitious	OO
and	OO
motivated	.O
and	OU
they	OO
believed	OO
that	OO
they	OO
could	OO
use	OO
the	OO
power	OO
of	OO
law	OO
to	OO
protect	OO
people	.O
they	OU
were	OO
on	OO
a	OO
mission	OO
that	OO
i	OU
could	OO
definitely	OO
understand	.O
midway	OU
through	OO
the	OO
course	,O
nick	,U
a	OO
fellow	OO
incarcerated	OO
student	,O
poured	OO
out	OO
his	OO
concern	OO
that	OO
the	OO
prosecutors	OO
were	OO
tiptoeing	OO
around	OO
the	OO
racial	OO
bias	OO
and	OO
discrimination	OO
within	OO
our	OO
criminal	OO
justice	OO
system	.O
now	,U
if	OO
you've	OO
ever	OO
been	OO
to	OO
prison	,O
you	OO
would	OO
know	OO
it's	OO
impossible	OO
to	OO
talk	OO
about	OO
justice	OO
reform	OO
without	OO
talking	OO
about	OO
race	.O
so	OU
we	OO
silently	OO
cheered	OO
for	OO
nick	OU
and	OO
were	OO
eager	OO
to	OO
hear	OO
the	OO
prosecutors'	OO
response	.O
and	OU
no	,O
i	OU
don't	OO
remember	OO
who	OO
spoke	OO
first	,O
but	OO
when	OO
chauncey	OU
parker	,U
a	OO
senior	OO
prosecutor	,O
agreed	OO
with	OO
nick	OU
and	OO
said	OO
he	OO
was	OO
committed	OO
to	OO
ending	OO
the	OO
mass	OO
incarceration	OO
of	OO
people	OO
of	OO
color	,O
i	OU
believed	OO
him	.O
and	OU
i	OU
knew	OO
we	OO
were	OO
headed	OO
in	OO
the	OO
right	OO
direction	.O
we	OU
now	OO
started	OO
to	OO
move	OO
as	OO
a	OO
team	.O
we	OU
started	OO
exploring	OO
new	OO
possibilities	OO
and	OO
uncovering	OO
truths	OO
about	OO
our	OO
justice	OO
system	OO
and	OO
how	OO
real	OO
change	OO
happens	OO
for	OO
us	.O
for	OU
me	,O
it	OO
wasn't	OO
the	OO
mandatory	OO
programs	OO
inside	OO
of	OO
the	OO
prison	.O
instead	,U
it	OO
was	OO
listening	OO
to	OO
the	OO
advice	OO
of	OO
elders	OO

men	OO
who	OO
have	OO
been	OO
sentenced	OO
to	OO
spend	OO
the	OO
rest	OO
of	OO
their	OO
lives	OO
in	OO

these	OU
men	OO
helped	OO
me	OO
reframe	OO
my	OO
mindset	OO
around	OO
manhood	.O
and	OU
they	OO
instilled	OO
in	OO
me	OO
all	OO
of	OO

in	OO
the	OO
hopes	OO
that	OO

that	OO

would	OO
serve	OO
as	OO
their	OO

to	OO
the	OO

as	OU
i	OU

i	OU
could	OO
see	OO
the	OO
lights	OO
turning	OO
on	OO
for	OO
one	OO
prosecutor	,O
who	OO
said	OO
something	OO
i	OU
thought	OO
was	OO
obvious:	OO
that	OO
i	OU
had	OO
transformed	OO
despite	OO
my	OO
incarceration	OO
and	OO
not	OO
because	OO
of	OO
it	.O
it	OU
was	OO
clear	OO
these	OO
prosecutors	OO
hadn't	OO
thought	OO
much	OO
about	OO
what	OO
happens	OO
to	OO
us	OO
after	OO
they	OO
win	OO
a	OO
conviction	.O
but	OU
through	OO
the	OO
simple	OO
process	OO
of	OO
sitting	OO
in	OO
a	OO
classroom	,O
these	OO
lawyers	OO
started	OO
to	OO
see	OO
that	OO
keeping	OO
us	OO
locked	OO
up	OO
didn't	OO
benefit	OO
our	OO
community	OO
or	OO
us	.O
toward	OU
the	OO
end	OO
of	OO
the	OO
course	,O
the	OO
prosecutors	OO

excited	,O
as	OO
we	OO
talked	OO
about	OO
our	OO
plans	OO
for	OO
life	OO
after	OO

how	OO

going	OO
to	OO

i	OU
can	OO
literally	OO
still	OO

the	OO
shock	OO
on	OO
one	OO
of	OO
the	OO
junior	OO

when	OO
it	OO
hit	OO

that	OO

how	OO

in	OO
the	OO
world	.O
it's	OU
used	OO
in	OO
all	OO
sorts	OO
of	OO
food	OO
and	OO
drink	OO
containers	,O
with	OO
the	OO
most	OO
notorious	OO
example	OO
being	OO
plastic	OO
water	OO
bottles	,O
of	OO
which	OO
we	OO
humans	OO
currently	OO
go	OO
through	OO
at	OO
a	OO
rate	OO
of	OO
one	OO
million	OO
per	OO
minute	.O
so	,U
what	OO
i	OU
would	OO
be	OO
doing	,O
is	OO
essentially	OO
putting	OO
my	OO
bacteria	OO
on	OO
a	OO
forced	OO
diet	OO
of	OO
pet	OU
plastic	OO
and	OO
seeing	OO
which	,O
if	OO
any	,O
might	OO
survive	OO
or	,O
hopefully	,O
thrive	.O
see	,U
this	OO
type	OO
of	OO
experiment	OO
would	OO
act	OO
as	OO
a	OO
screen	OO
for	OO
bacteria	OO
that	OO
had	OO
adapted	OO
to	OO
their	OO
plastic	OO
polluted	OO
environment	OO
and	OO
evolved	OO
the	OO
incredibly	OO
cool	OO
ability	OO
to	OO
eat	OO
pet	OU
plastic	.O
and	OU
using	OO
this	OO
screen	,O
i	OU
was	OO
able	OO
to	OO
find	OO
some	OO
bacteria	OO
that	OO
had	OO
done	OO
just	OO
that	.O
these	OU
bacteria	OO
had	OO
figured	OO
out	OO
how	OO
to	OO
eat	OO
pet	OU
plastic	.O
so	OU
how	OO
do	OO
these	OO
bacteria	OO
do	OO
this	?O
well	,U
it's	OO
actually	OO
pretty	OO
simple	.O
just	OU
as	OO
we	OO
humans	OO
digest	OO
carbon	OO
or	OO
food	OO
into	OO
chunks	OO
of	OO
sugar	OO
that	OO
we	OO
then	OO
use	OO
for	OO
energy	,O
so	OO
too	OO
do	OO
my	OO
bacteria	.O
my	OU
bacteria	,O
however	,O
have	OO
figured	OO
out	OO
how	OO
to	OO
do	OO
this	OO
digestion	OO
process	OO
to	OO
big	,O
tough	,O
durable	OO
pet	OU
plastic	.O
now	,U
to	OO
do	OO
this	,O
my	OO
bacteria	OO
use	OO
a	OO
special	OO
version	OO
of	OO
what's	OO
called	OO
an	OO
enzyme	.O
now	,U
enzymes	OO
are	OO
simply	OO
compounds	OO
that	OO
exist	OO
in	OO
all	OO
living	OO
things	.O
there	OU
are	OO
many	OO
different	OO
types	OO
of	OO
enzymes	,O
but	OO
basically	,O
they	OO
make	OO
processes	OO
go	OO
forward	,O
such	OO
as	OO
the	OO
digestion	OO
of	OO
food	OO
into	OO
energy	.O
for	OU
instance	,O
we	OO
humans	OO
have	OO
an	OO
enzyme	OO
called	OO
an	OO
amylase	OO
that	OO
helps	OO
us	OO
digest	OO
complex	OO
starches	,O
such	OO
as	OO
bread	,O
into	OO
small	OO
chunks	OO
of	OO
sugar	OO
that	OO
we	OO
can	OO
then	OO
use	OO
for	OO
energy	.O
now	,U
my	OO
bacteria	OO
have	OO
a	OO
special	OO
enzyme	OO
called	OO
a	OO
lipase	OO
that	OO
binds	OO
to	OO
big	,O
tough	,O
durable	OO
pet	OU
plastic	OO
and	OO
helps	OO
break	OO
it	OO
into	OO
small	OO
chunks	OO
of	OO
sugar	OO
that	OO
my	OO
bacteria	OO
can	OO
then	OO
use	OO
for	OO
energy	.O
so	OU
basically	,O
pet	OU
plastic	OO
goes	OO
from	OO
being	OO
a	OO
big	,O
tough	,O
long	OO
lasting	OO
pollutant	OO
to	OO
a	OO
tasty	OO
meal	OO
for	OO
my	OO
bacteria	.O
sounds	OU
pretty	OO
cool	,O
right	?O
and	OU
i	OU
think	,O
given	OO
the	OO
current	OO
scope	OO
of	OO
our	OO
plastic	OO
pollution	OO
problem	,O
i	OU
think	OO
it	OO
sounds	OO
pretty	OO
useful	.O
the	OU

i	OU

with	OO
you	OO
on	OO
just	OO
how	OO
much	OO
plastic	OO

has	OO
accumulated	OO
on	OO
our	OO

are	OO
daunting	.O
they're	OU
scary	.O
and	OU
i	OU
think	OO
they	OO
highlight	OO
that	OO
while	OO
reducing	,O
reusing	OO
and	OO
recycling	OO
are	OO
important	,O
they	OO
alone	OO
are	OO
not	OO
going	OO
to	OO
be	OO
enough	OO
to	OO
solve	OO
this	OO
problem	.O
and	OU
this	OO
is	OO
where	OO
i	OU
think	OO
bacteria	OO
might	OO
be	OO
able	OO
to	OO
help	OO
us	OO
out	.O
but	OU
i	OU
do	OO
understand	OO
why	OO
the	OO
concept	OO
of	OO
bacterial	OO
help	OO
might	OO
make	OO
some	OO
people	OO
a	OO
little	OO
nervous	.O
after	OU
all	,O
if	OO
plastic	OO
is	OO
everywhere	OO
and	OO
these	OO
bacteria	OO
eat	OO
plastic	,O
isn't	OO
there	OO
a	OO
risk	OO
of	OO
these	OO
bacteria	OO
getting	OO
out	OO
in	OO
the	OO
environment	OO
and	OO
wreaking	OO
havoc	?O
well	,U
the	OO
short	OO
answer	OO
is	OO
no	,O
and	OO
i'll	OU
tell	OO
you	OO
why	.O
these	OU
bacteria	OO
are	OO
already	OO
in	OO
the	OO
environment	.O
the	OU
bacteria	OO
in	OO
my	OO
research	OO
are	OO
not	OO
genetically	OO
modified	OO
frankenbugs	.O
these	OU
are	OO
naturally	OO
occurring	OO
bacteria	OO
that	OO
have	OO
simply	OO
adapted	OO
to	OO
their	OO
plastic	OO
polluted	OO
environment	OO
and	OO
evolved	OO
the	OO
incredibly	OO
gnarly	OO
ability	OO
to	OO
eat	OO
pet	OU
plastic	.O
so	OU
the	OO
process	OO
of	OO
bacteria	OO
eating	OO
plastic	OO
is	OO
actually	OO
a	OO
natural	OO
one	.O
but	OU
it's	OO
an	OO
incredibly	OO
slow	OO
process	.O
and	OU
there	OO
remains	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
work	OO
to	OO
be	OO
done	OO
to	OO
figure	OO
out	OO
how	OO
to	OO
speed	OO
up	OO
this	OO
process	OO
to	OO
a	OO
useful	OO
pace	.O
my	OU
research	OO
is	OO
currently	OO
looking	OO
at	OO
ways	OO
of	OO
doing	OO
this	OO
through	OO
a	OO
series	OO
of	OO
uv	,U
or	OO
ultraviolet	,O
pretreatments	,O
which	OO
basically	OO
means	OO
we	OO
blast	OO
pet	OU
plastic	OO
with	OO
sunlight	.O
we	OU
do	OO
this	OO
because	OO
sunlight	OO
acts	OO
a	OO
bit	OO
like	OO
tenderizer	OO
on	OO
a	OO

turning	OO
the	OO
big	,O

a	OO

softer	OO
and	OO
a	OO

for	OO
my	OO

to	OO

ultimately	,U
what	OO
my	OO

hopes	OO
to	OO
do	OO
is	OO
create	OO
an	OO
industrial	OO

to	OO

in	OO
a	OO

it's	OO

that	OO
we	OO

that	OO

piece	OO
about	OO
how	OO

avocado	OO
toast	.O
it	OU
was	OO
a	OO
confusing	OO
time	.O
those	OU
stories	OO
kept	OO
popping	OO
up	,O
but	OO
in	OO
2018	,O
those	OO
stories	OO
got	OO
changed	OO
out	OO
for	OO
a	OO
different	OO
type	OO
of	OO
story	,O
stories	OO
like	,O
white	OU

on	OU
black	OU
woman	OU
waiting	OU
for	OU
an	OU
uber	.U
that	OU

brooklyn	OU

eight	OU

in	OU
oakland	.U
that	OU
was	OO
now	OO
infamous	OO
bbq	OU
becky	.U
and	OU
i	OU
contend	OO
that	OO
these	OO
stories	OO
of	OO
living	OO
while	OO
black	OO
are	OO
actually	OO
progress	.O
we	OU
used	OO
to	OO
find	OO
out	OO
after	OO
the	OO
extrajudicial	OO
police	OO
killings	.O
now	,U
we're	OO
getting	OO
video	OO
of	OO
people	OO
calling	OO
911	.O
we're	OU
moving	OO
upstream	,O
closer	OO
to	OO
the	OO
problem	OO
and	OO
closer	OO
to	OO
the	OO
solution	.O
so	OU
i	OU
started	OO
a	OO
collection	OO
of	OO
as	OO
many	OO
of	OO
these	OO
stories	OO
as	OO
i	OU
could	OO
find	.O
i	OU
built	OO
an	OO
evolving	,O
still	OO
growing	OO
database	OO
at	OO
baratunde.com/livingwhileblack	.O
seeking	OU
understanding	,O
i	OU
realized	OO
the	OO
process	OO
was	OO
really	OO
diagramming	OO
sentences	OO
to	OO
understand	OO
these	OO
headlines	.O
and	OU
i	OU
want	OO
to	OO
thank	OO
my	OO
sidwell	OU
english	OU
teacher	OO
erica	OU
berry	OU
and	OO
all	OO
english	OU
teachers	.O
you	OU
have	OO
given	OO
us	OO
tools	OO
to	OO
fight	OO
for	OO
our	OO
own	OO
freedom	.O
what	OU
i	OU
found	OO
was	OO
a	OO
process	OO
to	OO
break	OO
down	OO
the	OO
headline	OO
and	OO
understand	OO
the	OO
consistent	OO
layers	OO
in	OO
each	OO
one:	OO
a	OO
subject	OO
takes	OO
an	OO
action	OO
against	OO
a	OO
target	OO
engaged	OO
in	OO
some	OO
activity	,O
so	OO
that	OO
white	OU
woman	OU
calls	OU
police	OU
on	OU
eight	OU
year	OU
old	OU
black	OU
girl	OU
is	OO
the	OO
same	OO
as	OO
white	OU
man	OU
calls	OU
police	OU
on	OU
black	OU
woman	OU
using	OU
neighborhood	OU
pool	OU
is	OO
the	OO
same	OO
as	OO
woman	OU
calls	OU
cops	OU
on	OU
black	OU
oregon	OU
lawmaker	OU
campaigning	OU
in	OU
her	OU
district	.U
they're	OU
the	OO
same	.O
diagramming	OU
the	OO
sentences	OO
allowed	OO
me	OO
to	OO
diagram	OO
the	OO
white	OO
supremacy	OO
which	OO
allowed	OO
such	OO
sentences	OO
to	OO
be	OO
true	,O
and	OO
i	OU
will	OO
pause	OO
to	OO
define	OO
my	OO
terms	.O
when	OU
i	OU
say	OO
white	OO
supremacy	,O
i'm	OU
not	OO
just	OO
talking	OO
about	OO
nazis	OU
or	OO
white	OO
power	OO
activists	,O
and	OO
i'm	OU
definitely	OO
not	OO
saying	OO
that	OO
all	OO
white	OO
people	OO
are	OO
racist	.O
what	OU
i'm	OU
referring	OO
to	OO
is	OO
a	OO
system	OO
of	OO
structural	OO
advantage	OO
that	OO
favors	OO
white	OO
people	OO
over	OO
others	OO
in	OO
social	,O
economic	OO
and	OO
political	OO
arenas	.O
it's	OU
what	OO
bryan	OU
stevenson	OU
at	OO
the	OO
equal	OU
justice	OU
initiative	OU
calls	OO
the	OO
narrative	OO
of	OO
racial	OO
difference	,O
the	OO
story	OO
we	OO
told	OO
ourselves	OO
to	OO
justify	OO
slavery	OO
and	OO
jim	OU
crow	OU
and	OO
mass	OO
incarceration	OO
and	OO
beyond	.O
so	OU
when	OO
i	OU
saw	OO
this	OO
pattern	OO
repeating	,O
i	OU
got	OO
angry	,O
but	OO
i	OU
also	OO
got	OO
inspired	OO
to	OO
create	OO
a	OO
game	,O
a	OO
game	OO
of	OO
words	OO
that	OO
would	OO
allow	OO
me	OO
to	OO
transform	OO
this	OO
traumatic	OO
exposure	OO
into	OO
more	OO
of	OO
a	OO
healing	OO
experience	.O
i'm	OU
going	OO
to	OO
talk	OO
you	OO
through	OO
the	OO
game	.O
the	OU
first	OO
level	OO
is	OO
a	OO
training	OO
level	,O
and	OO
i	OU
need	OO
your	OO
participation	.O
our	OU
objective:	OO
to	OO
determine	OO
if	OO
this	OO
is	OO
real	OO
or	OO
fake	.O
did	OU
this	OO
happen	OO
or	OO
not	?O
here	OU
is	OO
the	OO
example:	OO
catholic	OU
university	OU
law	OU
librarian	OU
calls	OU
police	OU
on	OU
student	OU
for	OU
'being	OO
argumentative.'	OU
clap	OU
your	OO
hands	OO
if	OO
you	OO
think	OO
this	OO
is	OO
real	.O
clap	OU
your	OO
hands	OO
if	OO
you	OO
think	OO
this	OO
is	OO
fake	.O
the	OU
reals	OO
have	OO
it	,O
unfortunately	,O
and	OO
a	OO
point	OO
of	OO
information	,O
being	OO
argumentative	OO
in	OO
a	OO
law	OO
library	OO
is	OO
the	OO
exact	OO
right	OO
place	OO
to	OO
do	OO
that	.O
this	OU
student	OO
should	OO
be	OO
promoted	OO
to	OO
professor	.O
training	OU
level	OO
complete	,O
so	OO
we	OO
move	OO
on	OO
to	OO
the	OO
real	OO
levels	.O
level	OU
one	,O
our	OO
objective	OO
is	OO
simple:	OO
reverse	OO
the	OO
roles	.O
that	OU
means	OO
woman	OU
calls	OU
cops	OU
on	OU
black	OU
oregon	OU
lawmaker	OU
becomes	OO
black	OU
oregon	OU
lawmaker	OU
calls	OU
cops	OU
on	OU
woman	.U
that	OU
means	OO
white	OU
man	OU
calls	OU
police	OU
on	OU
black	OU
woman	OU
using	OU
neighborhood	OU
pool	OU
becomes	OO
black	OU
woman	OU
calls	OU
police	OU
on	OU
white	OU
man	OU
using	OU
neighborhood	OU
pool	.U
how	OU
do	OO
you	OO
like	OO
them	OO
reverse	OO
racist	OO
apples	?O
that's	OU
it	,O
level	OO
one	OO
complete	,O
and	OO
so	OO
we	OO
level	OO
up	OO
to	OO
level	OO
two	,O
where	OO
our	OO
objective	OO
is	OO
to	OO
increase	OO
the	OO
believability	OO
of	OO
the	OO
reversal	.O
let's	OU
face	OO
it	,O
a	OO
black	OO
woman	OO
calling	OO
police	OO
on	OO
a	OO
white	OO
man	OO
using	OO
a	OO
pool	OO
isn't	OO
absurd	OO
enough	,O
but	OO
what	OO
if	OO
that	OO
white	OO
man	OO
was	OO
trying	OO
to	OO
touch	OO
her	OO
hair	OO
without	OO
asking	,O
or	OO
maybe	OO
he	OO
was	OO
making	OO
oat	OO
milk	OO
while	OO
riding	OO
a	OO
unicycle	,O
or	OO
maybe	OO
he's	OO
just	OO
talking	OO
over	OO
everyone	OO
in	OO
a	OO
meeting	.O
we've	OU
all	OO
been	OO
there	,O
right	?O
seriously	,U
we've	OO
all	OO
been	OO
there	.O
so	OU
that's	OO
it	,O
level	OO
two	OO
complete	.O
but	OU
it	OO
comes	OO
with	OO
a	OO
warning:	OO
simply	OO
reversing	OO
the	OO
flow	OO
of	OO
injustice	OO
is	OO
not	OO
justice	.O
that	OU
is	OO
vengeance	,O
that	OO
is	OO
not	OO
our	OO
mission	,O
that's	OO
a	OO
different	OO
game	OO
so	OO
we	OO
level	OO
up	OO
to	OO
level	OO
three	,O
where	OO
the	OO
objective	OO
is	OO
to	OO
change	OO
the	OO
action	,O
also	OO
known	OO
as	OO
calling	OO
the	OO
police	OO
is	OO
not	OO
your	OO
only	OO
option	OO
omg	,U
what	OO
is	OO
wrong	OO
with	OO
you	OO
people	.O
and	OU
i	OU
need	OO
to	OO
pause	OO
the	OO
game	OO
to	OO
remind	OO
us	OO
of	OO
the	OO
structure	.O
a	OU
subject	OO

an	OO
action	OO
against	OO

these	OO

the	OO
subject	OO
is	OO

the	OO

my	OO

which	OO
is	OO
clearly	OO
a	OO
case	OO
for	OO

police	,O

people	OO
police	.O
all	OU
of	OO
these	OO
activities	OO
add	OO
up	OO
to	OO
living	.O
our	OU
existence	OO
is	OO
being	OO
interpreted	OO
as	OO
crime	.O
now	,U
this	OO
is	OO
the	OO
obligatory	OO
moment	OO
in	OO
the	OO

where	OO
i	OU
have	OO
to	OO

not	OO
everything	OO

about	OO

crime	OU
is	OO
a	OO
thing	,O
should	OO
be	OO
reported	,O

ask	OO

do	OO
we	OO
need	OO
armed	OO
men	OO
to	OO
show	OO
up	OO
and	OO
resolve	OO
this	OO
situation	,O
because	OO
when	OO
they	OO
show	OO
up	OO
for	OO
me	,O
it's	OO
different	.O
we	OU
know	OO
that	OO
police	OO
officers	OO
use	OO
force	OO
more	OO
with	OO
black	OO
people	OO
than	OO
with	OO
white	OO
people	,O
and	OO
we	OO
are	OO
learning	OO
the	OO
role	OO
of	OO
911	OO
calls	OO
in	OO
this	.O
thanks	OU
to	OO
preliminary	OO
research	OO
from	OO
the	OO
center	OU
for	OO
policing	OU
equity	,U
we're	OO
learning	OO
that	OO
in	OO
some	OO
cities	,O
most	OO
of	OO
the	OO
interactions	OO
between	OO
cops	OO
and	OO
citizens	OO
is	OO
due	OO
to	OO
911	OO
calls	,O
not	OO
officer	OO
initiated	OO

and	OO
most	OO
of	OO
the	OO
violence	,O
the	OO
use	OO
of	OO
force	OO
by	OO
police	OO
on	OO
citizens	,O
is	OO
in	OO

to	OO
those	OO
calls	.O
further	,U
when	OO
those	OO
officers	OO
responding	OO
to	OO
calls	OO
use	OO
force	,O
that	OO
increases	OO
in	OO
areas	OO
where	OO
the	OO
percentage	OO
of	OO
the	OO

also	OO
increased	,O

when	OO

the	OO
side	OO
of	OO
the	OO

the	OO

so	OO
that	OO
our	OO

we	OO
do	OO
this	OO

or	OO
save	OO
up	OO
for	OO
a	OO
car	OO
any	OO
time	OO
soon	.O
so	OU
troy	OU
saw	OO
how	OO
hard	OO
his	OO
immigrant	OO
mother	OO
from	OO
jamaica	OU
worked	OO
and	OO
how	OO
little	OO
she	OO
got	OO
back	OO
in	OO
return	,O
and	OO
he	OO
vowed	OO
—	OO
troy	OU
vowed	OO
to	OO
take	OO
a	OO
different	OO
path	.O
so	OU
he	OO
ended	OO
up	OO
selling	OO
drugs	.O
and	OU
then	OO
he	OO
got	OO
caught	,O
and	OO
right	OO
now	,O
he's	OO
trying	OO
to	OO
figure	OO
out	OO
his	OO
next	OO
steps	.O
in	OU
a	OO
country	OO
where	OO
money	OO
equals	OO
power	,O
quick	OO
money	,O
at	OO
least	OO
for	OO
a	OO
while	,O
gives	OO
young	OO
men	OO
and	OO
women	OO
like	OO
him	OO
a	OO
sense	OO
of	OO
control	OO
over	OO
their	OO
lives	,O
though	OO
he	OO
said	OO
he	OO
mainly	OO
did	OO
it	OO
because	OO
he	OO
wanted	OO
stability	.O
i	OU
wanted	OO
a	OO
good	OO
life	,O
he	OO
told	OO
me	.O
i	OU
got	OO
greedy	OO
and	OO
i	OU
got	OO
caught	.O
yet	OU
the	OO
amazing	OO
thing	OO
about	OO
troy	OU
is	OO
that	OO
he	OO
still	OO
believes	OO
in	OO
the	OO
american	OU
dream	.O
he	OU
still	OO
believes	OO
that	OO
with	OO
hard	OO
work	,O
despite	OO
being	OO
arrested	,O
that	OO
he	OO
can	OO
move	OO
on	OO
up	.O
now	,U
i	OU
don't	OO
know	OO
if	OO
troy's	OU
dreams	OO
came	OO
true	.O
he	OU
disappeared	OO
from	OO
the	OO
program	OO
for	OO
troubled	OO
youth	OO
that	OO
he	OO
was	OO
involved	OO
in	OO
and	OO
slipped	OO
through	OO
the	OO
cracks	,O
but	OO
on	OO
that	OO
day	OO
that	OO
we	OO
spoke	,O
i	OU
could	OO
tell	OO
that	OO
more	OO
than	OO
anything	,O
troy	OU
was	OO
happy	OO
that	OO
someone	OO
listened	OO
to	OO
his	OO
dreams	OO
and	OO
asked	OO
him	OO
about	OO
his	OO
future	.O
so	OU
i	OU
think	OO
about	OO
troy	OU
and	OO
his	OO
optimism	OO
when	OO
i	OU
think	OO
of	OO
the	OO
reality	OO
that	OO
so	OO
many	OO
young	,O
black	OO
millennials	OO
face	OO
when	OO
it	OO
comes	OO
to	OO
realizing	OO
their	OO
dreams	.O
i	OU
think	OO
about	OO
all	OO
the	OO
challenges	OO
that	OO
so	OO
many	OO
black	OO
millennials	OO
have	OO
to	OO
endure	OO
in	OO
a	OO
world	OO
that	OO
tells	OO
them	OO
they	OO
can	OO
anything	OO
they	OO
want	OO
to	OO
be	OO
if	OO
they	OO
work	OO
hard	,O
but	OO
actually	OO
doesn't	OO
sit	OO
down	OO
to	OO
listen	OO
to	OO
their	OO
dreams	OO
or	OO
hear	OO
stories	OO
about	OO
their	OO
struggle	.O
and	OU
we	OO
really	OO
need	OO
to	OO
listen	OO
to	OO
this	OO
generation	OO
if	OO
we	OO
hope	OO
to	OO
have	OO
a	OO
healthy	OO
and	OO
civil	OO
society	OO
going	OO
forward	,O
because	OO
millienials	OO
of	OO
color	,O
they	OO
make	OO
up	OO
a	OO
fair	OO
chunk	OO
of	OO
the	OO
us	OU
and	OO
the	OO
world	OO
population	.O
now	OU
when	OO
we	OO
talk	OO
about	OO
millennials	,O
a	OO
group	OO
that	OO
is	OO
often	OO
labeled	OO
as	OO
entitled	,O
lazy	,O
overeducated	,O
noncommittal	OO
and	OO
narcissistic	,O
the	OO
conversations	OO

around	OO
avocado	OO

abroad	OO
—	OO
you	OO
probably	OO
have	OO
heard	OO
all	OO
these	OO
things	OO
before	.O
but	OU
millennials	OO
are	OO
not	OO
a	OO
monolith	.O
actress	OU
lena	OU

may	OO
be	OO
the	OO

of	OO

but	OO
troy	OU
and	OO
other	OO
voices	OO
like	OO
his	OO
are	OO
also	OO
part	OO
of	OO
the	OO
story	.O
in	OU
fact	,O
millennials	OO
are	OO
the	OO
largest	OO
and	OO
most	OO
diverse	OO

in	OO
this	OO
country	.O
44	OO

all	OO

you	OO

even	OO

it	OO
at	OO
all	.O
now	OU
sure	,O
there	OO
are	OO
similarities	OO
within	OO
this	OO

born	OO
between	OO
1981	OO

1996	.O
perhaps	OU
many	OO
of	OO

do	OO
love	OO
avocado	OO

—	OO
i	OU
know	OO
i	OU
do	,O
right	?O
but	OU
there	OO
are	OO
also	OO
extreme	OO
differences	,O
often	OO
between	OO
millennials	OO
of	OO
color	OO

white	OO
millennials	.O
in	OU

all	OO

it	OO
seems	OO

we're	OO

a	OO

that	OO

the	OO

of	OO
the	OO

that	OO
we	OO
have	OO
when	OO
it	OO

to	OO
this	OO

we	OO

we	OO

we	OO

we	OO

—	OO
even	OO
when	OO
we	OO

and	OO
we	OO

at	OO

and	OU
honestly	,O
that's	OO
really	OO
just	OO
the	OO

now	,U
none	OO
of	OO
these	OO

people	OO
in	OO

have	OO
been	OO
fighting	,O
really	OO
fighting	OO
hard	OO
to	OO

after	OU
the	OO

the	OO

that	OO

to	OO
the	OO

the	OO

to	OO

of	OO
the	OO

in	OO

after	OU

black	OU
panthers	OU

then	OO
the	OO

they	OO
turned	OO
to	OO

when	OO

when	OO

even	OU
the	OO

research	OU

by	OO
the	OO
washington	OU

in	OO
2015	OO
about	OO
this	OO
supposedly	OO
woke	OO
group	OO

that	OO
31	OO

think	OO
that	OO

are	OO
lazier	OO

23	OO

they're	OO

these	OU

surprising	OO
things	OO
to	OO
me	,O
and	OO
shocking	.O
and	OU
these	OO
responses	OO
are	OO
not	OO
that	OO
much	OO
different	OO
than	OO
generations	OO
in	OO
the	OO
past	,O
and	OO
it	OO
shows	OO
that	OO
unfortunately	,O
this	OO
generation	OO
is	OO
repeating	OO
the	OO
same	OO
old	OO
stereotypes	OO
and	OO
tropes	OO
of	OO
the	OO
past	.O
now	,U
a	OO
study	OO
conducted	OO
by	OO
david	OU
binder	OU
research	OU
and	OO
mtv	OU
in	OO
2014	OO
—	OO
it	OO
found	OO
that	OO
84	OO
percent	OO
of	OO
young	OO
millennials	OO
were	OO
taught	OO
by	OO
their	OO
families	OO
that	OO
everyone	OO
should	OO
be	OO
equal	.O
this	OU
is	OO
a	OO
really	OO
great	OO
thing	,O
a	OO
really	OO
positive	OO
step	.O
but	OU
only	OO
37	OO
percent	OO
in	OO
that	OO
group	OO
actually	OO
talked	OO
about	OO
race	OO
with	OO
their	OO
families	.O
so	OU
i	OU
could	OO
understand	OO
why	OO
things	OO
may	OO
be	OO
confusing	OO
to	OO
some	.O
there	OU
are	OO
definitely	OO
black	OO
millennials	OO
who	OO
are	OO
succeeding	.O
marvel's	OU
black	OU
panther	,U
directed	OO
by	OO
black	OO
millennial	OO
ryan	OU
coogler	OU
and	OO
showcasing	OO
many	OO
others	,O
broke	OO
all	OO
sorts	OO
of	OO
records	.O
there's	OU
a	OO
crop	OO
of	OO
television	OO

by	OO
creatives	OO
like	OO
donald	OU
glover	,U
lena	OU
waithe	OU
and	OO
issa	OU
rae	.U
beyoncé	OU
is	,O
like	,O
the	OO
queen	,O
right	?O
she	OU
is	,O

everything	.O
young	OU
black	OO
authors	OO
are	OO
winning	OO

serena	OU

still	OO
dominating	OO
on	OO
the	OO

despite	OO
all	OO
her	OO

and	OO
there's	OO
a	OO
crop	OO
of	OO
new	OO
politicians	OO
and	OO
activists	OO
running	OO
for	OO

so	OU
i	OU
don't	OO
want	OO
to	,O
like	,O
kill	OO
these	OO
moments	OO
of	OO
black	OO
joy	OO
that	OO
i	OU
too	OO
revel	OO
in	,O
but	OO
i	OU
want	OO
to	OO
make	OO
it	OO
clear	OO
that	OO
these	OO
wins	OO
are	OO
too	OO
few	OO
and	OO
far	OO
between	OO
for	OO
a	OO
people	OO
that's	OO
been	OO
here	OO
for	OO
over	OO
400	OO
years	.O
like	,U
that's	OO
insane	,O
right	?O
and	OU
most	OO
people	OO
still	OO
don't	OO
really	OO
understand	OO
the	OO
full	OO
picture	,O
right	?O
our	OU
stories	OO
are	OO
still	OO
misunderstood	,O
our	OO
bodies	OO
are	OO
still	OO
taken	OO
advantage	OO
of	,O
and	OO
our	OO
voices	?O
our	OU
voices	OO
are	OO
silenced	OO
in	OO
a	OO
world	OO
that	OO
still	OO
shows	OO
little	OO
concern	OO
for	OO
our	OO
everyday	OO
struggles	.O
so	OU
our	OO
stories	OO
need	OO
to	OO
be	OO
told	OO
in	OO
a	OO
multitude	OO
of	OO
ways	OO
by	OO
a	OO
range	OO
of	OO

about	OO

they	OO
really	OO

to	OO
be	OO
listened	OO
to	.O
and	OU
it	OO
is	OO
not	OO
just	OO
here	OO
in	OO
america	,U
right	?O
it's	OU
all	OO
around	OO
the	OO
world	.O
millennials	OU
make	OO
up	OO
27	OO
percent	OO
of	OO
the	OO
world's	OO

that's	OU
around	OO
two	OO

accounting	OO
for	OO

the	OO

it's	OO
clear	OO
that	OO
the	OO
white	,O
often	OO
male	,O
heterosexual	OO
narrative	OO
of	OO
the	OO
millennial	OO
is	OO
only	OO
telling	OO

now	,U
there's	OO
many	OO
people	OO
trying	OO
to	OO

they're	OU
fighting	OO
to	OO

—	OO
i	OU
want	OO
to	OO
make	OO
it	OO
really	OO
clear	OO
to	OO
everyone	OO
that	OO
just	OO
because	OO
things	OO
look	OO
more	OO
equal	OO
than	OO
they	OO
did	OO
in	OO
the	OO
20th	OO
century	,O
doesn't	OO
mean	OO
that	OO
things	OO
are	OO
equitable	OO
at	OO
all	.O
it	OU
doesn't	OO
mean	OO
our	OO
experiences	OO
are	OO
equitable	,O
and	OO
it	OO
certainly	OO
doesn't	OO
mean	OO
that	OO
a	OO
post	OO
racial	OO
society	,O
that	OO
thing	OO
that	OO
we	OO
talked	OO
about	OO
so	OO
much	,O
ever	OO
became	OO
close	OO
to	OO
being	OO
a	OO
reality	.O
i	OU
think	OO
of	OO
joelle	,U
a	OO
middle	OO
class	OO
20	OO
something	OO
who	OO
did	OO
everything	OO
the	OO
right	OO
way	,O
but	OO
she	OO
couldn't	OO
go	OO
to	OO
her	OO
dream	OO
school	,O
because	OO
it	OO
was	OO
simply	OO
too	OO
expensive	.O
or	OU
jalessa	,U
who	OO
knows	OO
she	OO
can't	OO
be	OO
mediocre	OO
at	OO
her	OO
job	OO
the	OO
same	OO
way	OO
that	OO
her	OO
white	OO
peers	OO
can	.O
or	OU
trina	,U
who	OO
knows	OO
that	OO
people	OO
judge	OO
her	OO
unconventional	OO
family	OO
choices	OO
in	OO
a	OO
different	OO
way	OO
than	OO
if	OO
she	OO
were	OO
a	OO
white	OO
woman	.O
or	OU
actor	OO
ab	,U
who	OO
knows	OO
that	OO
the	OO
roles	OO
he	OO
takes	OO
and	OO
gets	OO
in	OO
hollywood	OU
are	OO
different	OO
because	OO
of	OO
his	OO
skin	OO
color	.O
and	OU
then	OO
there's	OO
simon	.U
so	OU
simon	,U
by	OO
all	OO
means	,O
would	OO
be	OO
an	OO
example	OO
of	OO
someone	OO
who's	OO
made	OO
it	.O
he's	OU
a	OO
cfo	OU
at	OO
a	OO
tech	OO
company	OO
in	OO
san	OU
francisco	,U
he	OO
has	OO
a	OO
degree	OO
from	OO
mit	OU
and	OO
he's	OO
worked	OO
at	OO
some	OO
of	OO
the	OO
hottest	OO
tech	OO
companies	OO
in	OO
the	OO
world	.O
but	OU
when	OO
i	OU
asked	OO
simon	OU
if	OO
he	OO
had	OO
achieved	OO
the	OO
american	OU
dream	,O
it	OO
took	OO
him	OO
a	OO
while	OO
to	OO
respond	.O
while	OU
acknowledging	OO
that	OO
he	OO
had	OO
a	OO
really	OO
comfortable	OO
life	,O
he	OO
admitted	OO
that	OO
under	OO
different	OO
circumstances	,O
he	OO
might	OO
have	OO
chosen	OO
a	OO
different	OO
path	.O
simon	OU
really	OO
loves	OO
photography	,O
but	OO
that	OO
was	OO
never	OO
a	OO
real	OO
option	OO
for	OO
him	.O
my	OU
parents	OO
weren't	OO
able	OO
to	OO
subsidize	OO
me	OO
through	OO
that	OO
sort	OO
of	OO
thing	,O
simon	OU
said	.O
maybe	OU
that's	OO
something	OO
my	OO
children	OO
could	OO
do	.O
so	OU
it's	OO
these	OO
kinds	OO
of	OO
stories	OO
—	OO
the	OO
quieter	,O
more	OO
subtle	OO
ones	OO
—	OO
that	OO
reveal	OO
the	OO
often	OO
unique	OO
and	OO
untold	OO
stories	OO
of	OO
black	OO
millennials	OO
that	OO
show	OO
how	OO
even	OO

may	OO
differ	OO
between	OO
communities	.O
so	OU
we	OO
really	OO
need	OO
to	OO
listen	OO
and	OO
hear	OO
the	OO
stories	OO
of	OO
this	OO
generation	,O
now	OO
more	OO
than	OO
ever	,O
as	OO
the	OO
baby	OO
boomers	OO
age	OO
and	OO
millennials	OO
come	OO
to	OO
prominence	.O
we	OU
can	OO
talk	OO
all	OO
we	OO
want	OO
to	OO
about	OO
pickling	OO
businesses	OO
in	OO
brooklyn	OU
or	OO
avocado	OO
toast	,O
but	OO
leaving	OO
out	OO
the	OO
stories	OO
and	OO
the	OO
voices	OO
of	OO
black	OO
millennials	,O
large	OO
swaths	OO
of	OO
the	OO
population	OO
—	OO
it	OO
will	OO
only	OO
increase	OO
divisions	.O
so	OU
stories	OO
of	OO
black	OO
millennials	,O
brown	OO
millennials	OO
and	OO
all	OO
millennials	OO
of	OO
color	OO
really	OO
need	OO
to	OO
be	OO
told	,O
and	OO
they	OO
also	OO
need	OO
to	OO
be	OO
listened	OO
to	.O
we'd	OU
be	OO
a	OO
far	OO
better	OO
off	OO
country	OO
and	OO
world	.O
thank	OU
you	.O
i'm	OU
an	OO
astronomer	OO
who	OO
builds	OO
telescopes	.O
i	OU
build	OO
telescopes	OO
because	,O
number	OO
one	,O
they	OO
are	OO
awesome	.O
but	OU
number	OO
two	,O
i	OU
believe	OO
if	OO
you	OO
want	OO
to	OO
discover	OO
a	OO
new	OO
thing	OO
about	OO
the	OO
universe	,O
you	OO
have	OO
to	OO
look	OO
at	OO
the	OO
universe	OO
in	OO
a	OO
new	OO
way	.O
new	OU
technologies	OO
in	OO
astronomy	OO
—	OO
things	OO
like	OO
lenses	,O
photographic	OO
plates	,O
all	OO
the	OO
way	OO
up	OO
to	OO
space	OO
telescopes	OO
—	OO
each	OO
gave	OO
us	OO
new	OO
ways	OO
to	OO
see	OO
the	OO
universe	OO
and	OO
directly	OO
led	OO
to	OO
a	OO
new	OO
understanding	OO
of	OO
our	OO
place	OO
in	OO
it	.O
but	OU
those	OO
discoveries	OO
come	OO
with	OO
a	OO
cost	.O
it	OU
took	OO
thousands	OO
of	OO
people	OO
and	OO
44	OO
years	OO
to	OO
get	OO
the	OO
hubble	OU
space	OU
telescope	OU
from	OO
an	OO
idea	OO
into	OO
orbit	.O
it	OU
takes	OO
time	,O
it	OO
takes	OO
a	OO
tolerance	OO
for	OO
failure	,O
it	OO
takes	OO
individual	OO
people	OO
choosing	OO
every	OO
day	OO
not	OO
to	OO
give	OO
up	.O
i	OU
know	OO
how	OO
hard	OO
that	OO
choice	OO
is	OO
because	OO
i	OU
live	OO
it	.O
the	OU
reality	OO
of	OO
my	OO
job	OO
is	OO
that	OO
i	OU
fail	OO
almost	OO
all	OO
the	OO
time	OO
and	OO
still	OO
keep	OO
going	,O
because	OO
that's	OO
how	OO
telescopes	OO
get	OO
built	.O
the	OU
telescope	OO
i	OU
helped	OO
build	OO
is	OO
called	OO
the	OO
faint	OO
intergalactic	OO
medium	OO
red	OO
shifted	OO
emission	OO
balloon	,O
which	OO
is	OO
a	OO
mouthful	,O
so	OO
we	OO
call	OO
it	OO
fireball	.U
and	OU
don't	OO
worry	,O
it	OO
is	OO
not	OO
going	OO
to	OO
explode	OO
at	OO
the	OO
end	OO
of	OO
this	OO
story	.O
i've	OU
been	OO
working	OO
on	OO
fireball	OU
for	OO
more	OO
than	OO
10	OO
years	OO
and	OO
now	OO
lead	OO
the	OO
team	OO
of	OO
incredible	OO
people	OO
who	OO
built	OO
it	.O
fireball	OU
is	OO
designed	OO
to	OO
observe	OO
some	OO
of	OO
the	OO
faintest	OO
structures	OO
known:	OO
huge	OO
clouds	OO
of	OO
hydrogen	OO
gas	.O
these	OU
clouds	OO
are	OO
giant	.O
they	OU
are	OO
even	OO
bigger	OO
than	OO
whatever	OO
you're	OO
thinking	OO
of	.O
they	OU
are	OO
huge	,O
huge	OO
clouds	OO
of	OO
hydrogen	OO
that	OO
we	OO
think	OO
flow	OO
into	OO
and	OO
out	OO
of	OO
galaxies	.O
i	OU
work	OO
on	OO
fireball	OU
because	OO
what	OO
i	OU
really	OO
want	OO
is	OO
to	OO
take	OO
our	OO
view	OO
of	OO
the	OO
universe	OO
from	OO
one	OO
with	OO
just	OO
light	OO
from	OO
stars	OO
to	OO
one	OO
where	OO
we	OO
can	OO
see	OO
and	OO
measure	OO
every	OO
atom	OO
that	OO
exists	.O
that's	OU
all	OO
that	OO
i	OU
want	OO
to	OO
do	.O
but	OU
observing	OO
at	OO
least	OO
some	OO
of	OO
those	OO
atoms	OO
is	OO
crucial	OO
to	OO
our	OO
understanding	OO
of	OO
why	OO
galaxies	OO
look	OO
the	OO
way	OO
they	OO
do	.O
i	OU
want	OO
to	OO
know	OO
how	OO
that	OO
hydrogen	OO
gas	OO
gets	OO
into	OO
a	OO
galaxy	OO
and	OO
creates	OO
a	OO
star	.O
my	OU
work	OO
on	OO
fireball	OU
started	OO
in	OO
2008	,O
working	OO
not	OO
on	OO
the	OO
telescope	OO
but	OO
on	OO
the	OO
light	OO
sensor	,O
which	OO
is	OO
the	OO
heart	OO
of	OO
any	OO
telescope	.O
this	OU
new	OO
sensor	OO
was	OO
being	OO
developed	OO
by	OO
a	OO
team	OO
that	OO
i	OU
joined	OO
at	OO
nasa's	OU
jet	OU
propulsion	OU
laboratory	.U
and	OU
our	OO
goal	OO
was	OO
to	OO
prove	OO
that	OO
this	OO
sensor	OO
would	OO
work	OO
really	OO
well	OO
to	OO
detect	OO
that	OO
hydrogen	OO
gas	.O
in	OU
my	OO
work	OO
on	OO
this	,O
i	OU
destroyed	OO
several	OO
very	,O
very	,O
very	OO
expensive	OO
sensors	OO
before	OO
realizing	OO
that	OO
the	OO
machine	OO
i	OU
was	OO
using	OO
created	OO
a	OO
plasma	OO
that	OO
shorted	OO
out	OO
anything	OO
electrical	OO
that	OO
we	OO
put	OO
in	OO
it	.O
we	OU
used	OO
a	OO
different	OO
machine	,O
there	OO
were	OO
other	OO
challenges	,O
and	OO
it	OO
took	OO
years	OO
to	OO
get	OO
it	OO
right	.O
but	OU
when	OO
that	OO
first	OO
sensor	OO
worked	,O
it	OO
was	OO
glorious	.O
and	OU
our	OO
sensors	OO
are	OO
now	OO
10	OO
times	OO
better	OO
than	OO
the	OO
previous	OO
state	OO
of	OO
the	OO
art	OO
and	OO
are	OO
getting	OO
put	OO
into	OO
all	OO
kinds	OO
of	OO
new	OO
telescopes	.O
our	OU
sensors	OO
will	OO
give	OO
us	OO
a	OO
new	OO
way	OO
to	OO
see	OO
the	OO
universe	OO
and	OO
our	OO
place	OO
in	OO
it	.O
so	,U
sensors	OO
done	,O
time	OO
to	OO
build	OO
a	OO
telescope	.O
and	OU
fireball	OU
is	OO
weird	OO
as	OO
far	OO
as	OO
telescopes	OO
go	,O
because	OO
it's	OO
not	OO
in	OO
space	,O
and	OO
it's	OO
not	OO
on	OO
the	OO
ground	.O
instead	,U
it	OO
hangs	OO
on	OO
a	OO
cable	OO
from	OO
a	OO
giant	OO
balloon	OO
and	OO
observes	OO
for	OO
one	OO
night	OO
only	OO
from	OO
130,000	OO
feet	OO
in	OO
the	OO
stratosphere	,O
at	OO
the	OO
very	OO
edge	OO
of	OO
space	.O
this	OU
is	OO
partly	OO
because	OO
the	OO
edge	OO
of	OO
space	OO
is	OO
much	OO
cheaper	OO
than	OO
actual	OO
space	.O
so	OU
building	OO
it	,O
of	OO
course	,O
more	OO
failures:	OO
mirrors	OO
that	OO
failed	,O
scratched	OO
mirrors	OO
that	OO
had	OO
to	OO
be	OO
remade;	OO
cooling	OO
system	OO
failures	,O
an	OO
entire	OO
system	OO
that	OO
had	OO
to	OO
be	OO
remade;	OO
calibration	OO
failures	,O
we	OO
ran	OO
tests	OO
again	OO
and	OO
again	OO
and	OO
again	OO
and	OO
again;	OO
failures	OO
when	OO
you	OO
literally	OO
least	OO
expect	OO
them:	OO
we	OO
had	OO
an	OO
adorable	OO
but	OO
super	OO
angry	OO
baby	OO
falcon	OO
that	OO
landed	OO
on	OO
our	OO
spectrograph	OO
tank	OO
one	OO
day	.O
although	OU
to	OO
be	OO
fair	,O
this	OO
was	OO
the	OO
greatest	OO
day	OO
in	OO
the	OO
history	OO
of	OO
this	OO
project	.O
i	OU
really	OO
loved	OO
that	OO
falcon	.O
but	OU
falcon	OO
damage	OO
fixed	,O
we	OO
got	OO
it	OO
built	OO
for	OO
an	OO
august	OU
2017	OO
launch	OO
attempt	OO
—	OO
and	OO
then	OO
failed	OO
to	OO
launch	,O
due	OO
to	OO
six	OO
weeks	OO
of	OO
continuous	OO
rain	OO
in	OO
the	OO
new	OU
mexico	OU
desert	.O
our	OU
spirits	OO
dampened	,O
we	OO
showed	OO
up	OO
again	,O
august	OU
2018	,O
year	OO
10	.O
and	OU
on	OO
the	OO
morning	OO
of	OO
september	OU
22nd	,O
we	OO
finally	OO
got	OO
the	OO
telescope	OO
launched	.O
i	OU
have	OO
put	OO
so	OO
much	OO
of	OO
myself	OO
—	OO
my	OO
whole	OO
life	OO
—	OO
into	OO
this	OO
project	,O
and	OO
i	,U
like	,O
still	OO
can't	OO
believe	OO
that	OO
that	OO
happened	.O
and	OU
i	OU
have	OO
this	OO
picture	OO
that's	OO
taken	OO
right	OO
around	OO
sunset	OO
on	OO
that	OO
day	OO
of	OO
our	OO
balloon	,O
fireball	OU
hanging	OO
from	OO
it	,O
and	OO
the	OO
nearly	OO
full	OO
moon	.O
and	OU
i	OU
love	OO
this	OO
picture	.O
god	,U
i	OU
love	OO
it	.O
but	OU
i	OU
look	OO
at	OO
it	,O
and	OO
it	OO
makes	OO
me	OO
want	OO
to	OO
cry	,O
because	OO
when	OO
fully	OO
inflated	,O
these	OO
balloons	OO
are	OO
spherical	,O
and	OO
this	OO
one	OO
isn't	.O
it's	OU
shaped	OO
like	OO
a	OO
teardrop	.O
and	OU
that's	OO
because	OO
there	OO
is	OO
a	OO
hole	OO
in	OO
it	.O
sometimes	OU
balloons	OO
fail	,O
too	.O
fireball	OU
crash	OO
landed	OO
in	OO
the	OO
new	OU
mexico	OU
desert	,O
and	OO
we	OO
didn't	OO
get	OO
the	OO
data	OO
that	OO
we	OO
wanted	.O
and	OU
at	OO
the	OO
end	OO
of	OO
that	OO
day	,O
i	OU
thought	OO
to	OO
myself	,O
why	OU
am	OO
i	OU
doing	OO
this	?O
and	OU
i've	OU
thought	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
about	OO
why	OO
since	OO
that	OO
day	.O
and	OU
i've	OU
realized	OO
that	OO
all	OO
of	OO
my	OO
work	OO
has	OO
been	OO
full	OO
of	OO
things	OO
that	OO
break	OO
and	OO
fail	,O
that	OO
we	OO
don't	OO
understand	OO
and	OO
they	OO
fail	,O
that	OO
we	OO
just	OO
get	OO
wrong	OO
the	OO
first	OO
time	,O
and	OO
so	OO
they	OO
fail	.O
i	OU
think	OO
about	OO
the	OO
thousands	OO
of	OO
people	OO
who	OO
built	OO
hubble	OU
and	OO
how	OO
many	OO
failures	OO
they	OO
endured	.O
there	OU
were	OO
countless	OO
failures	,O
heartbreaking	OO
failures	,O
even	OO
when	OO
it	OO
was	OO
in	OO
space	.O
and	OU
none	OO
of	OO
those	OO
failures	OO
were	OO
a	OO
reason	OO
for	OO
them	OO
to	OO
give	OO
up	.O
i	OU
think	OO
about	OO
why	OO
i	OU
love	OO
my	OO
job	.O
i	OU
want	OO
to	OO
know	OO
what	OO
is	OO
happening	OO
in	OO
the	OO
universe	.O
you	OU
all	OO
want	OO
to	OO
know	OO
what's	OO
happening	OO
in	OO
the	OO
universe	,O
too	.O
i	OU
want	OO
to	OO
know	OO
what's	OO
going	OO
on	OO
with	OO
that	OO
hydrogen	.O
and	OU
so	OO
i've	OU
realized	OO
that	OO
discovery	OO
is	OO
mostly	OO
a	OO
process	OO
of	OO
finding	OO
things	OO
that	OO
don't	OO
work	,O
and	OO
failure	OO
is	OO
inevitable	OO
when	OO
you're	OO
pushing	OO
the	OO
limits	OO
of	OO
knowledge	.O
and	OU
that's	OO
what	OO
i	OU
want	OO
to	OO
do	.O
so	OU
i'm	OU
choosing	OO
to	OO
keep	OO
going	.O
and	OU
our	OO
team	OO
is	OO
going	OO
to	OO
do	OO
what	OO
everyone	OO
who	OO
has	OO
ever	OO
built	OO
anything	OO
before	OO
us	OO
has	OO
done:	OO
we're	OO
going	OO
to	OO
try	OO
again	,O
in	OO
2020	.O
and	OU
it	OO
might	OO
feel	OO
like	OO
a	OO
failure	OO
today	OO
—	OO
and	OO
it	OO
really	OO
does	OO
—	OO
but	OO
it's	OO
only	OO
going	OO
to	OO
stay	OO
a	OO
failure	OO
if	OO
i	OU
give	OO
up	.O

you	OO
very	OO
much	.O
the	OU

to	OO
what	OO

the	OO

“manuscripts	OO

this	OU
is	OO
a	OO
strange	OO
and	OO

brain	,O
one	OO
that	OO
gives	OO

to	OO
an	OO
idea	OO
of	OO
a	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
alternative	OO
intelligence	OO
on	OO
this	OO
planet	.O
this	OU
is	OO
a	OO
brain	OO
that	OO
is	OO
formed	OO
in	OO
a	OO
very	OO
strange	OO
body	,O
one	OO
that	OO
has	OO
the	OO
equivalent	OO
of	OO
small	OO
satellite	OO
brains	OO
distributed	OO
throughout	OO
that	OO
body	.O
how	OU
different	OO
is	OO
it	OO
from	OO
the	OO
human	OO
brain	?O
very	OU
different	,O
so	OO
it	OO
seems	,O
so	OO
much	OO
so	OO
that	OO
my	OO
colleagues	OO
and	OO
i	OU
are	OO
struggling	OO
to	OO
understand	OO
how	OO
that	OO
brain	OO
works	.O
but	OU
what	OO
i	OU
can	OO
tell	OO
you	OO
for	OO
certain	OO
is	OO
that	OO
this	OO
brain	OO
is	OO
capable	OO
of	OO
some	OO
amazing	OO
things	.O
so	,U
who	OO
does	OO
this	OO
brain	OO
belong	OO
to	?O
well	,U
join	OO
me	OO
for	OO
a	OO
little	OO
bit	OO
of	OO
diving	OO
into	OO
the	OO
ocean	,O
where	OO
life	OO
began	,O
and	OO
let's	OO
have	OO
a	OO
look	.O
you	OU
may	OO
have	OO
seen	OO
some	OO
of	OO
this	OO
before	,O
but	OO
we're	OO
behind	OO
a	OO
coral	OO
reef	,O
and	OO
there's	OO
this	OO
rock	OO
out	OO
there	,O
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
sand	,O
fishes	OO
swimming	OO
around	.O
and	OU
all	OO
of	OO
a	OO
sudden	OO
this	OO
octopus	OO
appears	,O
and	OO
now	OO
it	OO
flashes	OO
white	,O
inks	OO
in	OO
my	OO
face	OO
and	OO
jets	OO
away	.O
in	OU
slow	OO
motion	OO
reverse	,O
you	OO
see	OO
the	OO
ring	OO
develop	OO
around	OO
the	OO
eye	,O
and	OO
then	OO
the	OO
pattern	OO
develops	OO
in	OO
the	OO
skin	.O
and	OU
now	OO
watch	OO
the	OO
3	OO
d	OU
texture	OO
of	OO
the	OO
skin	OO
change	OO
to	OO
really	OO
create	OO
this	OO
beautiful	,O
3	OO
d	OU
camouflage	.O
so	OU
there	OO
are	OO
25	OO
million	OO
color	OO
organs	OO
called	OO
chromatophores	OO
in	OO
the	OO
skin	,O
and	OO
all	OO
those	OO
bumps	OO
out	OO
there	,O
which	OO
we	OO
call	OO
papillae	,O
and	OO
they're	OO
all	OO
neurally	OO
controlled	OO
and	OO
can	OO
change	OO
instantaneously	.O
i	OU
would	OO
argue	OO
that	OO
dynamic	OO
camouflage	OO
is	OO
a	OO
form	OO
of	OO
intelligence	.O
the	OU
level	OO
of	OO
complexity	OO
of	OO
the	OO
skin	OO
with	OO
fast	OO
precision	OO
change	OO
is	OO
really	OO
quite	OO
astonishing	.O
so	OU
what	OO
can	OO
you	OO
do	OO
with	OO
this	OO
skin	?O
well	,U
let's	OO
think	OO
a	OO
little	OO
bit	OO
about	OO
other	OO
things	OO
besides	OO
camouflage	OO
that	OO
they	OO
can	OO
do	OO
with	OO
their	OO
skin	.O
here	OU
you	OO
see	OO
the	OO
mimic	OO
octopus	OO
and	OO
a	OO
pattern	.O
all	OU
of	OO
a	OO
sudden	,O
it	OO
changes	OO
dramatically	OO
—	OO
that's	OO
signaling	,O
not	OO
camouflage	.O
and	OU
then	OO
it	OO
goes	OO
back	OO
to	OO
the	OO
normal	OO
pattern	.O
then	OU
you	OO
see	OO
the	OO
broadclub	OO
cuttlefish	OO
showing	OO
this	OO
passing	OO
cloud	OO
display	OO
as	OO
it	OO
approaches	OO
a	OO
crab	OO
prey	.O
and	OU
finally	,O
you	OO
see	OO
the	OO
flamboyant	OO
cuttlefish	OO
in	OO
camouflage	OO
and	OO
it	OO
can	OO
shift	OO
instantly	OO
to	OO
this	OO
bright	OO
warning	OO
display	.O
what	OU
we	OO
have	OO
here	OO
is	OO
a	OO
sliding	OO
scale	OO
of	OO
expression	,O
a	OO
continuum	,O
if	OO
you	OO
will	,O
between	OO
conspicuousness	OO
and	OO
camouflage	.O
and	OU
this	OO
requires	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
control	.O
well	,U
guess	OO
what	?O
brains	OU
are	OO
really	OO
good	OO
for	OO
control	.O
the	OU
brain	OO
of	OO
the	OO
octopus	OO
shown	OO
here	OO
has	OO
35	OO
lobes	OO
to	OO
the	OO
brain	,O
80	OO
million	OO
tiny	OO
cells	.O
and	OU
even	OO
though	OO
that's	OO
interesting	,O
what's	OO
really	OO
odd	OO
is	OO
that	OO
the	OO
skin	OO
of	OO
this	OO
animal	OO
has	OO
many	OO
more	OO
neurons	,O
as	OO
illustrated	OO
here	,O
especially	OO
in	OO
the	OO
yellow	.O
there	OU
are	OO
300	OO
million	OO
neurons	OO
in	OO
the	OO
skin	OO
and	OO
only	OO
80	OO
million	OO
in	OO
the	OO
brain	OO
itself	OO
—	OO
four	OO
times	OO
as	OO
many	.O
now	,U
if	OO
you	OO
look	OO
at	OO
that	,O
there's	OO
actually	OO
one	OO
of	OO
those	OO
little	OO
satellite	OO
brains	OO
and	OO
the	OO
equivalent	OO
of	OO
the	OO
spinal	OO
cord	OO
for	OO
each	OO
of	OO
the	OO
eight	OO
arms	.O
this	OU
is	OO
a	OO
very	OO
unusual	OO
way	OO
to	OO
construct	OO
a	OO
nervous	OO
system	OO
in	OO
a	OO
body	.O
well	,U
what	OO
is	OO
that	OO
brain	OO
good	OO
for	?O
that	OU
brain	OO
has	OO
to	OO
outwit	OO
other	OO
big	,O
smart	OO
brains	OO
that	OO
are	OO
trying	OO
to	OO
eat	OO
it	,O
and	OO
that	OO
includes	OO
porpoises	OO
and	OO
seals	OO
and	OO
barracudas	OO
and	OO
sharks	OO
and	OO
even	OO
us	OO
humans	.O
so	OU
decision	OO
making	OO
is	OO
one	OO
of	OO
the	OO
things	OO
that	OO
this	OO
brain	OO
has	OO
to	OO
do	,O
and	OO
it	OO
does	OO
a	OO
very	OO
good	OO
job	OO
of	OO
it	.O
shown	OU
here	,O
you	OO
see	OO
this	OO
octopus	OO
perambulating	OO
along	,O
and	OO
then	OO
it	OO
suddenly	OO
stops	OO
and	OO
creates	OO
that	OO
perfect	OO
camouflage	.O
and	OU
it's	OO
really	OO
marvelous	,O
because	OO
when	OO
these	OO
animals	OO
forage	OO
in	OO
the	OO
wild	,O
they	OO
have	OO
to	OO
make	OO
over	OO
a	OO
hundred	OO
camouflaging	OO
decisions	OO
in	OO
a	OO
two	OO
hour	OO
forage	,O
and	OO
they	OO
do	OO
that	OO
twice	OO
a	OO
day	.O
so	,U
decision	OO
making	.O
they're	OU
also	OO
figuring	OO
out	OO
where	OO
to	OO
go	OO
and	OO
how	OO
to	OO
get	OO
back	OO
home	.O
so	OU
it's	OO
a	OO
decision	OO
making	OO
thing	.O
we	OU
can	OO
test	OO
this	OO
camouflage	,O
like	OO
that	OO
cuttlefish	OO
you	OO
see	OO
behind	OO
me	,O
where	OO
we	OO
pull	OO
the	OO
rug	OO
out	OO
from	OO
under	OO
it	OO
and	OO
give	OO
it	OO
a	OO
checkerboard	,O
and	OO
it	OO
even	OO
uses	OO
that	OO
strange	OO
visual	OO
information	OO
and	OO
does	OO
its	OO
best	OO
to	OO
match	OO
the	OO
pattern	OO
with	OO
a	OO
little	OO
ad	OO
libbing	.O
so	OU
other	OO
cognitive	OO
skills	OO
are	OO
important	,O
too	.O
the	OU
squids	OO
have	OO
a	OO
different	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
smarts	,O
if	OO
you	OO
will	.O
they	OU
have	OO
an	OO
extremely	OO
complex	,O
interesting	OO
sex	OO
life	.O
they	OU
have	OO
fighting	OO
and	OO
flirting	OO
and	OO
courting	OO
and	OO
mate	OO
guarding	OO
and	OO
deception	.O
sound	OU
familiar	?O
and	OU
it's	OO
really	OO
quite	OO
amazing	OO
that	OO
these	OO
animals	OO
have	OO
this	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
intuitive	OO
ability	OO
to	OO
do	OO
these	OO
behaviors	.O
here	OU
you	OO
see	OO
a	OO
male	OO
and	OO
a	OO
female	.O
the	OU
male	,O
on	OO
the	OO
left	,O
has	OO
been	OO
fighting	OO
off	OO
other	OO
males	OO
to	OO
pair	OO
with	OO
the	OO
female	,O
and	OO
now	OO
he's	OO
showing	OO
a	OO
dual	OO
pattern	.O
he	OU
shows	OO
courtship	OO
and	OO
love	OO
on	OO
her	OO
side	,O
fighting	OO
on	OO
the	OO
other	.O
watch	OU
him	OO
when	OO
she	OO
shifts	OO
places	OO
—	OO
and	OO
you	OO
see	OO
that	OO
he	OO
has	OO
fluidly	OO
changed	OO
the	OO
love	OO
courtship	OO
pattern	OO
to	OO
the	OO
side	OO
of	OO
the	OO
female	.O
so	OU
this	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
dual	OO
signaling	OO
simultaneously	OO
with	OO
a	OO
changing	OO
behavioral	OO
context	OO
is	OO
really	OO
extraordinary	.O
it	OU
takes	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
brain	OO
power	.O
now	,U
another	OO
way	OO
to	OO
look	OO
at	OO
this	OO
is	OO
that	,O
hmm	,O
maybe	OO
we	OO
have	OO
50	OO
million	OO
years	OO
of	OO
evidence	OO
for	OO
the	OO
two	OO
faced	OO
male	.O
all	OU
right	,O
let's	OO
move	OO
on	.O
an	OU
octopus	OO
on	OO
a	OO
coral	OO
reef	OO
has	OO
a	OO
tough	OO
job	OO
in	OO
front	OO
it	OO
to	OO
go	OO
to	OO
so	OO
many	OO
places	,O
remember	OO
and	OO
find	OO
its	OO
den	.O
and	OU
they	OO
do	OO
this	OO
extremely	OO
well	.O
they	OU
have	OO
short	OO
and	OO
long	OO
term	OO
memory	,O
they	OO
learn	OO
things	OO
in	OO
three	OO
to	OO
five	OO
trials	OO
—	OO
it's	OO
a	OO
good	OO
brain	.O
and	OU
the	OO
spatial	OO
memory	OO
is	OO
unusually	OO
good	.O
they	OU
will	OO
even	OO
end	OO
their	OO
forage	OO
and	OO
make	OO
a	OO
beeline	OO
all	OO
the	OO
way	OO
back	OO
to	OO
their	OO
den	.O
the	OU
divers	OO
watching	OO
them	OO
are	OO
completely	OO
lost	,O
but	OO
they	OO
can	OO
get	OO
back	,O
so	OO
it's	OO
really	OO
quite	OO
refined	OO
memory	OO
capability	.O
now	,U
in	OO
terms	OO
of	OO
cognitive	OO
skills	,O
look	OO
at	OO
this	OO
sleeping	OO
behavior	OO
in	OO
the	OO
cuttlefish	.O
especially	OU
on	OO
the	OO
right	,O
you	OO
see	OO
the	OO
eye	OO
twitching	.O
this	OU
is	OO
rapid	OO
eye	OO
movement	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
dreaming	OO
that	OO
we	OO
only	OO
thought	OO
mammals	OO
and	OO
birds	OO
did	.O
and	OU
you	OO
see	OO
the	OO
false	OO
color	OO
we	OO
put	OO
in	OO
there	OO
to	OO
see	OO
the	OO
skin	OO
patterning	OO
flashing	,O
and	OO
this	OO
is	OO
what's	OO
happening	OO
a	OO
lot	.O
but	OU
it's	OO
not	OO
normal	OO
awake	OO
behaviors;	OO
it's	OO
all	OO
different	.O
well	,U
dreaming	OO
is	OO
when	OO
you	OO
have	OO
memory	OO
consolidation	,O
and	OO
so	OO
this	OO
is	OO
probably	OO
what's	OO
happening	OO
in	OO
the	OO
cuttlefish	.O
now	,U
another	OO
form	OO
of	OO
memory	OO
that's	OO
really	OO
unusual	OO
is	OO
episodic	OO
like	OO
memory	.O
this	OU
is	OO
something	OO
that	OO
humans	OO
need	OO
four	OO
years	OO
of	OO
brain	OO
development	OO
to	OO
do	OO
to	OO
remember	OO
what	OO
happened	OO
during	OO
a	OO
particular	OO
event	,O
where	OO
it	OO
happened	OO
and	OO
when	OO
it	OO
happened	.O
the	OU
when	OO
part	OO
is	OO
particularly	OO
difficult	,O
and	OO
these	OO
children	OO
can	OO
do	OO
that	.O
but	OU
guess	OO
what	?O
we	OU
find	OO
recently	OO
that	OO
the	OO
wily	OO
cuttlefish	OO
also	OO
has	OO
this	OO
ability	,O
and	OO
in	OO
experiments	OO
last	OO
summer	,O
when	OO
you	OO
present	OO
a	OO
cuttlefish	OO
with	OO
different	OO
foods	OO
at	OO
different	OO
times	,O
they	OO
have	OO
to	OO
match	OO
that	OO
with	OO
where	OO
it	OO
was	OO
exactly	OO
and	OO
when	OO
was	OO
the	OO
last	OO
time	OO
they	OO
saw	OO
it	.O
then	OU
they	OO
have	OO
to	OO
guide	OO
their	OO
foraging	OO
to	OO
the	OO
rate	OO
of	OO
replenishment	OO
of	OO
each	OO
food	OO
type	OO
in	OO
a	OO
different	OO
place	.O
sound	OU
complicated	?O
it's	OU
so	OO
complicated	,O
i	OU
hardly	OO
understood	OO
the	OO
experiment	.O
so	OU
this	OO
is	OO
really	OO
high	OO
level	OO
cognitive	OO
processing	.O
now	,U
speaking	OO
of	OO
brains	OO
and	OO
evolution	OO
at	OO
the	OO
moment	,O
you	OO
look	OO
on	OO
the	OO
right	,O
there's	OO
the	OO
pathway	OO
of	OO
vertebrate	OO
brain	OO
evolution	,O
and	OO
we	OO
all	OO
have	OO
good	OO
brains	.O
i	OU
think	OO
everyone	OO
will	OO
acknowledge	OO
that	.O
but	OU
if	OO
you	OO
look	OO
on	OO
the	OO
left	OO
side	,O
some	OO
of	OO
the	OO
evolutionary	OO
pathway	OO
outlined	OO
here	OO
to	OO
the	OO
octopus	,O
they	OO
have	OO
both	OO
converged	,O
if	OO
you	OO
will	,O
to	OO
complex	OO
behaviors	OO
and	OO
some	OO
form	OO
of	OO
intelligence	.O
the	OU
last	OO
common	OO
denominator	OO
in	OO
these	OO
two	OO
lines	OO
was	OO
600	OO
million	OO
years	OO
ago	,O
and	OO
it	OO
was	OO
a	OO
worm	OO
with	OO
very	OO
few	OO
neurons	,O
so	OO
very	OO
divergent	OO
paths	OO
but	OO
convergence	OO
of	OO
complicated	OO
behavior	.O
here	OU
is	OO
the	OO
fundamental	OO
question:	OO
is	OU
the	OO
brain	OO
structure	OO
of	OO
an	OO
octopus	OO
basically	OO
different	OO
down	OO
to	OO
the	OO
tiniest	OO
level	OO
from	OO
the	OO
vertebrate	OO
line	?O
now	,U
we	OO
don't	OO
know	OO
the	OO
answer	,O
but	OO
if	OO
it	OO
turns	OO
out	OO
to	OO
be	OO
yes	,O
then	OO
we	OO
have	OO
a	OO
different	OO
evolutionary	OO
pathway	OO
to	OO
create	OO
intelligence	OO
on	OO
planet	OO
earth	,U
and	OO
one	OO
might	OO
think	OO
that	OO
the	OO
artificial	OO
intelligence	OO
community	OO
might	OO
be	OO
interested	OO
in	OO
those	OO
mechanisms	.O
well	,U
let's	OO
talk	OO
genetics	OO
just	OO
for	OO
a	OO
moment	.O
we	OU
have	OO
genomes	,O
we	OO
have	OO
dna	,U
dna	OU
is	OO
transcripted	OO
into	OO
rna	,U
rna	OU
translates	OO
that	OO
into	OO
a	OO
protein	,O
and	OO
that's	OO
how	OO
we	OO
come	OO
to	OO
be	.O
well	,U
the	OO
cephalopods	OO
do	OO
it	OO
differently	.O
they	OU
have	OO
big	OO
genomes	,O
they	OO
have	OO
dna	,U
they	OO
transcript	OO
it	OO
into	OO
rna	,U
but	OO
now	OO
something	OO
dramatically	OO
different	OO
happens	.O
they	OU
edit	OO
that	OO
rna	OU
at	OO
an	OO
astronomical	OO
weird	OO
rate	,O
a	OO
hundredfold	OO
more	OO
than	OO
we	OO
as	OO
humans	OO
or	OO
other	OO
animals	OO
do	.O
and	OU
it	OO
produces	OO
scores	OO
of	OO
proteins	.O
and	OU
guess	OO
where	OO
most	OO
of	OO
them	OO
are	OO
for	?O
the	OU
nervous	OO
system	.O
so	OU
perhaps	OO
this	OO
is	OO
an	OO
unorthodox	OO
way	OO
for	OO
an	OO
animal	OO
to	OO
evolve	OO
behavioral	OO
plasticity	.O
this	OU
is	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
conjecture	,O
but	OO
it's	OO
food	OO
for	OO
thought	.O
now	,U
i'd	OU
like	OO
to	OO
share	OO
with	OO
you	OO
for	OO
a	OO
moment	OO
my	OO
experience	,O
and	OO
using	OO
my	OO
smarts	OO
and	OO
that	OO
of	OO
my	OO
colleagues	,O
to	OO
try	OO
and	OO
get	OO
this	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
information	.O
we're	OU
diving	,O
we	OO
can't	OO
stay	OO
underwater	OO
forever	OO
because	OO
we	OO
can't	OO
breathe	OO
it	,O
so	OO
we	OO
have	OO
to	OO
be	OO
efficient	OO
in	OO
what	OO
we	OO
do	.O
the	OU
total	OO
sensory	OO
immersion	OO
into	OO
that	OO
world	OO
is	OO
what	OO
helps	OO
us	OO
understand	OO
what	OO
these	OO
animals	OO
are	OO
really	OO
doing	,O
and	OO
i	OU
have	OO
to	OO
tell	OO
you	OO
that	OO
it's	OO
really	OO
an	OO
amazing	OO
experience	OO
to	OO
be	OO
down	OO
there	OO
and	OO
having	OO
this	OO
communication	OO
with	OO
an	OO
octopus	OO
and	OO
a	OO
diver	OO
when	OO
you	OO
really	OO
begin	OO
to	OO
understand	OO
that	OO
this	OO
is	OO
a	OO
thinking	,O
cogitating	,O
curious	OO
animal	.O
and	OU
this	OO
is	OO
the	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
thing	OO
that	OO
really	OO
inspires	OO
me	OO
endlessly	.O
let's	OU
go	OO
back	OO
to	OO
that	OO
smart	OO
skin	OO
for	OO
a	OO
few	OO
moments	.O
here's	OU
a	OO
squid	OO
and	OO
a	OO
camouflage	OO
pattern	.O
we	OU
zoom	OO
down	OO
and	OO
we	OO
see	OO
there's	OO
beautiful	OO
pigments	OO
and	OO
reflectors	.O
there	OU
are	OO
the	OO
chromatophores	OO
opening	OO
and	OO
closing	OO
very	OO
quickly	.O
and	OU
then	,O
in	OO
the	OO
next	OO
layer	OO
of	OO
skin	,O
it's	OO
quite	OO
interesting	.O
the	OU
chromatophores	OO
are	OO
closed	,O
and	OO
you	OO
see	OO
this	OO
magical	OO
iridescence	OO
just	OO
come	OO
out	OO
of	OO
the	OO
skin	.O
this	OU
is	OO
also	OO
neurally	OO
controlled	,O
so	OO
it's	OO
the	OO
combination	OO
of	OO
the	OO
two	,O
as	OO
seen	OO
here	OO
in	OO
the	OO
high	OO
resolution	OO
skin	OO
of	OO
the	OO
cuttlefish	,O
where	OO
you	OO
get	OO
this	OO
beautiful	OO
pigmentary	OO
structural	OO
coloration	OO
and	OO
even	OO
the	OO
faint	OO
blushing	OO
that	OO
is	OO
so	OO
beautiful	.O
well	,U
how	OO
can	OO
we	OO
make	OO
use	OO
of	OO
some	OO
of	OO
this	OO
information	?O
i	OU
talked	OO
about	OO
those	OO
skin	OO
bumps	,O
the	OO
papillae	.O
here's	OU
the	OO
giant	OO
australian	OU
cuttlefish	.O
it's	OU
got	OO
smooth	OO
skin	OO
and	OO
a	OO
conspicuous	OO
pattern	.O
i	OU
took	OO
five	OO
pictures	OO
in	OO
a	OO
row	OO
one	OO
second	OO
apart	,O
and	OO
just	OO
watch	OO
this	OO
animal	OO
morph	OO
—	OO
one	,O
two	,O
three	,O
four	,O
five	OO
—	OO
and	OO
now	OO
i'm	OU
a	OO
seaweed	.O
and	OU
then	OO
we	OO
can	OO
come	OO
right	OO
back	OO
out	OO
of	OO
it	OO
to	OO
see	OO
the	OO
smooth	OO
skin	OO
and	OO
the	OO
conspicuousness	.O
so	OU
this	OO
is	OO
really	OO
marvelous	,O
morphing	OO
skin	.O
you	OU
can	OO
see	OO
it	OO
in	OO
more	OO
detail	OO
here	.O
periscope	OU
up	,O
and	OO
you've	OO
got	OO
those	OO
beautiful	OO
papillae	.O
and	OU
then	OO
we	OO
look	OO
in	OO
a	OO
little	OO
more	OO
detail	,O
you	OO
can	OO
see	OO
the	OO
individual	OO
papillae	OO
come	OO
up	,O
and	OO
there	OO
are	OO
little	OO
ridges	OO
on	OO
there	,O
so	OO
it's	OO
a	OO
papilla	OO
on	OO
papilla	OO
and	OO
so	OO
forth	.O
every	OU
individual	OO
species	OO
out	OO
there	OO
has	OO
more	OO
than	OO
a	OO
dozen	OO
shapes	OO
and	OO
sizes	OO
of	OO
those	OO
bumps	OO
to	OO
create	OO
fine	OO
tuned	,O
neurally	OO
controlled	OO
camouflage	.O
so	OU
now	,O
my	OO
colleagues	OO
at	OO
cornell	,U
engineers	,O
watched	OO
our	OO
work	OO
and	OO
said	,O
we	OU
think	OO
we	OO
can	OO
make	OO
some	OO
of	OO
those	.O
because	OU
in	OO
industry	OO
and	OO
society	,O
this	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
soft	OO
materials	OO
under	OO
control	OO
of	OO
shape	OO
are	OO
really	OO
very	OO
rare	.O
and	OU
they	OO
went	OO
ahead	,O
worked	OO
with	OO
us	OO
and	OO
made	OO
the	OO
first	OO
samples	OO
of	OO
artificial	OO
papillae	,O
soft	OO
materials	,O
shown	OO
here	.O
and	OU
you	OO
see	OO
them	OO
blown	OO
up	OO
into	OO
different	OO
shapes	,O
and	OU
then	OO
you	OO
can	OO
press	OO
your	OO
finger	OO
on	OO
them	OO
to	OO
see	OO
that	OO
they're	OO
a	OO
little	OO
bit	OO
malleable	OO
as	OO
they	OO
are	.O
and	OU
so	OO
this	OO
is	OO
an	OO
example	OO
of	OO
how	OO
that	OO
might	OO
work	.O
well	,U
i	OU
want	OO
to	OO
segue	OO
from	OO
this	OO
into	OO
the	OO
color	OO
of	OO
fabrics	,O
and	OO
i	OU
imagine	OO
that	OO
could	OO
have	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
applications	OO
as	OO
well	.O
just	OU
look	OO
at	OO
this	OO
kaleidoscope	OO
of	OO
color	OO
of	OO
dynamically	OO
controlled	OO
pigments	OO
and	OO
reflectors	OO
that	OO
we	OO
see	OO
in	OO
the	OO
cephalopods	.O
we	OU
know	OO
enough	OO
about	OO
the	OO
mechanics	OO
of	OO
how	OO
they	OO
work	OO
that	OO
we	OO
can	OO
begin	OO
to	OO
translate	OO
this	OO
not	OO
only	OO
into	OO
fabrics	OO
but	OO
perhaps	OO
even	OO
into	OO
changeable	OO
cosmetics	.O
and	OU
moreover	,O
there's	OO
been	OO
the	OO
recent	OO
discovery	OO
of	OO
light	OO
sensing	OO
molecules	OO
in	OO
the	OO
skin	OO
of	OO
octopus	OO
which	OO
may	OO
pave	OO
the	OO
way	OO
to	,O
eventually	,O
smart	OO
materials	OO
that	OO
sense	OO
and	OO
respond	OO
on	OO
their	OO
own	.O
well	,U
this	OO
form	OO
of	OO
biotechnology	,O
or	OO
biomimicry	,O
if	OO
you	OO
will	,O
could	OO
change	OO
the	OO
way	OO
we	OO
look	OO
at	OO
the	OO
world	OO
even	OO
above	OO
water	.O
take	,U
for	OO
example	,O
artificial	OO
intelligence	OO
that	OO
might	OO
be	OO
inspired	OO
by	OO
the	OO
body	OO

and	OO
behavior	OO
of	OO
the	OO

or	OO
the	OO
smart	OO
skin	OO
of	OO
a	OO
cuttlefish	OO
translated	OO
into	OO

well	,U
how	OO
do	OO
we	OO
get	OO
there	?O
maybe	OU
all	OO
we	OO
have	OO
to	OO
do	OO
is	OO
to	OO
begin	OO
to	OO

a	OO

so	,U
i	OU
thought	OO
i'd	OU
tell	OO
you	OO
just	OO
a	OO

about	OO
the	OO

my	OU

but	OO
what	OO
i	OU
want	OO
to	OO
talk	OO
today	OO
is	OO
primarily	OO
light	OO
and	OO
its	OO
impact	OO
on	OO
health	.O
so	,U
of	OO
course	,O
we	OO
live	OO
on	OO
this	OO
planet	OO
that	OO
spins	OO
around	OO
its	OO

as	OO
it's	OO
orbiting	OO
the	OO

as	OU
a	OO
consequence	OO
of	OO
that	,O
one	OO
of	OO
the	OO
basic	OO
facts	OO
of	OO
life	OO
on	OO
earth	OU
is	OO
that	OO
you're	OO
exposed	OO
to	OO
light	OO
dark	OO
cycles	OO
every	OO
single	OO
day	.O
here	OU
you	OO
see	OO
the	OO
side	OO
of	OO
the	OO
earth	OU
that's	OO
facing	OO
the	OO
sun	,U
is	OO
light	,O
and	OO
the	OO
other	OO
one	OO
is	OO
dark	,O
and	OO
actually	,O
i	OU
think	OO
we	OO
have	OO
so	OO
much	OO
light	OO
here	OO
that	OO
the	OO
dark	OO
side	OO
is	OO
kind	OO
of	OO

out	.O

if	OO
the	OO

a	OO

you	OO

that	OO

all	OO
over	OO
the	OO

at	OO

where	OO
there's	OO

and	OU
that's	OO
maybe	OO
a	OO

from	OO

a	OO

from	OO

i	OU
think	OO
that	OO
this	OO

a	OO
really	OO
stunning	OO
image	.O
it's	OU
stunningly	OO
beautiful	,O
but	OO
it's	OO
also	OO
stunning	OO
to	OO
think	OO
about	OO
the	OO
amount	OO
of	OO
light	OO
that	OO
we're	OO
enveloping	OO
the	OO
earth	OU
on	,O

at	OO
the	OO

when	,O
for	OO
pretty	OO
much	OO
all	OO
of	OO
our	OO
evolutionary	OO
history	,O
the	OO
earth	OU
has	OO
been	OO
dark	.O
there's	OU
this	OO
funny	OO
story	OO
that	OO
i	OU
don't	OO
know	OO
if	OO
it's	OO
true	,O
but	OO
i	OU
like	OO
it	,O
i	OU
think	OO
it's	OO
a	OO
good	OO
story	,O
where	OO
in	OO
1994	,O
in	OO
la	,U
police	OO
started	OO
getting	OO
reports	OO
of	OO
people	OO
seeing	OO
a	OO
strange	OO
white	OO
cloud	OO
in	OO
the	OO
sky	,O
and	OO
they	OO
didn't	OO
know	OO
what	OO
this	OO
was	.O
they	OU
wondered	OO
if	OO
they	OO
should	OO
be	OO
worried	.O
it	OU
turned	OO
out	OO
la	OU
had	OO
just	OO
suffered	OO
a	OO
major	OO
earthquake	OO
which	OO
resulted	OO
in	OO
citywide	OO
blackouts	.O
so	,U
many	OO
people	OO
for	OO
the	OO
first	OO
time	OO
in	OO
many	OO
years	,O
or	OO
perhaps	OO
the	OO
first	OO
time	OO
in	OO
their	OO
lives	,O
had	OO
an	OO
unobstructed	OO
view	OO
of	OO
the	OO
night	OO
sky	.O
in	OU
fact	,O
what	OO
they	OO
were	OO
seeing	OO
was	OO
not	OO
a	OO
trail	OO
from	OO
some	OO
alien	OO
spaceship	,O
but	OO
it	OO
was	OO
a	OO
glimpse	OO
of	OO
our	OO
own	OO
home	OO
galaxy	,O
the	OO
milky	OU
way	.U
this	OU
may	OO
sound	OO
quite	OO
incredible	OO
to	OO
you	OO
until	OO
i	OU
show	OO
you	OO
this	OO
next	OO
picture	.O
here's	OU
a	OO
picture	OO
that	OO
this	OO
guy	,O
todd	OU
carlson	,U
from	OO
canada	,U
took	OO
of	OO
his	OO
house	,O
a	OO
fairly	OO
typical	OO
looking	OO
house	,O
a	OO
typical	OO
looking	OO
sky	,O
at	OO
least	OO
for	OO
those	OO
of	OO
us	OO
living	OO
in	OO
boston	,U
or	OO
surrounding	OO
areas	.O
you	OU
can	OO
even	OO
make	OO
out	OO
some	OO
stars	OO
in	OO
the	OO
sky	.O
in	OU
2003	,O
there	OO
was	OO
a	OO
blackout	OO
that	OO
affected	OO
large	OO
parts	OO
of	OO
the	OO
united	OU
states	OU
and	OO
canada	,U
and	OO
todd	OU
carlson	OU
lost	OO
his	OO
electricity	,O
and	OO
he	OO
was	OO
smart	OO
enough	OO
to	OO
take	OO
a	OO
picture	OO
of	OO
his	OO
house	OO
at	OO
that	OO
time	,O
and	OO
this	OO
is	OO
what	OO
it	OO
looked	OO
like	.O
and	OU
again	,O
here	OO
you	OO
can	OO
see	OO
this	OO
strange	,O
white	OO
cloud	OO
in	OO
the	OO
sky	OO
which	OO
is	OO
the	OO
milky	OU
way	.U
the	OU
lights	OO
that	OO
we	OO
are	OO
producing	OO
as	OO
humans	,O
due	OO
to	OO
our	OO
ingenuity	,O
are	OO
wiping	OO
out	,O
basically	,O
our	OO
view	OO
of	OO
these	OO
millions	OO
of	OO
stars	OO
in	OO
the	OO
sky	.O
so	,U
if	OO
we	OO
think	OO
about	OO
that	,O
this	OO
is	OO
certainly	OO
a	OO
shame	,O
because	OO
there	OO
are	OO
a	OO
few	OO
things	OO
that	OO
are	OO
more	OO
magnificent	OO
than	OO
a	OO
view	OO
of	OO
the	OO
night	OO
sky	.O
but	OU
we	OO
should	OO
also	OO
think	OO
about	OO
what	OO
is	OO
this	OO
doing	OO
to	OO
our	OO
health	OO
if	OO
we're	OO
flooding	OO
ourselves	OO
with	OO
this	OO
amount	OO
of	OO
light	OO
pollution	?O
so	OU
i	OU
want	OO
to	OO
i	OU
tell	OO
you	OO
that	OO
all	OO
throughout	OO
your	OO
bodies	,O
in	OO
all	OO
of	OO
your	OO
organs	,O
you	OO
have	OO
biological	OO
clocks	OO
that	OO
keep	OO
you	OO
in	OO
sync	OO
with	OO
the	OO
light	OO
dark	OO
cycles	OO
of	OO
your	OO
environment	OO
that	OO
result	OO
from	OO
the	OO
earth's	OU
rotation	.O
and	OU
in	OO
your	OO
heads	OO
you	OO
have	OO
a	OO
master	OO
clock	,O
a	OO
main	OO
clock	OO
that	OO
synchronizes	OO
all	OO
of	OO
these	OO
other	OO
clocks	OO
in	OO
your	OO
bodies	.O
the	OU
way	OO
that	OO
this	OO
works	OO
is	OO
that	OO
light	OO
travels	OO
from	OO
a	OO
source	,O
such	OO
as	OO
the	OO
sun	,U
or	OO
an	OO
artificial	OO
light	OO
source	,O
through	OO
your	OO
eyes	,O
and	OO
that	OO
light	OO
information	OO
is	OO
then	OO
conveyed	OO
to	OO
the	OO
brain	,O
to	OO
the	OO
master	OO
clock	OO
that's	OO
in	OO
a	OO
part	OO
of	OO
your	OO
brain	OO
called	OO
the	OO
suprachiasmatic	OO
nucleus	,O
or	OO
the	OO
scn	.U
so	OU
in	OO
your	OO
eyes	OO
you	OO
of	OO
course	OO
have	OO
cells	OO
that	OO
help	OO
you	OO
see	OO
the	OO
stars	,O
that	OO
help	OO
you	OO
form	OO
visible	OO
imagery	.O
but	OU
you	OO
also	OO
have	OO
cells	OO
that	OO
are	OO
not	OO
a	OO
part	OO
of	OO
the	OO
visual	OO
forming	OO
pathways	,O
but	OO
rather	OO
their	OO
role	OO
is	OO
to	OO
capture	OO
light	OO
information	OO
and	OO
basically	OO
convey	OO
it	OO
to	OO
the	OO
brain	,O
to	OO
tell	OO
the	OO
brain	OO
what	OO
time	OO
of	OO
day	OO
it	OO
is	.O
so	,U
how	OO
can	OO
i	OU
convince	OO
you	OO
that	OO
you	OO
have	OO
this	OO
clock	?O
well	,U
if	OO
i	OU
closed	OO
you	OO
in	OO
a	OO
dark	OO
room	OO
where	OO
you	OO
would	OO
have	OO
no	OO
external	OO
source	OO
of	OO
light	,O
no	OO
alarm	OO
clocks	,O
no	OO
clocks	OO
of	OO
any	OO
kind	,O
you	OO
would	OO
still	OO
retain	OO
rhythmic	OO
sleep	OO
and	OO
wake	OO
patterns	OO
at	OO
least	OO
for	OO
a	OO
little	OO
while	,O
because	OO
your	OO
clock	OO
was	OO
previously	OO
trained	OO
to	OO
light	OO
dark	OO
cycles	OO
and	OO
one	OO
of	OO
the	OO
main	OO
functions	OO
of	OO
the	OO
clock	OO
is	OO
to	OO
regulate	OO
behavioral	OO
rhythmicity	.O
this	,U
of	OO
course	,O
is	OO
not	OO
an	OO
experiment	OO
that	OO
many	OO
of	OO
you	OO
would	OO
be	OO
willing	OO
to	OO
subject	OO
yourselves	OO
to	,O
but	,O
fortunately	,O
there's	OO
an	OO
experiment	OO
that	OO
most	OO
of	OO
us	OO
have	OO
participated	OO
in	,O
which	OO
is	OO
traveling	OO
across	OO
time	OO
zones	.O
so	,U
i	OU
like	OO
this	OO
quote	OO
that	OO
says	,O
when	OU
you	OO
travel	OO
from	OO
america	OU
to	OO
europe	,U
your	OO
soul	OO
takes	OO
about	OO
three	OO
days	OO
longer	OO
to	OO
get	OO
there	.O
and	OU
i	OU
know	OO
this	OO
is	OO
certainly	OO
true	OO
when	OO
i	OU
travel	OO
from	OO
here	OO
to	OO
serbia	,U
my	OO
home	OO
country	.O
it	OU
does	OO
take	OO
me	OO
several	OO
days	OO
basically	,O
to	OO
feel	OO
normal	,O
to	OO
feel	OO
aligned	OO
with	OO
the	OO
population	OO
that's	OO
living	OO
there	.O
and	OU
this	OO
is	OO
because	OO
your	OO
clock	OO
takes	OO
a	OO
few	OO
days	OO
to	OO
get	OO
realigned	OO
with	OO
this	OO
new	OO
schedule	.O
and	,U
if	OO
you	OO
think	OO
about	OO
this	,O
this	OO
makes	OO
sense	,O
right	?O
so	,U
for	OO
pretty	OO
much	OO
all	OO
of	OO
our	OO
history	,O
except	OO
for	OO
a	OO
blink	OO
of	OO
an	OO
eye	,O
in	OO
our	OO
evolutionary	OO
history	,O
nobody	OO
had	OO
a	OO
way	OO
of	OO
hopping	OO
from	OO
one	OO
continent	OO
to	OO
the	OO
other	OO
in	OO
a	OO
matter	OO
of	OO
hours	.O
we're	OU
changing	OO
time	OO
zones	OO
so	OO
quickly	,O
and	OO
in	OO
this	OO
case	,O
nature's	OO
not	OO
really	OO
keeping	OO
up	OO
with	OO
what	OO
we	OO
are	OO
capable	OO
of	OO
doing	.O
so	,U
what	OO
is	OO
this	OO
clock	?O
and	OU
why	OO
is	OO
it	OO
important	OO
to	OO
think	OO
about	OO
light	?O
the	OU
clock	OO
is	OO
a	OO
molecular	OO
oscillator	,O
the	OO
details	OO
here	OO
are	OO
not	OO
important	OO
at	OO
all	,O
i	OU
don't	OO
want	OO
you	OO
to	OO
look	OO
at	OO
the	OO
names	OO
of	OO
these	OO
things	OO
on	OO
the	OO
board	,O
but	OO
i	OU
want	OO
to	OO
point	OO
out	OO
that	OO
the	OO
clock	OO
is	OO
essentially	OO
the	OO
same	OO
in	OO
animals	OO
such	OO
as	OO
fruit	OO
flies	,O
which	OO
my	OO
lab	OO
uses	OO
in	OO
our	OO
studies	,O
and	OO
in	OO
mammals	OO
like	OO
mice	OO
or	OO
humans	.O
and	OU
the	OO
first	OO
glimpses	OO
of	OO
the	OO
clock	,O
the	OO
components	OO
of	OO
the	OO
clock	,O
and	OO
the	OO
way	OO
that	OO
it	OO
ticks	OO
were	OO
gained	OO
in	OO
the	OO
fly	,O
actually	.O
what	OU
i	OU
want	OO
to	OO
stress	OO
here	OO
is	OO
that	OO
the	OO
clock	OO
is	OO
tuned	OO
by	OO
light	.O
some	OU
of	OO
the	OO
components	OO
of	OO
this	OO
clock	OO
are	OO
actually	OO
degraded	,O
directly	OO
degraded	OO
by	OO
light	.O
so	,U
that	OO
results	OO
in	OO
the	OO
state	OO
of	OO
the	OO
clock	OO
essentially	OO
oscillating	OO
throughout	OO
the	OO
day	OO
and	OO
night	.O
you	OU
can	OO
imagine	OO
if	OO
the	OO
composition	OO
of	OO
the	OO
clock	,O
if	OO
some	OO
of	OO
the	OO
components	OO
are	OO
degraded	,O
the	OO
composition	OO
of	OO
the	OO
clock	OO
will	OO
change	OO
between	OO
day	OO
and	OO
night	.O
and	OU
then	OO
the	OO
outputs	OO
of	OO
the	OO
clock	OO
between	OO
day	OO
and	OO
night	OO
will	OO
be	OO
different	.O
so	,U
for	OO
instance	,O
during	OO
the	OO
day	,O
the	OO
state	OO
of	OO
your	OO
clock	OO
is	OO
such	OO
that	OO
you	OO
are	OO
suppressing	OO
production	OO
of	OO
melatonin	,O
which	OO
is	OO
the	OO
hormone	OO
that	OO
helps	OO
you	OO
fall	OO
asleep	,O
but	OO
also	OO
has	OO
other	OO
functions	,O
such	OO
as	OO
anti	OO
cancer	OO
and	OO
antioxidant	OO
properties	.O
so	OU
light	.O
let's	OU
talk	OO
about	OO
blue	OO
light	OO
a	OO
little	OO
bit	.O
when	OU
you're	OO
outside	OO
during	OO
the	OO
day	,O
you're	,O
of	OO
course	,O
exposed	OO
to	OO
sunlight	OO
which	OO
consists	OO
of	OO
different	OO
wavelengths	OO
of	OO
light	.O
but	OU
the	OO
one	OO
that's	OO
particularly	OO
important	OO
is	OO
blue	OO
light	,O
because	OO
of	OO
its	OO
effect	OO
on	OO
our	OO
clock	.O
blue	OU
light	OO
also	OO
directly	OO
elevates	OO
your	OO
mood	,O
it	OO
boosts	OO
your	OO
attention	OO
and	OO
your	OO
alertness	.O
so	OU
blue	OO
light	OO
during	OO
the	OO
day	OO
is	OO
very	,O
very	OO
good	,O
and	OO
i'd	OU
say	OO
that	OO
most	OO
of	OO
us	OO
don't	OO
spend	OO
enough	OO
time	OO
in	OO
a	OO
bright	OO
light	OO
outside	.O
you	OU
should	OO
be	OO
for	OO
30	OO
to	OO
60	OO
minutes	OO
outside	OO
in	OO
bright	OO
light	,O
so	OO
put	OO
some	OO
sunscreen	OO
on	OO
and	OO
go	OO
outside	.O
the	OU
flip	OO
side	OO
of	OO
this	OO
is	OO
that	OO
when	OO
you	OO
come	OO
home	OO
at	OO
night	OO
i	OU
would	OO
dare	OO
guess	OO
that	OO
pretty	OO
much	OO
none	OO
of	OO
us	OO
spend	OO
the	OO
rest	OO
of	OO
the	OO
day	OO
when	OO
we	OO
come	OO
home	,O
in	OO
darkness	,O
and	OO
we're	OO
not	OO
in	OO
tune	OO
with	OO
the	OO
natural	OO
light	OO
and	OO
dark	OO
cycles	,O
right	?O
so	,U
what	OO
we	OO
do	OO
normally	OO
is	OO
we	OO
use	OO
our	OO
computers	,O
smartphones	,O
tablets;	OO
we	OO
are	OO
in	OO
rooms	OO
that	OO
have	OO
high	OO
amounts	OO
of	OO
led	OU
light	.O
and	,U
in	OO
particular	,O
what's	OO
really	OO
bad	OO
is	OO
that	OO
these	OO
devices	OO
are	OO
very	,O
very	OO
rich	OO
in	OO
blue	OO
light	.O
so	,U
what	OO
you're	OO
doing	,O
every	OO
evening	,O
when	OO
you're	OO
using	OO
these	OO
devices	OO
is	OO
you're	OO
essentially	OO
tricking	OO
your	OO
clock	OO
into	OO
thinking	OO
that	OO
it's	OO
still	OO
day	.O
and	OU
since	OO
the	OO
clock	OO
during	OO
day	OO
and	OO
blue	OO
light	OO
suppress	OO
melatonin	OO
production	,O
you're	OO
essentially	OO
doing	OO
that	OO
at	OO
night	.O
now	,U
i'm	OU
not	OO
naive	OO
enough	OO
to	OO
suggest	OO
you	OO
never	OO
use	OO
your	OO
computer	OO
at	OO
night	,O
i	OU
know	OO
i	OU
wouldn't	OO
abide	OO
by	OO
that	.O
but	OU
one	OO
thing	OO
that	OO
you	OO
can	OO
do	,O
is	OO
you	OO
can	OO
turn	OO
the	OO
brightness	OO
of	OO
your	OO
screen	OO
in	OO
the	OO
evening	,O
you	OO
can	OO
download	OO
programs	OO
that	OO
filter	OO
some	OO
of	OO
the	OO
blue	OO
light	OO
or	OO
you	OO
can	OO
use	OO
glasses	OO
that	OO
block	OO
some	OO
of	OO
the	OO
blue	OO
light	.O
i	OU
have	OO
a	OO
little	OO
bit	OO
of	OO
news	OO
for	OO
you	OO
that	OO
maybe	OO
you'll	OO
perceive	OO
as	OO
bad	,O
but	OO
i	OU
think	OO
it's	OO
actually	OO
very	OO
good	,O
which	OO
is	OO
that	OO
you	OO
are	OO
very	OO
much	OO
like	OO
these	OO
guys	.O
so	,U
this	OO
is	OO
a	OO
close	OO
up	OO
of	OO
a	OO
fruit	OO
fly	,O
and	OO
you	OO
may	OO
not	OO
like	OO
if	OO
i	OU
tell	OO
you	OO
that	OO
you	OO
are	OO
like	OO
these	OO
guys	.O
but	OU
think	OO
about	OO
it	OO
for	OO
a	OO
second	,O
this	OO
is	OO
very	OO
good	OO
for	OO
us	OO
because	OO
now	OO
we	OO
can	OO
use	OO
these	OO
animals	OO
as	OO
a	OO
model	OO
system	OO
to	OO
understand	OO
more	OO
about	OO
sleep	OO
biology	,O
and	OO
how	OO
light	OO
influences	OO
our	OO
clock	OO
and	OO
our	OO
health	,O
and	OO
this	OO
is	OO
what	OO
my	OO
lab	OO
is	OO
doing	.O
so	,U
they	OO
sleep	OO
just	OO
like	OO
we	OO
do	,O
they	OO
sleep	OO
at	OO
night	.O
if	OU
we	OO
deprive	OO
them	OO
of	OO
sleep	,O
then	OO
they	OO
crash	OO
the	OO
next	OO
day	OO
during	OO
the	OO
time	OO
they	OO
would	OO
normally	OO
be	OO
active	.O
if	OU
we	OO
deprive	OO
them	OO
of	OO
sleep	OO
for	OO
a	OO
long	OO
time	,O
they	OO
die;	OO
so	OO
sleep	OO
is	OO
very	OO
important	OO
for	OO
them	.O
the	OU
same	OO
genes	OO
that	OO
regulate	OO
sleep	OO
in	OO
humans	OO
regulate	OO
sleep	OO
in	OO
flies	.O
and	OU
when	OO
they're	OO
asleep	OO
they're	OO
disconnected	,O
at	OO
least	OO
to	OO
a	OO
large	OO
degree	,O
disconnected	OO
from	OO
their	OO
environment	,O
just	OO
like	OO
we	OO
are	.O
so	,U
if	OO
these	OO
guys	OO
are	OO
sleeping	,O
you	OO
need	OO
a	OO
stronger	OO
intensity	OO
stimulus	OO
to	OO
get	OO
them	OO
to	OO
react	OO
than	OO
when	OO
they're	OO
awake	.O
so	OU
same	OO
thing	OO
that	OO
happens	OO
to	OO
you	OO
of	OO
course	,O
when	OO
you're	OO
asleep	.O
two	OU
people	OO
in	OO
my	OO
lab:	OO
a	OO
postdoc	,O
iris	OU
titos	OU
vivancos	OU
and	OO
a	OO
phd	OU
student	,O
michelle	OU
frank	,U
are	OO
asking	OO
exactly	OO
what	OO
is	OO
this	OO
barrier	OO
that's	OO
established	OO
in	OO
the	OO
brain	OO
that	OO
prevents	OO
sensor	OO
information	OO
from	OO
coming	OO
through	OO
during	OO
sleep	?O
how	OU
can	OO
your	OO
same	OO
physical	OO
brain	OO
exist	OO
in	OO
two	OO
fundamentally	OO
different	OO
states	?O
so	OU
now	OO
we're	OO
engaged	,O
for	OO
instance	,O
here	OO
i'm	OU
speaking	OO
to	OO
you	,O
i'm	OU
engaged	,O
i'm	OU
aware	OO
of	OO
you	,O
of	OO
my	OO
surroundings	,O
i'm	OU
aware	OO
of	OO
my	OO
internal	OO
state;	OO
but	OO
tonight	OO
when	OO
i	OU
go	OO
to	OO
sleep	,O
i	OU
will	OO
be	OO
in	OO
a	OO
completely	OO
different	OO
state	.O
and	OU
another	OO
thing	OO
that	OO
we're	OO
asking	OO
which	OO
is	OO
relevant	OO
to	OO
what	OO
i	OU
talked	OO
about	,O
to	OO
light	,O
is	OO
how	OO
light	OO
coming	OO
through	OO
the	OO
eye	OO
is	OO
regulating	OO
sleep	OO
and	OO
wake	OO
patterns	?O
a	OU
phd	OU
student	OO
in	OO
my	OO
lab	,O
bryan	OU
song	,U
is	OO
asking	OO
exactly	OO
this	,O
what	OU
bryan	OU
can	OO
do	OO
is	,O
he	OO
can—	OO
you	OO
can	OO
see	OO
that	OO
flies	OO
have	OO
these	OO
big	OO
eyes	OO
that	OO
take	OO
up	OO
a	OO
large	OO
part	OO
of	OO
their	OO
head	.O
what	OU
bryan	OU
can	OO
do	OO
is	OO
he	OO
can	OO
actually	OO
trick	OO
the	OO
cells	OO
in	OO
the	OO
eye	OO
into	OO
thinking	OO
they're	OO
seeing	OO
light	,O
even	OO
when	OO
they're	OO
not	.O
and	OU
this	OO
results	OO
in	OO
animals	OO
having	OO
trouble	OO
falling	OO
asleep	,O
so	OO
it	OO
takes	OO
them	OO
about	OO
an	OO
hour	OO
and	OO
a	OO
half	OO
longer	OO
to	OO
fall	OO
asleep	.O
you	OU
can	OO
imagine	OO
that	OO
now	OO
we	OO
can	OO
use	OO
this	OO
as	OO
a	OO
model	OO
organism	OO
to	OO
understand	OO
what	OO
it	OO
is	OO
that	OO
happens	OO
in	OO
the	OO
brain	OO
when	OO
it's	OO
getting	OO
light	OO
information	OO
and	OO
how	OO
this	OO
is	OO
interfacing	OO
with	OO
sleep	OO
and	OO
wake	OO
centers	OO
in	OO
the	OO
brain	.O
and	OU
so	OO
one	OO
final	OO
thing	OO
i	OU
want	OO
to	OO
tell	OO
you	OO
is	OO
well	,O
first	OO
i	OU
want	OO
you	OO
to	OO
think	OO
again	OO
for	OO
a	OO
moment	OO
about	OO
our	OO
evolutionary	OO
history	.O
we	OU
evolved	OO
without	OO
alarm	OO
clocks	,O
without	OO
any	OO
external	OO
source	OO
of	OO
information	OO
of	OO
the	OO
time	OO
of	OO
day	,O
and	OO
we've	OO
developed	OO
this	OO
way	OO
that	OO
keeps	OO
us	OO
in	OO
sync	OO
with	OO
our	OO
environment	.O
but	OU
what	OO
we're	OO
exposing	OO
ourselves	OO
to	OO
every	OO
day	OO
now	OO
is	OO
very	OO
much	OO
interfering	OO
with	OO
that	OO
natural	OO
system	,O
and	OO
i	OU
think	OO
it's	OO
really	OO
something	OO
to	OO
think	OO
about	.O
so	OU
when	OO
people	OO
tell	OO
you	OO
that	OO
too	OO
much	OO
light	OO
exposure	OO
at	OO
night	OO
is	OO
not	OO
good	,O
unfortunately	,O
they	OO
are	OO
actually	OO
right	.O
and	OU
the	OO
last	OO
thing	OO
i	OU
want	OO
to	OO
say	OO
is	OO
please	OO
support	OO
basic	OO
science	,O
because	OO
this	OO
is	OO
important	OO
for	OO
all	OO
of	OO
us	,O
and	OO
this	OO
is	OO
the	OO
way	OO
forward	,O
i	OU
think	.O
my	OU
mom	OO
has	OO
always	OO
reminded	OO
me	OO
that	OO
i	OU
have	OO
the	OO
same	OO
proportions	OO
as	OO
a	OO
lego	OU
man	.O
and	OU
she	OO
does	OO
actually	OO
have	OO
a	OO
point	.O
lego	OU
is	OO
a	OO
company	OO
that	OO
has	OO
succeeded	OO
in	OO
making	OO
everybody	OO
believe	OO
that	OO
lego	OU
is	OO
from	OO
their	OO
home	OO
country	.O
but	OU
it's	OO
not	,O
it's	OO
from	OO
my	OO
home	OO
country	.O
so	OU
you	OO
can	OO
imagine	OO
my	OO
excitement	OO
when	OO
the	OO
lego	OU
family	OO
called	OO
me	OO
and	OO
asked	OO
us	OO
to	OO
work	OO
with	OO
them	OO
to	OO
design	OO
the	OO
home	OU
of	OO
the	OO
brick	.U
this	OU
is	OO
the	OO
architectural	OO
model	OO
—	OO
we	OO
built	OO
it	OO
out	OO
of	OO
lego	,U
obviously	.O
this	OU
is	OO
the	OO
final	OO
result	.O
and	OU
what	OO
we	OO
tried	OO
to	OO
do	OO
was	OO
to	OO
design	OO
a	OO
building	OO
that	OO
would	OO
be	OO
as	OO
interactive	OO
and	OO
as	OO
engaging	OO
and	OO
as	OO
playful	OO
as	OO
lego	OU
is	OO
itself	,O
with	OO
these	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
interconnected	OO
playgrounds	OO
on	OO
the	OO
roofscape	.O
you	OU
can	OO
enter	OO
a	OO
square	OO
on	OO
the	OO
ground	OO
where	OO
the	OO
citizens	OO
of	OO
billund	OU
can	OO
roam	OO
around	OO
freely	OO
without	OO
a	OO
ticket	.O
and	OU
it's	OO
probably	OO
one	OO
of	OO
the	OO
only	OO
museums	OO
in	OO
the	OO
world	OO
where	OO
you're	OO
allowed	OO
to	OO
touch	OO
all	OO
the	OO
artifacts	.O
but	OU
the	OO
danish	OU
word	OO
for	OO
design	OO
is	OO
formgivning	,O
which	OO
literally	OO
means	OO
to	OO
give	OO
form	OO
to	OO
that	OO
which	OO
has	OO
not	OO
yet	OO
been	OO
given	OO
form	.O
in	OU
other	OO
words	,O
to	OO
give	OO
form	OO
to	OO
the	OO
future	.O
and	OU
what	OO
i	OU
love	OO
about	OO
lego	OU
is	OO
that	OO
lego	OU
is	OO
not	OO
a	OO
toy	.O
it's	OU
a	OO
tool	OO
that	OO
empowers	OO
the	OO
child	OO
to	OO
build	OO
his	OO
or	OO
her	OO
own	OO
world	,O
and	OO
then	OO
to	OO
inhabit	OO
that	OO
world	OO
through	OO
play	OO
and	OO
to	OO
invite	OO
her	OO
friends	OO
to	OO
join	OO
her	OO
in	OO
cohabiting	OO
and	OO
cocreating	OO
that	OO
world	.O
and	OU
that	OO
is	OO
exactly	OO
what	OO
formgivning	OO
is	.O
as	OU
human	OO
beings	,O
we	OO
have	OO
the	OO
power	OO
to	OO
give	OO
form	OO
to	OO
our	OO
future	.O
inspired	OU
by	OO
lego	,U
we've	OO
built	OO
a	OO
social	OO
housing	OO
project	OO
in	OO
copenhagen	,U
where	OO
we	OO
stacked	OO
blocks	OO
of	OO
wood	OO
next	OO
to	OO
each	OO
other	.O
between	OU
them	,O
they	OO
leave	OO
spaces	OO
with	OO
extra	OO
ceiling	OO
heights	OO
and	OO
balconies	.O
and	OU
by	OO
gently	OO
wiggling	OO
the	OO
blocks	,O
we	OO
can	OO
actually	OO
create	OO
curves	OO
or	OO
any	OO
organic	OO
form	,O
adapting	OO
to	OO
any	OO
urban	OO
context	.O
because	OU
adaptability	OO
is	OO
probably	OO
one	OO
of	OO
the	OO
strongest	OO
drivers	OO
of	OO
architecture	.O
another	OU
example	OO
is	OO
here	OO
in	OO
vancouver	.U
we	OU
were	OO
asked	OO
to	OO
look	OO
at	OO
the	OO
site	OO
where	OO
granville	OU
bridge	OO
triforks	OO
as	OO
it	OO
touches	OO
downtown	.O
and	OU
we	OO
started	,O
like	,O
mapping	OO
the	OO
different	OO
constraints	.O
there's	OU
like	OO
a	OO
100	OO
foot	OO
setback	OO
from	OO
the	OO
bridge	OO
because	OO
the	OO
city	OO
want	OO
to	OO
make	OO
sure	OO
that	OO
no	OO
one	OO
looks	OO
into	OO
the	OO
traffic	OO
on	OO
the	OO
bridge	.O
there's	OU
a	OO
park	OO
where	OO
we	OO
can't	OO
cast	OO
any	OO
shadows	.O
so	OU
finally	,O
we're	OO
left	OO
with	OO
a	OO
tiny	OO
triangular	OO
footprint	,O
almost	OO
too	OO
small	OO
to	OO
build	.O
but	OU
then	OO
we	OO
thought	,O
like	,O
what	OO
if	OO
the	OO
100	OO
foot	OO
minimum	OO
distance	OO
is	OO
really	OO
about	OO
minimum	OO
distance	OO
—	OO
once	OO
we	OO
get	OO
100	OO
feet	OO
up	OO
in	OO
the	OO
air	,O
we	OO
can	OO
grow	OO
the	OO
building	OO
back	OO
out	.O
and	OU
so	OO
we	OO
did	.O
when	OU
you	OO
drive	OO
over	OO
the	OO
bridge	,O
it's	OO
as	OO
if	OO
someone	OO
is	OO
pulling	OO
a	OO
curtain	OO
aback	,O
welcoming	OO
you	OO
to	OO
vancouver	.U
or	OU
a	OO
like	OO
a	OO
weed	OO
growing	OO
through	OO
the	OO
cracks	OO
in	OO
the	OO
pavement	OO
and	OO
blossoming	OO
as	OO
it	OO
gets	OO
light	OO
and	OO
air	.O
underneath	OU
the	OO
bridge	,O
we've	OO
worked	OO
with	OO
rodney	OU
graham	OU
and	OO
a	OO
handful	OO
of	OO
vancouver	OU
artists	,O
to	OO
create	OO
what	OO
we	OO
called	OO
the	OO
sistine	OU
chapel	OU
of	OO
street	OO
art	,O
an	OO
art	OO
gallery	OO
turned	OO
upside	OO
down	,O
that	OO
tries	OO
to	OO
turn	OO
the	OO
negative	OO
impact	OO
of	OO
the	OO
bridge	OO
into	OO
a	OO
positive	.O
so	OU
even	OO
if	OO
it	OO
looks	OO
like	OO
this	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
surreal	OO
architecture	,O
it's	OO
highly	OO
adapted	OO
to	OO
its	OO
surroundings	.O
so	OU
if	OO
a	OO
bridge	OO
can	OO
become	OO
a	OO
museum	,O
a	OO
museum	OO
can	OO
also	OO
serve	OO
as	OO
a	OO
bridge	.O
in	OU
norway	,U
we	OO
are	OO
building	OO
a	OO
museum	OO
that	OO
spans	OO
across	OO
a	OO
river	OO
and	OO
allows	OO
people	OO
to	OO
sort	OO
of	OO
journey	OO
through	OO
the	OO
exhibitions	OO
as	OO
they	OO
cross	OO
from	OO
one	OO
side	OO
of	OO
a	OO
sculpture	OO
park	OO
to	OO
the	OO
other	.O
an	OU
architecture	OO
sort	OO
of	OO
adapted	OO
to	OO
its	OO
landscape	.O
in	OU
china	,U
we	OO
built	OO
a	OO
headquarters	OO
for	OO
an	OO
energy	OO
company	OO
and	OO
we	OO
designed	OO
the	OO
facade	OO
like	OO
an	OO
issey	OU
miyake	OU
fabric	.O
it's	OU
rippled	,O
so	OO
that	OO
facing	OO
the	OO
predominant	OO
direction	OO
of	OO
the	OO
sun	,O
it's	OO
all	OO
opaque;	OO
facing	OO
away	OO
from	OO
the	OO
sun	,O
it's	OO
all	OO
glass	.O
on	OU
average	,O
it	OO
sort	OO
of	OO
transitions	OO
from	OO
solid	OO
to	OO
clear	.O
and	OU
this	OO
very	OO
simple	OO
idea	OO
without	OO
any	OO
moving	OO
parts	OO
or	OO
any	OO
sort	OO
of	OO
technology	,O
purely	OO
because	OO
of	OO
the	OO
geometry	OO
of	OO
the	OO
facade	,O
reduces	OO
the	OO
energy	OO
consumption	OO
on	OO
cooling	OO
by	OO
30	OO
percent	.O
so	OU
you	OO
can	OO
say	OO
what	OO
makes	OO
the	OO
building	OO
look	OO
elegant	OO
is	OO
also	OO
what	OO
makes	OO
it	OO
perform	OO
elegantly	.O
it's	OU
an	OO
architecture	OO
that	OO
is	OO
adapted	OO
to	OO
its	OO
climate	.O
you	OU
can	OO
also	OO
adapt	OO
one	OO
culture	OO
to	OO
another	,O
like	OO
in	OO
manhattan	,U
we	OO
took	OO
the	OO
copenhagen	OU
courtyard	OO
building	OO
with	OO
a	OO
social	OO
space	OO
where	OO
people	OO
can	OO
hang	OO
out	OO
in	OO
this	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
oasis	OO
in	OO
the	OO
middle	OO
of	OO
a	OO
city	,O
and	OO
we	OO
combined	OO
it	OO
with	OO
the	OO
density	OO
and	OO
the	OO
verticality	OO
of	OO
an	OO
american	OU
skyscraper	,O
creating	OO
what	OO
we've	OO
called	OO
a	OO
courtscraper	.O
from	OU
new	OU
york	OU
to	OO
copenhagen	.U
on	OU
the	OO
waterfront	OO
of	OO
copenhagen	,U
we	OO
are	OO
right	OO
now	OO
finishing	OO
this	OO
waste	OO
to	OO
energy	OO
power	OO
plant	.O
it's	OU
going	OO
to	OO
be	OO
the	OO
cleanest	OO
waste	OO
to	OO
energy	OO
power	OO
plant	OO
in	OO
the	OO
world	,O
there	OO
are	OO
no	OO
toxins	OO
coming	OO
out	OO
of	OO
the	OO
chimney	.O
an	OU
amazing	OO
marvel	OO
of	OO
engineering	OO
that	OO
is	OO
completely	OO
invisible	.O
so	OU
we	OO
thought	,O
how	OO
can	OO
we	OO
express	OO
this	?O
and	OU
in	OO
copenhagen	OU
we	OO
have	OO
snow	,O
as	OO
you	OO
can	OO
see	,O
but	OO
we	OO
have	OO
absolutely	OO
no	OO
mountains	.O
we	OU
have	OO
to	OO
go	OO
six	OO
hours	OO
by	OO
bus	OO
to	OO
get	OO
to	OO
sweden	,U
to	OO
get	OO
alpine	OO
skiing	.O
so	OU
we	OO
thought	,O
let's	OO
put	OO
an	OO
alpine	OO
ski	OO
slope	OO
on	OO
the	OO
roof	OO
of	OO
the	OO
power	OO
plant	.O
so	OU
this	OO
is	OO
the	OO
first	OO
test	OO
run	OO
we	OO
did	OO
a	OO
few	OO
months	OO
ago	.O
and	OU
what	OO
i	OU
like	OO
about	OO
this	OO
is	OO
that	OO
it	OO
also	OO
show	OO
you	OO
the	OO
sort	OO
of	OO
world	OO
changing	OO
power	OO
of	OO
formgivning	.O
i	OU
have	OO
a	OO
five	OO
month	OO
old	OO
son	,O
and	OO
he's	OO
going	OO
to	OO
grow	OO
up	OO
in	OO
a	OO
world	OO
not	OO
knowing	OO
that	OO
there	OO
was	OO
ever	OO
a	OO
time	OO
when	OO
you	OO
couldn't	OO
ski	OO
on	OO
the	OO
roof	OO
of	OO
the	OO
power	OO
plant	.O
so	OU
imagine	OO
for	OO
him	OO
and	OO
his	OO
generation	,O
that's	OO
their	OO
baseline	.O
imagine	OU
how	OO
far	OO
they	OO
can	OO
leap	,O
what	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
wild	OO
ideas	OO
they	OO
can	OO
put	OO
forward	OO
for	OO
their	OO
future	.O
so	OU
right	OO
in	OO
front	OO
of	OO
it	,O
we're	OO
building	OO
our	OO
smallest	OO
project	.O
it's	OU
basically	OO
nine	OO
containers	OO
that	OO
we	OO
have	OO
stacked	OO
in	OO
a	OO
shipyard	OO
in	OO
poland	,U
then	OO
we've	OO
schlepped	OO
it	OO
across	OO
the	OO
baltic	OU
sea	OO
and	OO
docked	OO
it	OO
in	OO
the	OO
port	OO
of	OO
copenhagen	,U
where	OO
it	OO
is	OO
now	OO
the	OO
home	OO
of	OO
12	OO
students	.O
each	OU
student	OO
has	OO
a	OO
view	OO
to	OO
the	OO
water	,O
they	OO
can	OO
jump	OO
out	OO
the	OO
window	OO
into	OO
the	OO
clean	OO
port	OO
of	OO
copenhagen	,U
and	OO
they	OO
can	OO
get	OO
back	OO
in	.O
all	OU
of	OO
the	OO
heat	OO
comes	OO
from	OO
the	OO
thermal	OO
mass	OO
of	OO
the	OO
sea	,O
all	OO
the	OO
power	OO
comes	OO
from	OO
the	OO
sun	.O
this	OU
is	OO
the	OO
first	OO
12	OO
units	OO
in	OO
copenhagen	,U
another	OO
60	OO
on	OO
their	OO
way	,O
another	OO
200	OO
are	OO
going	OO
to	OO
gothenburg	,U
and	OO
we're	OO
speaking	OO
with	OO
the	OO
paris	OU
olympics	OU
to	OO
put	OO
a	OO
small	OO
floating	OO
village	OO
on	OO
the	OO
seine	.U
so	OU
very	OO
much	OO
this	OO
kind	OO
of	,O
almost	OO
like	OO
nomadic	,O
impermanent	OO
architecture	.O
and	OU
the	OO
waterfronts	OO
of	OO
our	OO
cities	OO
are	OO
experiencing	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
change	.O
economic	OU
change	,O
industrial	OO
change	OO
and	OO
climate	OO

this	OU
is	OO
manhattan	OU
before	OO
hurricane	OU
sandy	,U
and	OO
this	OO
is	OO
manhattan	OU
after	OO

we	OU
got	OO
invited	OO
by	OO
the	OO
city	OO
of	OO

to	OO
look	OO
if	OO
we	OO
could	OO
make	OO
the	OO
necessary	OO
flood	OO
protection	OO
for	OO
manhattan	OU
without	OO
building	OO
a	OO
seawall	OO
that	OO
would	OO
segregate	OO
the	OO
life	OO
of	OO
the	OO
city	OO
from	OO
the	OO
water	OO
around	OO
it	.O
and	OU
we	OO
got	OO
inspired	OO
by	OO
the	OO
high	OU
line	.U
you	OU
probably	OO
know	OO
the	OO
high	OU
line	OU
—	OO
it's	OO
this	OO
amazing	OO
new	OO
park	OO
in	OO
new	OU
york	.U
it's	OU
basically	OO
decommissioned	OO
train	OO
tracks	OO
that	OO
now	OO
have	OO
become	OO
one	OO
of	OO
the	OO
most	OO
popular	OO
promenades	OO
in	OO
the	OO
city	.O
so	OU
we	OO
thought	,O
could	OO
we	OO
design	OO
the	OO
necessary	OO
flood	OO
protection	OO
for	OO
manhattan	OU
so	OO
we	OO
don't	OO
have	OO
to	OO
wait	OO
until	OO
we	OO
shut	OO
it	OO
down	OO
before	OO
it	OO
gets	OO
nice	?O
so	OU
we	OO
sat	OO
down	OO
with	OO
the	OO
citizens	OO
living	OO
along	OO
the	OO
waterfront	OO
of	OO
new	OU
york	,U
and	OO
we	OO
worked	OO
with	OO
them	OO
to	OO
try	OO
to	OO
design	OO
the	OO
necessary	OO
flood	OO
protection	OO
in	OO
such	OO
a	OO
way	OO
that	OO
it	OO
only	OO
makes	OO
their	OO
waterfront	OO
more	OO
accessible	OO
and	OO
more	OO
enjoyable	.O
underneath	OU
the	OO
fdr	,U
we	OO
are	OO
putting	,O
like	,O
pavilions	OO
with	OO
pocket	OO
walls	OO
that	OO
can	OO
slide	OO
out	OO
and	OO
protect	OO
from	OO
the	OO
water	.O
we	OU
are	OO
creating	OO
little	OO
stepped	OO
terraces	OO
that	OO
are	OO
going	OO
to	OO
make	OO
the	OO
underside	OO
more	OO
enjoyable	,O
but	OO
also	OO
protect	OO
from	OO
flooding	.O
further	OU
north	OO
in	OO
the	OO
east	OU
river	OU
park	,U
we	OO
are	OO
creating	OO
rolling	OO
hills	OO
that	OO
protect	OO
the	OO
park	OO
from	OO
the	OO
noise	OO
of	OO
the	OO
highway	,O
but	OO
in	OO
turn	OO
also	OO
become	OO
the	OO
necessary	OO
flood	OO
protection	OO
that	OO
can	OO
stop	OO
the	OO
waves	OO
during	OO
an	OO
incoming	OO
storm	OO
surge	.O
so	OU
in	OO
a	OO
way	,O
this	OO
project	OO
that	OO
we	OO
have	OO
called	OO
the	OO
dryline	,U
it's	OO
essentially	OO
the	OO
high	OU
line	OU
—	OO
the	OU
high	OU
line	OU
that's	OO
going	OO
to	OO
keep	OO
manhattan	OU
dry	.O
it's	OU
scheduled	OO
to	OO
break	OO
ground	OO
on	OO
the	OO
first	OO
east	OU
river	OU
portion	OO
at	OO
the	OO
end	OO
of	OO
this	OO
year	.O
but	OU
it	OO
has	OO
essentially	OO
been	OO
codesigned	OO
with	OO
the	OO
citizens	OO
of	OO
lower	OU
manhattan	OU
to	OO
take	OO
all	OO
of	OO
the	OO
necessary	OO
infrastructure	OO
for	OO
resilience	OO
and	OO
give	OO
it	OO
positive	OO
social	OO
and	OO
environmental	OO
side	OO
effects	.O
so	,U
new	OU
york	OU
is	OO
not	OO
alone	OO
in	OO
facing	OO
this	OO
situation	.O
in	OU
fact	,O
by	OO
2050	,O
90	OO
percent	OO
of	OO
the	OO
major	OO
cities	OO
in	OO
the	OO
world	OO
are	OO
going	OO
to	OO
be	OO
dealing	OO
with	OO
rising	OO
seas	.O
in	OU
hamburg	,U
they've	OO
created	OO
a	OO
whole	OO
neighborhood	OO
where	OO
the	OO
bottom	OO
floors	OO
are	OO
designed	OO
to	OO
withstand	OO
the	OO
inevitable	OO
flood	.O
in	OU
sweden	,U
they've	OO
designed	OO
a	OO
city	OO
where	OO
all	OO
of	OO
the	OO
parks	OO
are	OO
wet	OO
gardens	,O
designed	OO
to	OO
deal	OO
with	OO
storm	OO
water	OO
and	OO
waste	OO
water	.O
so	OU
we	OO
thought	,O
could	OO
we	OO
perhaps	OO
—	OO
actually	,U
today	,O
three	OO
million	OO
people	OO
are	OO
already	OO
permanently	OO
living	OO
on	OO
the	OO
sea	.O
so	OU
we	OO
thought	,O
could	OO
we	OO
actually	OO
imagine	OO
a	OO
floating	OO
city	OO
designed	OO
to	OO
incorporate	OO
all	OO
of	OO
the	OO
sustainable	OU
development	OU
goals	OU
of	OO
the	OO
united	OU
nations	OU
into	OO
a	OO
whole	OO
new	OO
human	OO
made	OO
ecosystem	.O
and	OU
of	OO
course	,O
we	OO
have	OO
to	OO
design	OO
it	OO
so	OO
it	OO
can	OO
produce	OO
its	OO
own	OO
power	,O
harvesting	OO
the	OO
thermal	OO
mass	OO
of	OO
the	OO
oceans	,O
the	OO
force	OO
of	OO
the	OO
tides	,O
of	OO
the	OO
currents	,O
of	OO
the	OO
waves	,O
the	OO
power	OO
of	OO
the	OO
wind	,O
the	OO
heat	OO
and	OO
the	OO
energy	OO
of	OO
the	OO
sun	.O
also	,U
we	OO
are	OO
going	OO
to	OO
collect	OO
all	OO
of	OO
the	OO
rain	OO
water	OO
that	OO
drops	OO
on	OO
this	OO
man	OO
made	OO
archipelago	OO
and	OO
deal	OO
with	OO
it	OO
organically	OO
and	OO
mechanically	OO
and	OO
store	OO
it	OO
and	OO
clean	OO
it	.O
we	OU
have	OO
to	OO
grow	OO
all	OO
of	OO
our	OO
food	OO
locally	,O
it	OO
has	OO
to	OO
be	OO
fish	OO
and	OO
plant	OO
based	,O
because	OO
you	OO
won't	OO
have	OO
the	OO
space	OO
or	OO
the	OO
resources	OO
for	OO
a	OO
dairy	OO
diet	.O
and	OU
finally	,O
we	OO
are	OO
going	OO
to	OO
deal	OO
with	OO
all	OO
the	OO
waste	OO
locally	,O
with	OO
compost	,O
recycling	,O
and	OO
turning	OO
the	OO
waste	OO
into	OO
energy	.O
so	OU
imagine	OO
where	OO
a	OO
traditional	OO
urban	OO
master	OO
plan	,O
you	OO
typically	OO
draw	OO
the	OO
street	OO
grid	OO
where	OO
the	OO
cars	OO
can	OO
drive	OO
and	OO
the	OO
building	OO
plots	OO
where	OO
you	OO
can	OO
put	OO
some	OO
buildings	.O
this	OU
master	OO
plan	,O
we	OO
sat	OO
down	OO
with	OO
a	OO
handful	OO
of	OO
scientists	OO
and	OO
basically	OO
started	OO
with	OO
all	OO
of	OO
the	OO
renewable	,O
available	OO
natural	OO
resources	,O
and	OO
then	OO
we	OO
started	OO
channeling	OO
the	OO
flow	OO
of	OO
resources	OO
through	OO
this	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
human	OO
made	OO
ecosystem	OO
or	OO
this	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
urban	OO
metabolism	.O
so	OU
it's	OO
going	OO
to	OO
be	OO
modular	,O
it's	OO
going	OO
to	OO
be	OO
buoyant	,O
it's	OO
going	OO
to	OO
be	OO
designed	OO
to	OO
resist	OO
a	OO
tropical	OO
storm	.O
you	OU
can	OO
prefabricate	OO
it	OO
at	OO
scale	,O
and	OO
tow	OO
it	OO
to	OO
dock	OO
with	OO
others	,O
to	OO
form	OO
a	OO
small	OO
community	.O
we're	OU
designing	OO
these	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
coastal	OO
additions	,O
so	OO
that	OO
even	OO
if	OO
it's	OO
modular	OO
and	OO
rational	,O
each	OO
island	OO
can	OO
be	OO
unique	OO
with	OO
its	OO
own	OO
coastal	OO
landscape	.O
the	OU
architecture	OO
has	OO
to	OO
remain	OO
relatively	OO
low	OO
to	OO
keep	OO
the	OO
center	OO
of	OO
gravity	OO
buoyant	.O
we're	OU
going	OO
to	OO
take	OO
all	OO
of	OO
the	OO
agriculture	OO
and	OO
use	OO
it	OO
to	OO
also	OO
create	OO
social	OO
space	OO
so	OO
you	OO
can	OO
actually	OO
enjoy	OO
the	OO
permaculture	OO
gardens	.O
we're	OU
designing	OO
it	OO
for	OO
the	OO
tropics	,O
so	OO
all	OO
of	OO
the	OO
roofs	OO
are	OO
maximized	OO
to	OO
harvest	OO
solar	OO
power	OO
and	OO
to	OO
shade	OO
from	OO
the	OO
sun	.O
all	OU
the	OO
materials	OO
are	OO
going	OO
to	OO
be	OO
light	OO
and	OO
renewable	,O
like	OO
bamboo	OO
and	OO
wood	,O
which	OO
is	OO
also	OO
going	OO
to	OO
create	OO
this	OO
charming	,O
warm	OO
environment	.O
and	OU
any	OO
architecture	OO
is	OO
supposed	OO
to	OO
be	OO
able	OO
to	OO
fit	OO
on	OO
this	OO
platform	.O
underneath	OU
we	OO
have	OO
all	OO
the	OO
storage	OO
inside	OO
the	OO
pontoon	,O
almost	OO
like	OO
a	OO
mega	OO
version	OO
of	OO
the	OO
student	OO
housings	OO
that	OO
we've	OO
already	OO
worked	OO
with	.O
we	OU
have	OO
all	OO
the	OO
storage	OO
for	OO
the	OO
energy	OO
that's	OO
produced	,O
all	OO
of	OO
the	OO
water	OO
storage	OO
and	OO
remediation	.O
we	OU
are	OO
sort	OO
of	OO
dealing	OO
with	OO
all	OO
of	OO
the	OO
waste	OO
and	OO
the	OO
composting	.O
and	OU
we	OO
also	OO
have	OO
some	OO
backup	OO
farming	OO
with	OO
aeroponics	OO
and	OO
hydroponics	.O
so	OU
imagine	OO
almost	OO
like	OO
a	OO
vertical	OO
section	OO
through	OO
this	OO
landscape	OO
that	OO
goes	OO
from	OO
the	OO
air	OO
above	,O
where	OO
we	OO
have	OO
vertical	OO
farms;	OO
below	,O
we	OO
have	OO
the	OO
aeroponics	OO
and	OO
the	OO
aquaponics	.O
even	OU
further	OO
below	,O
we	OO
have	OO
the	OO
ocean	OO
farms	OO
and	OO
where	OO
we	OO
tie	OO
the	OO
island	OO
to	OO
the	OO
ground	,O
we're	OO
using	OO
biorock	OO
to	OO
create	OO
new	OO
reefs	OO
to	OO
regenerate	OO
habitat	.O
so	OU
think	OO
of	OO
this	OO
small	OO
island	OO
for	OO
300	OO
people	.O
it	OU
can	OO
then	OO
group	OO
together	OO
to	OO
form	OO
a	OO
cluster	OO
or	OO
a	OO
neighborhood	OO
that	OO
then	OO
can	OO
sort	OO
of	OO
group	OO
together	OO
to	OO
form	OO
an	OO
entire	OO
city	OO
for	OO
10,000	OO
people	.O
and	OU
you	OO
can	OO
imagine	OO
if	OO
this	OO
floating	OO
city	OO
flourishes	,O
it	OO
can	OO
sort	OO
of	OO
grow	OO
like	OO
a	OO
culture	OO
in	OO
a	OO
petri	OO
dish	.O
so	OU
one	OO
of	OO
the	OO
first	OO
places	OO
we	OO
are	OO
looking	OO
at	OO
placing	OO
this	,O
or	OO
anchoring	OO
this	OO
floating	OO
city	,O
is	OO
in	OO
the	OO
pearl	OU
river	OU
delta	.O
so	OU
imagine	OO
this	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
canopy	OO
of	OO
photovoltaics	OO
on	OO
this	OO
archipelago	OO
floating	OO
in	OO
the	OO
sea	.O
as	OU
you	OO
sail	OO
towards	OO
the	OO
island	,O
you	OO
will	OO
see	OO
the	OO
maritime	OO
residents	OO
moving	OO
around	OO
on	OO
alternative	OO
forms	OO
of	OO
aquatic	OO
transportation	.O
you	OU
come	OO
into	OO
this	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
community	OO
port	.O
you	OU
can	OO
roam	OO
around	OO
in	OO
the	OO
permaculture	OO
gardens	OO
that	OO
are	OO
productive	OO
landscapes	,O
but	OO
also	OO
social	OO
landscapes	.O
the	OU
greenhouses	OO
also	OO
become	OO
orangeries	OO
for	OO
the	OO
cultural	OO
life	OO
of	OO
the	OO
city	,O
and	OO
below	,O
under	OO
the	OO
sea	,O
it's	OO
teeming	OO
with	OO
life	OO
of	OO
farming	OO
and	OO
science	OO
and	OO
social	OO
spaces	.O
so	OU
in	OO
a	OO
way	,O
you	OO
can	OO
imagine	OO
this	OO
community	OO
port	OO
is	OO
where	OO
people	OO
gather	,O
both	OO
by	OO
day	OO
and	OO
by	OO
night	.O
and	OU
even	OO
if	OO
the	OO
first	OO
one	OO
is	OO
designed	OO
for	OO
the	OO
tropics	,O
we	OO
also	OO
imagine	OO
that	OO
the	OO
architecture	OO
can	OO
adapt	OO
to	OO
any	OO
culture	,O
so	OO
imagine	,O
like	,O
a	OO
middle	OU
eastern	OU
floating	OO
city	OO
or	OO
southeast	OU
asian	OU
floating	OO
city	OO
or	OO
maybe	OO
a	OO
scandinavian	OU
floating	OO
city	OO
one	OO
day	.O
so	OU
maybe	OO
just	OO
to	OO
conclude	.O
the	OU
human	OO
body	OO
is	OO
70	OO
percent	OO
water	.O
and	OU
the	OO
surface	OO
of	OO
our	OO
planet	OO
is	OO
70	OO
percent	OO
water	.O
and	OU
it's	OO
rising	.O
and	OU
even	OO
if	OO
the	OO
whole	OO

woke	OO
up	OO
tomorrow	OO
and	OO
became	OO
carbon	OO
neutral	OO
over	OO

there	OO

the	OO

zooming	OU

i	OU

you've	OO

you	OO

you	OU

you	OO

you	OO

it	,O
the	OO

the	OO

toward	.O
to	OU
get	OO
to	OO
a	OO

you	OO
would	OO
have	OO
to	OO
drive	OO
two	OO

to	OO
the	OO

of	OO

an	OO

where	OO
the	OO

so	OO

it	OO
will	OO
cast	OO
a	OO

a	OO

the	OO

100	OO

you	OU

but	OU
the	OO
thing	OO
is	OO
rapid	OU
city	OU
is	OO
not	OO
alone	.O
light	OU
pollution	OO
plagues	OO
every	OO
modern	OO
city	OO

the	OU
good	OO
news	,O
however	,O
is	OO
that	OO
light	OO

could	OO
possibly	OO
be	OO
the	OO

so	OU
if	OO

you	OO

that	OO
it's	OO

now	OU
just	OO

here's	OO
a	OO

you	OU

ask	OO
your	OO

even	OU
if	OO

if	OO
we	OO

we	OU

our	OO

now	,U

there's	OU
an	OO

12	OO

an	OO

in	OU

in	OO

an	OO

you	OO

something	OO

this	OO

that	OU

principle;	OO
it's	OO
not	OO
because	OO
some	OO
famous	OO
guy	OO
says	OO
so	.O
there	OU
are	OO
reasons	,O
theoretical	OO
reasons	,O
observational	OO
reasons	,O
experiments	OO
show	OO
it	,O
it	OO
is	OO
a	OO
verified	OO
fact	,O
but	OO
why	?O
basically	,U
the	OO
answer	OO
is	OO
that	OO
theory	OO
of	OO
relativity	OO
prevents	OO
it	,O
so	OO
i	OU
will	OO
tell	OO
you	OO
a	OO
bit	,O
a	OO
very	OO
quick	OO
course:	OO
relativity	OU
in	OO
a	OO
couple	OO
of	OO
minutes	.O
don't	OU
be	OO
afraid	,O
i'll	OU
give	OO
a	OO
general	OO
overview	,O
normally	OO
it	OO
takes	OO
six	OO
months	OO
to	OO
teach	OO
this	OO
to	OO
sixth	OO
and	OO
seventh	OO
graders	OO
of	OO
physics	OO
major	.O
so	OU
right	OO
now	OO
i	OU
will	OO
explain	OO
it	OO
in	OO
two	OO
minutes	OO
and	OO
for	OO
non	OO
physicists	.O
so	,U
don't	OO
worry	.O
relativity	OU
is	OO
an	OO
old	OO
concept	OO
though	OO
it	OO
wasn't	OO
called	OO
like	OO
that	.O
the	OU
concept	OO
can	OO
be	OO
traced	OO
back	OO
from	OO
galileo	OU
galilei	OU
around	OO
1620	,O
in	OO
the	OO
17th	OO
century	.O
galileo	OU
was	OO
the	OO
first	OO
one	OO
to	OO
realize	OO
something	OO
interesting	,O
when	OO
it	OO
comes	OO
to	OO
movement	,O
when	OO
i	OU
move	,O
my	OO
movement	OO
is	OO
always	OO
relative	OO
to	OO
something	OO
else	.O
movement	OU
is	OO
said	OO
to	OO
be	OO
relative	,O
here	OO
on	OO
the	OO
stage	,O
my	OO
movement	OO
is	OO
relative	OO
to	OO
the	OO
floor	.O
the	OU
measurement	OO
of	OO
your	OO
car	OO
speed	OO
is	OO
relative	OO
to	OO
the	OO
street	,O
actually	OO
planes	OO
speed	OO
measurement	OO
is	OO
made	OO
relative	OO
to	OO
the	OO
air	,O
not	OO
the	OO
floor	.O
you	OU
might	OO
have	OO
noticed	OO
this	OO
while	OO
watching	OO
a	OO
movie	.O
a	OU
plane	OO
speed	OO
measurement	OO
is	OO
relative	OO
to	OO
the	OO
air	,O
and	OO
the	OO
earth	OU
spins	OO
around	OO
the	OO
sun	,U
etc	.O
if	OU
you	OO
were	OO
somewhere	OO
in	OO
space	OO
in	OO
the	OO
middle	OO
of	OO
nowhere	OO
it	OO
would	OO
be	OO
useless	OO
to	OO
ask	OO
if	OO
you	OO
are	OO
moving	OO
or	OO
not	OO
because	OO
there	OO
is	OO
no	OO
reference	OO
to	OO
compare	OO
your	OO
position	,O
so	OO
movement	OO
is	OO
relative	,O
speeds	OO
are	OO
relative	,O
because	OO
they	OO
are	OO
always	OO
measured	OO
in	OO
relation	OO
to	OO
something	OO
else	.O
this	OU
was	OO
discovered	OO
by	OO
galileo	OU
400	OO
years	OO
ago	.O
that	OU
was	OO
an	OO
interesting	OO
fact	OO
for	OO
all	OO
physic	OO
studies	OO
made	OO
after	OO
galileo	.U
newton	OU
and	OO
all	OO
great	OO
advances	OO
of	OO
the	OO
18th	OO
and	OO
19th	OO
centuries	OO
agreed	OO
with	OO
galileo	.U
speed	OU
is	OO
relative	,O
that's	OO
fine	,O
speeds	OO
aren't	OO
absolute	.O
but	OU
by	OO
the	OO
end	OO
of	OO
19th	OO
century	OO
something	OO
strange	OO
happened	,O
many	OO
physicists	OO
studying	OO
light	OO
discovered	OO
that	OO
light	OO
is	OO
quite	OO
weird	,O
light	OO
speed	OO
is	OO
indeed	OO
absolute	OO
and	OO
though	OO
galileo	OU
stated	OO
that	OO
speeds	OO
were	OO
relative	,O
that's	OO
not	OO
the	OO
case	OO
of	OO
light	,O
it's	OO
always	OO
the	OO
same	OO
number	OO
no	OO
matter	OO
who	OO
measures	OO
it	,O
or	OO
how	OO
fast	OO
is	OO
going	OO
whoever	OO
is	OO
measuring	,O
no	OO
matter	OO
how	OO
fast	OO
the	OO
lightbulb	OO
sending	OO
out	OO
the	OO
light	OO
is	OO
moving	.O
the	OU
measurement	OO
always	OO
yields	OO
the	OO
same	OO
number	OO
and	OO
this	OO
was	OO
a	OO
problem	.O
this	OU
might	OO
not	OO
seem	OO
interesting	OO
to	OO
you	OO
but	OO
physicists	OO
of	OO
the	OO
19th	OO
century	OO
were	OO
going	OO
crazy	.O
problem	OU
was:	OO
either	OO
galileo	OU
was	OO
wrong	OO
and	OO
speeds	OO
were	OO
indeed	OO
absolute	,O
which	OO
was	OO
apparently	OO
nonsense;	OO
or	OO
those	OO
who	OO
were	OO
measuring	OO
light	OO
speed	OO
were	OO
wrong	OO
and	OO
didn't	OO
know	OO
how	OO
to	OO
measure	.O
but	OU
nobody	OO
was	OO
wrong	OO
which	OO
was	OO
even	OO
worst	.O
decades	OU
went	OO
by	,O
until	OO
in	OO
1905	OO
this	OO
guy	OO
appeared	,O
a	OO
man	OO
called	OO
albert	OU
einstein	,U
who	OO
devoted	OO
his	OO
life	OO
to	OO
bringing	OO
together	OO
galileo's	OU
idea	OO
that	OO
speeds	OO
were	OO
relative	OO
and	OO
the	OO
apparently	OO
real	OO
fact	OO
shown	OO
by	OO
the	OO
experiments	,O
that	OO
there	OO
was	OO
an	OO
absolute	OO
speed	,O
light	OO
speed	.O
long	OU
story	OO
short	,O
because	OO
math	OO
is	OO
complicated	,O
part	OO
of	OO
einstein	OU
genius	OO
was	OO
realizing	OO
there	OO
was	OO
a	OO
solution	.O
there	OU
was	OO
a	OO
logical	OO
solution	OO
to	OO
the	OO
problem	OO
and	OO
that	OO
logical	OO
solution	OO
derived	OO
in	OO
what	OO
we	OO
now	OO
know	OO
as	OO
einstein's	OU
theory	OO
of	OO
relativity	.O
it's	OU
a	OO
very	OO
interesting	OO
theory	OO
that	OO
changes	OO
what	OO
we	OO
understand	OO
by	OO
space	OO
and	OO
time	,O
for	OO
instance	,O
nobody	OO
tells	OO
us	OO
that	OO
space	OO
is	OO
relative	OO
distances	,O
object	OO
lengths	OO
depend	OO
on	OO
their	OO
movement;	OO
if	OO
an	OO
object	OO
moves	OO
fast	,O
they	OO
shrink	.O
time	OU
is	OO
also	OO
relative	,O
any	OO
watch	OO
ticking	OO
relative	OO
to	OO
my	OO
movement	,O
would	OO
delay	OO
this	OO
we	OO
have	OO
measured	OO
many	OO
times	,O
even	OO
worst:	OO
simultaneity	OO
is	OO
relative;	OO
when	OO
i	OU
say	OO
two	OO
things	OO
happen	OO
exactly	OO
at	OO
once	,O
someone	OO
moving	OO
in	OO
relation	OO
to	OO
me	OO
would	OO
disagree	.O
one	OU
of	OO
us	OO
sees	OO
something	OO
first	OO
and	OO
worst:	OO
we	OO
might	OO
be	OO
moving	OO
on	OO
opposed	OO
directions	OO
and	OO
watch	OO
things	OO
backwards:	OO
first	OO
this	OO
one	,O
then	OO
that	OO
one	.O
so	OU
the	OO
conclusion	OO
is	OO
that	OO
sometimes	,O
the	OO
order	OO
in	OO
time	OO
of	OO
different	OO
things	OO
is	OO
not	OO
absolute	,O
the	OO
order	OO
of	OO
time	OO
can	OO
change	,O
one	OO
thing	OO
before	,O
other	OO
thing	OO
after	OO
but	OO
this	OO
brings	OO
up	OO
another	OO
huge	OO
problem	,O
if	OO
time	OO
order	OO
is	OO
not	OO
well	OO
defined	,O
what	OO
about	OO
causality	?O
if	OU
something	OO
causes	OO
something	OO
else	OO
that	OO
something	OO
should	OO
had	OO
happened	OO
first	,O
but	OO
if	OO
we	OO
disagree	OO
on	OO
what	OO
happened	OO
first	,O
where	OO
does	OO
that	OO
leaves	OO
causality	?O
another	OU
crisis	.O
part	OU
of	OO
what	OO
einstein	OU
did	OO
was	OO
realizing	OO
that	OO
there	OO
was	OO
solution	,O
a	OO
solution	OO
to	OO
protect	OO
causality	OO
was	OO
thinking	OO
that	OO
light	OO
speed	OO
is	OO
not	OO
absolute	,O
but	OO
the	OO
maximum	OO
speed	OO
of	OO
universe	.O
if	OU
nothing	OO
can	OO
travel	OO
faster	OO
than	OO
light	OO
we	OO
protect	OO
causality	.O
if	OU
something	OO
could	OO
travel	OO
faster	OO
than	OO
light	OO
then	OO
we	OO
could	OO
travel	OO
to	OO
the	OO
past	,O
we	OO
would	OO
be	OO
able	OO
to	OO
see	OO
the	OO
effect	OO
before	OO
the	OO
cause	,O
which	OO
is	OO
not	OO
the	OO
proper	OO
way	.O
so	OU
light	OO
speed	OO
is	OO
the	OO
maximum	OO
speed	OO
and	OO
that	OO
is	OO
to	OO
protect	OO
causality	.O
so	OU
far	OO
as	OO
of	OO
the	OO
beginning	OO
of	OO
the	OO
20th	OO
century	,O
light	OO
speed	OO
was	OO
the	OO
fastest	OO
and	OO
if	OO
that	OO
was	OO
all	OO
left	OO
to	OO
say	,O
my	OO
talk	OO
would	OO
be	OO
done	OO
and	OO
off	OO
we	OO
go	.O
but	,U
fortunately	OO
that's	OO
not	OO
the	OO
case	.O
in	OU
1916	,O
einstein	OU
developed	OO
a	OO
second	OO
theory	,O
also	OO
called	OO
relativity	OO
and	OO
that's	OO
why	OO
people	OO
get	OO
confused	OO
this	OO
one	OO
is	OO
called	OO
general	OO
relativity	,O
and	OO
it's	OO
a	OO
theory	OO
about	OO
gravity	.O
einstein	OU
tried	OO
to	OO
understand	OO
gravity	,O
which	OO
we	OO
already	OO
understood	OO
a	OO
bit	OO
since	OO
newton;	OU
but	OO
he	OO
noticed	OO
some	OO
problems	,O
gravity	OO
was	OO
thought	OO
of	OO
by	OO
newton	OU
as	OO
instantaneous	,O
if	OO
someone	OO
moved	OO
the	OO
sun	,U
earth	OU
would	OO
immediately	OO
react	,O
this	OO
would	OO
go	OO
against	OO
the	OO
fact	OO
that	OO
nothing	OO
can	OO
travel	OO
faster	OO
than	OO
light	,O
so	OO
einstein	OU
began	OO
to	OO
develop	OO
a	OO
new	OO
gravity	OO
theory	,O
it	OO
took	OO
him	OO
10	OO
years	,O
an	OO
amazing	OO
achievement	OO
for	OO
someone	OO
as	OO
smart	OO
of	OO
einstein	,U
was	OO
based	OO
on	OO
a	OO
beautiful	OO
thing:	OO
the	OO
equivalence	OU
principle	,U
also	OO
discovered	OO
by	OO
galileo:	OU
all	OO
objects	OO
fall	OO
at	OO
the	OO
same	OO
speed	OO
if	OO
two	OO
things	OO
were	OO
dropped	OO
at	OO
once	,O
they	OO
would	OO
fall	OO
at	OO
the	OO
same	OO
time	,O
a	OO
bowling	OO
ball	OO
or	OO
a	OO
ping	OO
pong	OO
ball	OO
would	OO
fall	OO
just	OO
the	OO
same	,O
the	OO
heavier	OO
one	OO
does	OO
not	OO
fall	OO
faster	,O
in	OO
case	OO
you	OO
were	OO
wondering	.O
that	OU
means	,O
from	OO
another	OO
point	OO
of	OO
view	,O
that	OO
the	OO
trajectory	OO
of	OO
an	OO
object	OO
when	OO
there	OO
is	OO
gravity	,O
does	OO
not	OO
depend	OO
on	OO
the	OO
object	.O
all	OU
objects	OO
follow	OO
the	OO
same	OO
trajectory	OO
curved	OO
trajectories	,O
you've	OO
seen	OO
that	,O
i	OU
throw	OO
objects	OO
and	OO
they	OO
move	OO
in	OO
parables	OO
and	OO
ellipses	OO
but	OO
if	OO
those	OO
trajectories	OO
are	OO
curve	OO
and	OO
nondependent	OO
of	OO
the	OO
object	OO
then	OO
trajectory	OO
is	OO
a	OO
property	OO
of	OO
space	,O
but	OO
they	OO
are	OO
curve	,O
then	OO
space	OO
must	OO
be	OO
curve	.O
einstein	OU
concluded	OO
that	OO
gravity	OO
is	OO
a	OO
space	OO
deformation	.O
an	OU
interesting	OO
and	OO
beautiful	OO
thing	,O
and	OO
what	OO
is	OO
beautiful	OO
about	OO
it	OO
is	OO
that	OO
i	OU
can	OO
cheat	,O
i	OU
can	OO
use	OO
space	OO
deformation	OO
to	OO
cheat	OO
on	OO
einstein	OU
himself	,O
so	OO
i	OU
use	OO
einstein	OU
to	OO
cheat	OO
on	OO
einstein	.U
i	OU
can	OO
imagine	OO
ways	OO
to	OO
distort	OO
space	OO
to	OO
work	OO
around	OO
the	OO
statement	OO
nothing	OO
can	OO
go	OO
faster	OO
than	OO
light	OO
and	,O
technically	,O
i	OU
could	OO
reach	OO
a	OO
faraway	OO
star	OO
and	OO
then	OO
come	OO
back	OO
in	OO
time	OO
for	OO
dinner	.O
i	OU
will	OO
share	OO
with	OO
you	OO
two	OO
possibilities	,O
that	OO
are	OO
allowed	OO
on	OO
einstein	OU
theory	,O
one	OO
is	OO
beautiful	OO
and	OO
its	OO
technical	OO
name	OO
is	OO
einstein	OU
rosen	OU
bridge	,O
sounds	OO
technical	OO
because	OO
einstein	OU
and	OO
another	OO
scientist	OO
called	OO
rosen	OU
had	OO
this	OO
idea	OO
in	OO
1935	.O
but	OU
in	OO
literature	OO
and	OO
on	OO
sci	OO
fi	OO
movies	OO
it	OO
is	OO
called	OO
a	OO
wormhole	.U
if	OU
you	OO
like	OO
science	OO
fiction	OO
then	OO
you	OO
might	OO
have	OO
seen	OO
it	OO
recently	,O
in	OO
the	OO
movie	OO
interstellar	.U
on	OU
the	OO
movie	,O
they	OO
travel	OO
through	OO
a	OO
wormhole	.O
a	OU
wormhole	OO
is	OO
like	OO
a	OO
tunnel	,O
i	OU
enter	OO
here	OO
and	OO
i	OU
end	OO
up	OO
in	OO
alpha	OU
centauri	,U
but	OO
traveling	OO
a	OO
shorter	OO
distance	,O
like	OO
a	OO
shortcut	OO
in	OO
space	.O
these	OU
structures	OO
—	OO
here	OO
is	OO
a	OO
beautiful	OO
diagram	OO
of	OO
a	OO
wormhole	OO
in	OO
two	OO
dimensions	OO
—	OO
are	OO
allowed	OO
by	OO
the	OO
einstein's	OU
theory	,O
because	OO
this	OO
theory	OO
allows	OO
these	OO
tunnels	,O
one	OO
thing	OO
is	OO
that	OO
the	OO
theory	OO
allows	OO
it	OO
and	OO
another	OO
is	OO
having	OO
an	OO
idea	OO
of	OO
how	OO
to	OO
do	OO
that	.O
nobody	OU
knows	OO
how	OO
to	OO
make	OO
a	OO
wormhole	,O
but	OO
at	OO
least	OO
theory	OO
allows	OO
it	.O
another	OU
idea	,O
and	OO
i'll	OU
let	OO
you	OO
think	OO
about	OO
it	,O
another	OO
idea	OO
is	OO
that	OO
it	OO
is	OO
not	OO
necessary	OO
to	OO
make	OO
holes	OO
in	OO
space	,O
an	OO
idea	OO
that	OO
thought	OO
by	OO
some	OO
guy	OO
not	OO
so	OO
long	OO
ago	,O
in	OO
1994	,O
this	OO
guy	OO
on	OO
the	OO
picture	,O
and	OO
the	OO
idea	OO
is	OO
different;	OO
instead	OO
of	OO
making	OO
holes	OO
in	OO
space	OO
let's	OO
use	OO
another	OO
property	OO
of	OO
space	.O
space	OU
can	OO
bended	,O
twisted	OO
and	OO
expanded	,O
maybe	OO
you	OO
heard	OO
about	OO
how	OO
universe	OO
expands	,O
galaxies	OO
move	OO
away	OO
from	OO
one	OO
another	OO
not	OO
because	OO
they	OO
are	OO
drifting	OO
away	OO
from	OO
a	OO
center	OO
where	OO
an	OO
explosion	OO
occurred	,O
no	.O
the	OU
way	OO
we	OO
understand	OO
it	OO
in	OO
physics	OO
is	OO
that	OO
galaxies	OO
are	OO
still	,O
and	OO
what	OO
is	OO
growing	OO
bigger	OO
is	OO
space;	OO
space	OO
is	OO
expanding	.O
so	OU
i	OU
can	OO
use	OO
this	OO
idea	OO
in	OO
a	OO
small	OO
scale	.O
imagine	OU
i'm	OU
standing	OO
here	OO
and	OO
somehow	OO
i	OU
can	OO
expand	OO
the	OO
space	OO
behind	OO
me	.O
i	OU
would	OO
start	OO
to	OO
drift	OO
away	OO
from	OO
that	OO
wall	,O
and	OO
if	OO
at	OO
the	OO
same	OO
time	OO
i	OU
shrink	OO
the	OO
space	OO
in	OO
front	OO
of	OO
me	OO
i	OU
would	OO
become	OO
closer	OO
to	OO
the	OO
wall	OO
in	OO
front	OO
of	OO
me	.O
if	OU
i	OU
combine	OO
the	OO
expansion	OO
and	OO
contraction	,O
i	OU
could	OO
move	OO
from	OO
here	OO
to	OO
that	OO
wall	OO
without	OO
moving	,O
because	OO
the	OO
space	OO
made	OO
all	OO
the	OO
moving	.O
this	OU
is	OO
called	OO
warp	OO
drive	OO
or	OO
drive	OO
through	OO
distortion	OO
and	OO
it's	OO
another	OO
way	OO
to	OO
travel	OO
faster	OO
than	OO
light	,O
actually	OO
you	OO
could	OO
travel	OO
as	OO
fast	OO
as	OO
you	OO
wish	.O
these	OU
are	OO
two	OO
ideas	OO
on	OO
how	OO
we	OO
could	OO
travel	OO
faster	OO
than	OO
light	.O
but	OU
there	OO
is	OO
a	OO
price	OO
to	OO
pay	.O
such	OU
is	OO
life	,O
whenever	OO
you	OO
find	OO
something	OO
cool	OO
it's	OO
too	OO
expensive	.O
we	OU
have	OO
a	OO
similar	OO
case	OO
here:	OO
from	OO
those	OO
two	OO
ideas	,O
both	OO
worm	OO
holes	OO
and	OO
warp	OO
propulsion	OO
require	,O
whenever	OO
we	OO
do	OO
the	OO
math	OO
of	OO
something	OO
called	OO
negative	OO
energy	,O
which	OO
might	OO
not	OO
be	OO
crystal	OO
clear	OO
for	OO
you	,O
but	OO
remember	OO
what	OO
einstein	OU
said:	OO
mass	OO
and	OO
energy	OO
are	OO
equivalent	,O
the	OO
same	OO
thing	.O
remember	OU
nuclear	OO
reactors	OO
and	OO
atomic	OO
bombs	,O
mass	OO
and	OO
energy	OO
are	OO
the	OO
same	.O
so	OU
negative	OO
energy	OO
equals	OO
negative	OO
mass	,O
and	OO
i'd	OU
never	OO
went	OO
to	OO
buy	OO
minus	OO
9	OO
pounds	OO
of	OO
tortilla	.O
there	OU
are	OO
no	OO
negative	OO
masses	,O
without	OO
negative	OO
masses	OO
there	OO
are	OO
no	OO
negative	OO
energies	OO
and	OO
without	OO
negative	OO
energies	OO
none	OO
of	OO
this	OO
is	OO
possible	,O
no	OU
holes	OO
in	OO
space	OO
time	,O
no	OO
warp	OO
propulsion	,O
and	OO
that's	OO
a	OO
problem	.O
negative	OU
energy	OO
is	OO
not	OO
forbidden	,O
physics	OO
laws	OO
don't	OO
forbid	OO
it	,O
but	OO
we've	OO
never	OO
seen	OO
it	.O
it's	OU
one	OO
of	OO
those	OO
things	OO
that	OO
simply	OO
do	OO
not	OO
exist	.O
so	,U
with	OO
this	OO
initial	OO
question:	OO
can	OU
we	OO
travel	OO
faster	OO
than	OO
light	?O
will	OO
we	OO
someday	OO
travel	OO
the	OO
stars	OO
and	OO
get	OO
back	OO
in	OO
time	OO
for	OO
dinner	?O
in	OU
1905	OO
einstein	OU
told	OO
us	OO
it	OO
was	OO
not	OO
possible	,O
that	OO
light	OO
speed	OO
was	OO
a	OO
limit	,O
but	OO
sometimes	,O
using	OO
einstein's	OU
other	OO
theory	,O
general	OO
relativity	,O
we	OO
can	OO
cheat	OO
and	OO
bend	OO
the	OO
space	,O
expand	OO
it	,O
compress	OO
it	,O
make	OO
holes	OO
on	OO
it	,O
and	OO
travel	OO
faster	OO
than	OO
light	,O
however	,O
the	OO
price	OO
of	OO
it	OO
is	OO
finding	OO
energies	OO
or	OO
negative	OO
masses	,O
though	OO
they	OO
might	OO
not	OO
exist	.O
so	OU
we	OO
are	OO
a	OO
bit	OO
stuck	,O
but	OO
such	OO
is	OO
science	OO
and	OO
that's	OO
part	OO
of	OO
my	OO
message	,O
science	OO
moves	OO
forward	OO
by	OO
making	OO
questions	,O
and	OO
sometimes	OO
we	OO
find	OO
answers	,O
sometimes	OO
we	OO
find	OO
answers	OO
we	OO
don't	OO
like	,O
that	OO
aren't	OO
what	OO
we	OO
wanted	,O
but	OO
universe	OO
is	OO
not	OO
how	OO
we	OO
want	OO
it	.O
it	OU
is	OO
what	OO
it	OO
is	OO
and	OO
we	OO
sometimes	OO
find	OO
out	OO
that	OO
we	OO
don't	OO
have	OO
enough	OO
information	,O
to	OO
answer	OO
the	OO
question	,O
and	OO
that	OO
is	OO
our	OO
current	OO
situation	.O
currently	,U
we	OO
do	OO
not	OO

all	OO
the	OO

luckily	,U
in	OO
20	,O
30	OO
or	OO
100	OO
years	OO
someone	OO
will	OO
come	OO
and	OO
find	OO
the	OO
answer	OO

us	OO
for	OO

if	OO
we	OO

the	OO

they	OO

there	OO

they	OO

me	OO
this	OO

i	OU

to	OO
it	.O
they	OU

when	OU
the	OO

they	OO

it’s	OU
an	OO
increasingly	OO

sight	OO

a	OO

attaches	OO
a	OO
glowing	OO

suddenly	,U
a	OO

how	OU

learn	OO
something	OO
about	OO

without	OO

here’s	OU
the	OO
trick:	OO
our	OO
bodies	OO
are	OO
translucent	,O
meaning	OO
they	OO
don’t	OO
completely	OO
block	OO
and	OO
reflect	OO
light	.O
rather	,U
they	OO
allow	OO
some	OO
light	OO
to	OO
actually	OO

it	?O
hold	OU
a	OO

it	OO
turns	OO

can	OO
help	OO

the	OO

our	OO
bodies	.O
consider	OU
that	OO
medical	OO
fingerclip—	OO
it’s	OO
called	OO
a	OO
pulse	OO
oximeter	.O
when	OU
you	OO
inhale	,O
your	OO
lungs	OO
transfer	OO
oxygen	OO
into	OO
hemoglobin	OO
molecules	,O
and	OO
the	OO
pulse	OO
oximeter	OO
measures	OO
the	OO
ratio	OO
of	OO
oxygenated	OO
to	OO
oxygen	OO
free	OO
hemoglobin	.O
it	OU
does	OO
this	OO
by	OO
using	OO
a	OO
tiny	OO
red	OO
led	OU
light	OO
on	OO
one	OO
side	OO
of	OO
the	OO
fingerclip	,O
and	OO
a	OO
small	OO
light	OO
detector	OO
on	OO
the	OO

when	OU
the	OO
led	OU
shines	OO
into	OO
your	OO
finger	,O
oxygen	OO
free	OO
hemoglobin	OO
in	OO
your	OO
blood	OO
vessels	OO
absorbs	OO
the	OO
red	OO
light	OO
more	OO
strongly	OO
than	OO
its	OO
oxygenated	OO
counterpart	.O
so	OU
the	OO
amount	OO
of	OO
light	OO
that	OO
makes	OO
it	OO
out	OO
the	OO
other	OO
side	OO
depends	OO
on	OO
the	OO
concentration	OO
ratio	OO
of	OO
the	OO
two	OO
types	OO
of	OO
hemoglobin	.O
but	OU
any	OO
two	OO
patients	OO
will	OO
have	OO

in	OO
their	OO

for	OU
one	OO
patient	,O
a	OO
saturation	OO
reading	OO
of	OO
ninety	OO
five	OO
percent	OO
corresponds	OO
to	OO
a	OO
healthy	OO
oxygen	OO
level	,O
but	OO
for	OO
another	OO
with	OO
smaller	OO
arteries	,O
the	OO
same	OO
reading	OO
could	OO
dangerously	OO
misrepresent	OO
the	OO
actual	OO
oxygen	OO
level	.O
this	OU
can	OO
be	OO
accounted	OO
for	OO
with	OO
a	OO
second	OO
infrared	OO

led	.U
light	OU
comes	OO
in	OO
a	OO

the	OO

so	,U
we	OO
all	OO
have	OO
bad	OO
seasons	OO
in	OO

and	OU
i	OU
had	OO
one	OO
in	OO
2013	.O
my	OU
marriage	OO
had	OO
just	OO
ended	,O
and	OO
i	OU
was	OO
humiliated	OO
by	OO
that	OO
failed	OO

my	OU
kids	OO
had	OO
left	OO
home	OO
for	OO
college	OO
or	OO
were	OO
leaving	.O
i	OU
grew	OO
up	OO
mostly	OO
in	OO
the	OO
conservative	OO
movement	,O
but	OO
conservatism	OO
had	OO
changed	,O
so	OO
i	OU
lost	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
those	OO
friends	,O
too	.O
and	OU
so	OO
what	OO
i	OU
did	OO
is	,O
i	OU
lived	OO
alone	OO
in	OO
an	OO
apartment	,O
and	OO
i	OU
just	OO
worked	.O
if	OU
you	OO
opened	OO
the	OO
kitchen	OO

where	OO
there	OO
should	OO
have	OO
been	OO

there	OO
were	OO

it	OO

if	OU
you	OO
opened	OO
the	OO

where	OO
there	OO
should	OO
have	OO
been	OO
plates	,O
i	OU
had	OO

i	OU
had	OO
work	OO
friends	,O
weekday	OO
friends	,O
but	OO
i	OU
didn't	OO
have	OO
weekend	OO
friends	.O
and	OU
so	OO
my	OO
weekends	OO
were	OO
these	OO
long	,O
howling	OO
silences	.O
and	OU
i	OU
was	OO
lonely	.O
and	OU
loneliness	,O
unexpectedly	,O
came	OO
to	OO
me	OO
in	OO
the	OO
form	OO
of	OO
—	OO
it	OO
felt	OO
like	OO
fear	,O
a	OO
burning	OO
in	OO
my	OO
stomach	.O
and	OU
it	OO
felt	OO
a	OO
little	OO
like	OO
drunkenness	,O
just	OO
making	OO
bad	OO
decisions	,O
just	OO
fluidity	,O
lack	OO
of	OO
solidity	.O
and	OU
the	OO
painful	OO
part	OO
of	OO
that	OO
moment	OO
was	OO
the	OO
awareness	OO
that	OO
the	OO
emptiness	OO
in	OO
my	OO
apartment	OO
was	OO
just	OO
reflective	OO
of	OO
the	OO
emptiness	OO
in	OO
myself	,O
and	OO
that	OO
i	OU
had	OO
fallen	OO
for	OO
some	OO
of	OO
the	OO
lies	OO
that	OO
our	OO
culture	OO
tells	OO
us	.O
the	OU
first	OO
lie	OO
is	OO
that	OO
career	OO
success	OO
is	OO
fulfilling	.O
i've	OU
had	OO
a	OO
fair	OO
bit	OO
of	OO
career	OO
success	,O
and	OO
i've	OU
found	OO
that	OO
it	OO
helps	OO
me	OO
avoid	OO
the	OO
shame	OO
i	OU
would	OO
feel	OO
if	OO
i	OU
felt	OO
myself	OO
a	OO
failure	,O
but	OO
it	OO
hasn't	OO
given	OO
me	OO
any	OO
positive	OO
good	.O
the	OU
second	OO
lie	OO
is	OO
i	OU
can	OO
make	OO
myself	OO
happy	,O
that	OO
if	OO
i	OU
just	OO
win	OO
one	OO
more	OO
victory	,O
lose	OO
15	OO
pounds	,O
do	OO
a	OO
little	OO
more	OO
yoga	,O
i'll	OU
get	OO
happy	.O
and	OU
that's	OO
the	OO
lie	OO
of	OO
self	OO
sufficiency	.O
but	OU
as	OO
anybody	OO
on	OO
their	OO
deathbed	OO
will	OO
tell	OO
you	,O
the	OO
things	OO
that	OO
make	OO
people	OO
happy	OO
is	OO
the	OO
deep	OO
relationships	OO
of	OO
life	,O
the	OO
losing	OO
of	OO
self	OO
sufficiency	.O
the	OU
third	OO
lie	OO
is	OO
the	OO
lie	OO
of	OO
the	OO
meritocracy	.O
the	OU
message	OO
of	OO
the	OO
meritocracy	OO
is	OO
you	OO
are	OO
what	OO
you	OO
accomplish	.O
the	OU
myth	OO
of	OO
the	OO
meritocracy	OO
is	OO
you	OO
can	OO
earn	OO
dignity	OO
by	OO
attaching	OO
yourself	OO
to	OO
prestigious	OO
brands	.O
the	OU
emotion	OO
of	OO
the	OO
meritocracy	OO
is	OO
conditional	OO
love	,O
you	OO
can	OO
earn	OO
your	OO
way	OO
to	OO
love	.O
the	OU
anthropology	OO
of	OO
the	OO
meritocracy	OO
is	OO
you're	OO
not	OO
a	OO
soul	OO
to	OO
be	OO
purified	,O
you're	OO
a	OO
set	OO
of	OO
skills	OO
to	OO
be	OO
maximized	.O
and	OU
the	OO
evil	OO
of	OO
the	OO
meritocracy	OO
is	OO
that	OO
people	OO
who've	OO
achieved	OO
a	OO
little	OO
more	OO
than	OO
others	OO
are	OO
actually	OO
worth	OO
a	OO
little	OO
more	OO
than	OO
others	.O
and	OU
so	OO
the	OO
wages	OO
of	OO
sin	OO
are	OO
sin	.O
and	OU
my	OO
sins	OO
were	OO
the	OO
sins	OO
of	OO
omission—	OO
not	OO
reaching	OO
out	,O
failing	OO
to	OO

up	OO
for	OO
my	OO

the	OU

and	OU
from	OO

period	OO
where	OO

started	,O
i've	OU
had	OO
a	OO

realizations	.O

is	,O
freedom	OO

the	OU

is	OO
not	OO
an	OO
ocean	OO
you	OO

to	OO
swim	OO
in	,O
it's	OO
a	OO
river	OO
you	OO
want	OO
to	OO
get	OO
across	,O
so	OO
you	OO
can	OO
commit	OO
and	OO
plant	OO
yourself	OO
on	OO
the	OO
other	OO

the	OU
second	OO
thing	OO
i	OU
learned	OO
is	OO
that	OO
when	OO
you	OO
have	OO
one	OO
of	OO
those	OO
bad	OO
moments	OO
in	OO
life	,O
you	OO
can	OO
either	OO

that	OO
it's	OO

of	OO

you	OO

the	OO

the	OU

and	OO
you	OO
get	OO
into	OO
the	OO

the	OO

the	OU
idea	OO
that	OO
what	OO
we	OO
really	OO
yearn	OO
for	OO
is	OO
longing	OO
and	OO
love	OO
for	OO
another	,O
the	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
thing	OO
that	OO
louis	OU

bernières	OU
described	OO
in	OO
his	OO
book	,O
captain	OU
corelli's	OU
mandolin	.U
he	OU
had	OO
an	OO
old	OO
guy	OO
talking	OO
to	OO
his	OO

about	OO
his	OO
relationship	OO
with	OO
his	OO
late	OO

and	OO
the	OO
old	OO

says	,O
love	OU
itself	OO
is	OO
whatever	OO
is	OO
leftover	OO
when	OO
being	OO
in	OO
love	OO
is	OO
burned	OO
away	.O
and	OU
this	OO
is	OO
both	OO
an	OO
art	OO
and	OO
a	OO
fortunate	OO
accident	.O
your	OU
mother	OO
and	OO
i	OU
had	OO
it	.O
we	OU
had	OO
roots	OO
that	OO
grew	OO
towards	OO
each	OO
other	OO
underground	,O
and	OO
when	OO
all	OO
the	OO
pretty	OO
blossoms	OO
had	OO
fallen	OO
from	OO
our	OO
branches	,O
we	OO
discovered	OO
that	OO
we	OO
are	OO
one	OO
tree	OO
and	OO
not	OO
two	.O
that's	OU
what	OO
the	OO
heart	OO
yearns	OO
for	.O
the	OU
second	OO
thing	OO
you	OO
discover	OO
is	OO
your	OO
soul	.O
now	,U
i	OU
don't	OO
ask	OO
you	OO
to	OO
believe	OO
in	OO
god	OU
or	OO
not	OO
believe	OO
in	OO
god	,U
but	OO
i	OU
do	OO
ask	OO
you	OO
to	OO
believe	OO
that	OO
there's	OO
a	OO
piece	OO
of	OO
you	OO
that	OO
has	OO
no	OO
shape	,O
size	,O
color	OO
or	OO
weight	,O
but	OO
that	OO
gives	OO
you	OO
infinite	OO
dignity	OO
and	OO
value	.O
rich	OU
and	OO
successful	OO
people	OO
don't	OO
have	OO
more	OO
of	OO
this	OO
than	OO
less	OO
successful	OO
people	.O
slavery	OU
is	OO
wrong	OO
because	OO
it's	OO
an	OO
obliteration	OO
of	OO
another	OO
soul	.O
rape	OU
is	OO
not	OO
just	OO
an	OO
attack	OO
on	OO
a	OO
bunch	OO
of	OO
physical	OO
molecules	,O
it's	OO
an	OO
attempt	OO
to	OO
insult	OO
another	OO
person's	OO
soul	.O
and	OU
what	OO
the	OO
soul	OO
does	OO
is	OO
it	OO
yearns	OO
for	OO
righteousness	.O
the	OU
heart	OO
yearns	OO
for	OO
fusion	OO
with	OO
another	,O
the	OO
soul	OO
yearns	OO
for	OO
righteousness	.O
and	OU
that	OO
led	OO
to	OO
my	OO
third	OO
realization	,O
which	OO
i	OU
borrowed	OO
from	OO
einstein:	OU
the	OU
problem	OO
you	OO
have	OO
is	OO
not	OO
going	OO
to	OO
be	OO
solved	OO
at	OO
the	OO
level	OO
of	OO
consciousness	OO
on	OO
which	OO
you	OO
created	OO
it	.O
you	OU
have	OO
to	OO
expand	OO
to	OO
a	OO
different	OO
level	OO
of	OO
consciousness	.O
so	OU
what	OO
do	OO
you	OO
do	?O
well	,U
the	OO
first	OO
thing	OO
you	OO
do	OO
is	OO
you	OO
throw	OO
yourself	OO
on	OO
your	OO
friends	OO
and	OO
you	OO
have	OO
deeper	OO
conversations	OO
that	OO
you	OO
ever	OO
had	OO
before	.O
but	OU
the	OO
second	OO
thing	OO
you	OO
do	,O
you	OO
have	OO
to	OO
go	OO
out	OO
alone	OO
into	OO
the	OO
wilderness	.O
you	OU
go	OO
out	OO
into	OO
that	OO
place	OO
where	OO
there's	OO
nobody	OO
there	OO
to	OO
perform	,O
and	OO
the	OO
ego	OO
has	OO
nothing	OO
to	OO
do	,O
and	OO
it	OO
crumbles	,O
and	OO
only	OO
then	OO
are	OO
you	OO
capable	OO
of	OO
being	OO
loved	.O
i	OU
have	OO
a	OO
friend	OO
who	OO
said	OO
that	OO
when	OO
her	OO
daughter	OO
was	OO
born	,O
she	OO
realized	OO
that	OO
she	OO
loved	OO
her	OO
more	OO
than	OO
evolution	OO
required	.O
and	OU
i've	OU
always	OO
loved	OO
that	.O
because	OU
it	OO
talks	OO
about	OO
the	OO
peace	OO

my	OU

there's	OU
a	OO
woman	OO
named	OO

gordon	OU
who	OO
runs	OO
something	OO
called	OO
roots	OU
of	OO
empathy	.U
and	OU
what	OO
they	OO
do	OO
is	OO
they	OO
take	OO
a	OO
bunch	OO
of	OO
kids	,O
an	OO
eighth	OO
grade	OO
class	,O
they	OO
put	OO
a	OO
mom	OO
and	OO
an	OO
infant	,O
and	OO
then	OO
the	OO
students	OO
have	OO
to	OO
guess	OO
what	OO
the	OO
infant	OO
is	OO
thinking	,O
to	OO
teach	OO
empathy	.O
there	OU
was	OO
one	OO
kid	OO
in	OO
a	OO
class	OO
who	OO
was	OO
bigger	OO
than	OO
the	OO
rest	OO
because	OO
he'd	OO
been	OO
held	OO
back	,O
been	OO
through	OO
the	OO
foster	OO
care	OO
system	,O
seen	OO
his	OO
mom	OO
get	OO
killed	.O
and	OU
he	OO
wanted	OO
to	OO
hold	OO
the	OO
baby	.O
and	OU
the	OO
mom	OO
was	OO
nervous	OO
because	OO
he	OO
looked	OO
big	OO
and	OO
scary	.O
but	OU
she	OO
let	OO
this	OO
kid	,O
darren	,U
hold	OO
the	OO
baby	.O
he	OU
held	OO
it	,O
and	OO
he	OO
was	OO
great	OO
with	OO
it	.O
he	OU
gave	OO
the	OO
baby	OO
back	OO
and	OO
started	OO
asking	OO
questions	OO
about	OO
parenthood	.O
and	OU
his	OO
final	OO
question	OO
was	,O
if	OU
nobody	OO
has	OO
ever	OO
loved	OO
you	,O
do	OO
you	OO
think	OO
you	OO
can	OO
be	OO
a	OO
good	OO
father	?O
and	OU
so	OO
what	OO
roots	OU
of	OO
empathy	OU
does	OO
is	OO
they	OO
reach	OO
down	OO
and	OO
they	OO
grab	OO
people	OO
out	OO
of	OO
the	OO
valley	.O
and	OU
that's	OO
what	OO
weavers	OO
are	OO
doing	.O
some	OU
of	OO
them	OO
switch	OO
jobs	.O
some	OU
of	OO
them	OO
stay	OO
in	OO
their	OO
same	OO
jobs	.O
but	OU
one	OO
thing	OO
is	,O
they	OO
have	OO
an	OO
intensity	OO
to	OO
them	.O
i	OU
read	OO
this	OO
—	OO
e.o	.U
wilson	OU
wrote	OO
a	OO
great	OO
book	OO
called	OO
naturalist	,U
about	OO
his	OO
childhood	.O
when	OU
he	OO
was	OO
seven	,O
his	OO
parents	OO
were	OO

they	OO
sent	OO
him	OO
to	OO

he'd	OO
never	OO

a	OO

he	OU
wrote	,O
the	OU
creature	OO
was	OO
astonishing	.O
it	OU
existed	OO
beyond	OO
my	OO
imagination	.O
he	OU
was	OO
sitting	OO
on	OO
the	OO
dock	OO
one	OO
day	OO
and	OO
he	OO
saw	OO
a	OO
stingray	OO
float	OO
beneath	OO
his	OO
feet	.O
and	OU
at	OO
that	OO
moment	,O
a	OO
naturalist	OO
was	OO
born	OO
in	OO
the	OO
awe	OO
and	OO
wonder	.O
and	OU
he	OO
makes	OO
this	OO
observation:	OO
that	OO
when	OO
you're	OO
a	OO
child	,O
you	OO
see	OO
animals	OO
at	OO
twice	OO
the	OO
size	OO
as	OO
you	OO
do	OO
as	OO
an	OO
adult	.O
and	OU
that	OO
has	OO
always	OO
impressed	OO
me	,O
because	OO
what	OO
we	OO
want	OO
as	OO
kids	OO
is	OO
that	OO
moral	OO
intensity	,O
to	OO
be	OO
totally	OO
given	OO
ourselves	OO
over	OO
to	OO
something	OO
and	OO
to	OO
find	OO
that	OO
level	OO
of	OO
vocation	.O
and	OU
when	OO
you	OO
are	OO
around	OO
these	OO
weavers	,O
they	OO
see	OO
other	OO
people	OO
at	OO
twice	OO
the	OO
size	OO
as	OO
normal	OO
people	.O
they	OU
see	OO
deeper	OO
into	OO
them	.O
and	OU
what	OO
they	OO
see	OO
is	OO
joy	.O
on	OU
the	OO
first	OO
mountain	OO
of	OO
our	OO
life	,O
when	OO
we're	OO
shooting	OO
for	OO
our	OO
career	,O
we	OO
shoot	OO
for	OO
happiness	.O
and	OU
happiness	OO
is	OO
good	,O
it's	OO
the	OO
expansion	OO
of	OO
self	.O
you	OU
win	OO
a	OO
victory	,O
you	OO
get	OO
a	OO
promotion	,O
your	OO
team	OO
wins	OO
the	OO
super	OU
bowl	,U
you're	OO
happy	.O
joy	OU
is	OO
not	OO
the	OO
expansion	OO
of	OO
self	,O
it's	OO
the	OO
dissolving	OO
of	OO
self	.O
it's	OU
the	OO
moment	OO
when	OO
the	OO
skin	OO
barrier	OO
disappears	OO
between	OO
a	OO
mother	OO
and	OO
her	OO
child	,O
it's	OO
the	OO
moment	OO
when	OO
a	OO
naturalist	OO
feels	OO
just	OO
free	OO
in	OO
nature	.O
it's	OU
the	OO
moment	OO
where	OO
you're	OO
so	OO
lost	OO
in	OO
your	OO
work	OO
or	OO
a	OO
cause	,O
you	OO
have	OO
totally	OO
self	OO
forgotten	.O
and	OU
joy	OO
is	OO
a	OO
better	OO
thing	OO
to	OO
aim	OO
for	OO
than	OO
happiness	.O
i	OU
collect	OO
passages	OO
of	OO
joy	,O
of	OO
people	OO
when	OO
they	OO
lose	OO
it	.O
one	OU
of	OO
my	OO
favorite	OO
is	OO
from	OO
zadie	OU
smith	.U
in	OU
1999	,O
she	OO
was	OO
in	OO
a	OO
london	OU
nightclub	,O
looking	OO
for	OO
her	OO
friends	,O
wondering	OO
where	OO
her	OO
handbag	OO
was	.O
and	OU
suddenly	,O
as	OO
she	OO
writes,	.O
a	OO
rail	OO
thin	OO
man	OO
with	OO
enormous	OO
eyes	OO
reached	OO
across	OO
a	OO
sea	OO
of	OO
bodies	OO
for	OO
my	OO
hand	.O
he	OU
kept	OO
asking	OO
me	OO
the	OO
same	OO
thing	OO
over	OO
and	OO
over	,O
'are	OO
you	OO
feeling	OO
it?'	OO
my	OU
ridiculous	OO
heels	OO
were	OO
killing	OO
me	,O
i	OU
was	OO
terrified	OO
that	OO
i	OU
might	OO
die	,O
yet	OO
i	OU
felt	OO
simultaneously	OO
overwhelmed	OO
with	OO
delight	OO
that	OO
'can	OO
i	OU
kick	OU
it?'	OU
should	OO
happen	OO
to	OO
be	OO
playing	OO
on	OO
this	OO
precise	OO
moment	OO
in	OO
the	OO
history	OO
of	OO
the	OO
world	OO
on	OO
the	OO
sound	OO
system	,O
and	OO
it	OO
was	OO
now	OO
morphing	OO
into	OO
'teen	OO
spirit.'	OU
i	OU
took	OO
the	OO
man's	OO
hand	,O
the	OO
top	OO
of	OO
my	OO
head	OO
blew	OO
away	,O
we	OO
danced	,O
we	OO
danced	,O
we	OO
gave	OO
ourselves	OO
up	OO
to	OO
joy	.O
and	OU
so	OO
what	OO
i'm	OU
trying	OO
to	OO
describe	OO
is	OO
two	OO
different	OO
life	OO
mindsets	.O
the	OU
first	OO
mountain	OO
mindset	,O
which	OO
is	OO
about	OO
individual	OO
happiness	OO
and	OO
career	OO
success	.O
and	OU
it's	OO
a	OO
good	OO
mindset	,O
i	OU
have	OO
nothing	OO
against	OO
it	.O
but	OU
we're	OO
in	OO
a	OO
national	OO
valley	,O
because	OO
we	OO
don't	OO
have	OO
the	OO
other	OO
mindset	OO
to	OO
balance	OO
it	.O
we	OU
no	OO
longer	OO
feel	OO
good	OO
about	OO
ourselves	OO
as	OO
a	OO
people	,O
we've	OO
lost	OO
our	OO
defining	OO
faith	OO
in	OO
our	OO
future	,O
we	OO
don't	OO
see	OO
each	OO
other	OO
deeply	,O
we	OO
don't	OO
treat	OO
each	OO
other	OO
as	OO
well	.O
and	OU
we	OO
need	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
changes	.O
we	OU
need	OO
an	OO
economic	OO
change	OO
and	OO
environmental	OO
change	.O
but	OU
we	OO
also	OO
need	OO
a	OO
cultural	OO
and	OO
relational	OO
revolution	.O
we	OU
need	OO
to	OO
name	OO
the	OO
language	OO
of	OO
a	OO
recovered	OO
society	.O
and	OU
to	OO
me	,O
the	OO
weavers	OO
have	OO
found	OO
that	OO
language	.O
my	OU
theory	OO
of	OO
social	OO
change	OO
is	OO
that	OO
society	OO
changes	OO
when	OO
a	OO
small	OO
group	OO
of	OO
people	OO
find	OO
a	OO
better	OO
way	OO
to	OO
live	,O
and	OO
the	OO
rest	OO
of	OO
us	OO
copy	OO
them	.O
and	OU
these	OO
weavers	OO
have	OO
found	OO
a	OO
better	OO
way	OO
to	OO
live	.O
and	OU
you	OO
don't	OO
have	OO
to	OO
theorize	OO
about	OO
it	.O
they	OU
are	OO
out	OO
there	OO
as	OO
community	OO
builders	OO
all	OO
around	OO
the	OO
country	.O
we	OU
just	OO
have	OO
to	OO
shift	OO
our	OO
lives	OO
a	OO
little	,O
so	OO
we	OO
can	OO
say	,O
i'm	OU
a	OO
weaver	,O
we're	OO
a	OO
weaver	.O
and	OU
if	OO
we	OO
do	OO
that	,O
the	OO
hole	OO
inside	OO
ourselves	OO
gets	OO
filled	,O
but	OO
more	OO
important	,O
the	OO
social	OO
unity	OO
gets	OO
repaired	.O
thank	OU
you	OO
very	OO
much	.O
i	OU
want	OO
to	OO
talk	OO
today	OO
about	OO
how	OO
reading	OO
can	OO
change	OO
our	OO
lives	OO
and	OO
about	OO
the	OO
limits	OO
of	OO
that	OO
change	.O
i	OU
want	OO
to	OO
talk	OO
to	OO
you	OO
about	OO
how	OO
reading	OO
can	OO
give	OO
us	OO
a	OO
shareable	OO
world	OO
of	OO
powerful	OO
human	OO
connection	.O
but	OU
also	OO
about	OO
how	OO
that	OO
connection	OO
is	OO
always	OO
partial	.O
how	OU
reading	OO
is	OO
ultimately	OO
a	OO
lonely	,O
idiosyncratic	OO
undertaking	.O
the	OU
writer	OO
who	OO
changed	OO
my	OO
life	OO
was	OO
the	OO
great	OO
african	OU
american	OU
novelist	OO
james	OU
baldwin	.U
when	OU
i	OU
was	OO
growing	OO
up	OO
in	OO
western	OU
michigan	OU
in	OO
the	OO
1980s	,O
there	OO
weren't	OO
many	OO
asian	OU
american	OU
writers	OO
interested	OO
in	OO
social	OO
change	.O
and	OU
so	OO
i	OU
think	OO
i	OU
turned	OO
to	OO
james	OU
baldwin	OU
as	OO
a	OO
way	OO
to	OO
fill	OO
this	OO
void	,O
as	OO
a	OO
way	OO
to	OO
feel	OO
racially	OO
conscious	.O
but	OU
perhaps	OO
because	OO
i	OU
knew	OO
i	OU
wasn't	OO
myself	OO
african	OU
american	,U
i	OU
also	OO
felt	OO
challenged	OO
and	OO
indicted	OO
by	OO
his	OO
words	.O
especially	OU
these	OO
words:	OO
there	OU
are	OO
liberals	OO
who	OO
have	OO
all	OO
the	OO
proper	OO
attitudes	,O
but	OO
no	OO
real	OO
convictions	.O
when	OU
the	OO
chips	OO
are	OO
down	OO
and	OO
you	OO
somehow	OO
expect	OO
them	OO
to	OO

they	OO

they	OU

this	OU

the	OO

where	OO
i	OU

patrick	.U
he	OU

15	OO

held	OO
back	OO
twice	,O
he	OO
was	OO
in	OO
the	OO
eighth	OO

he	OU
was	OO
quiet	,O
introspective	,O
like	OO
he	OO
was	OO
always	OO
in	OO
deep	OO
thought	.O
and	OU
he	OO
hated	OO
seeing	OO
other	OO
people	OO
fight	.O
i	OU
saw	OO
him	OO
once	OO
jump	OO
between	OO
two	OO
girls	OO
when	OO
they	OO
got	OO
into	OO
a	OO
fight	OO
and	OO
he	OO
got	OO
himself	OO
knocked	OO
to	OO
the	OO
ground	.O
patrick	OU
had	OO
just	OO
one	OO
problem	.O
he	OU
wouldn't	OO
come	OO
to	OO
school	.O
he	OU
said	OO
that	OO
sometimes	OO
school	OO
was	OO
just	OO
too	OO
depressing	OO
because	OO
people	OO
were	OO
always	OO
fighting	OO
and	OO
teachers	OO
were	OO
quitting	.O
and	OU
also	,O
his	OO
mother	OO
worked	OO
two	OO
jobs	OO
and	OO
was	OO
just	OO
too	OO
tired	OO
to	OO
make	OO
him	OO
come	.O
so	OU
i	OU
made	OO
it	OO
my	OO
job	OO
to	OO
get	OO
him	OO
to	OO
come	OO
to	OO
school	.O
and	OU
because	OO
i	OU
was	OO
crazy	OO
and	OO
22	OO
and	OO
zealously	OO
optimistic	,O
my	OO
strategy	OO
was	OO
just	OO
to	OO
show	OO
up	OO
at	OO
his	OO
house	OO
and	OO
say	,O
hey	,U
why	OO
don't	OO
you	OO
come	OO
to	OO
school	?O
and	OU
this	OO
strategy	OO
actually	OO
worked	,O
he	OO
started	OO
to	OO
come	OO
to	OO
school	OO
every	OO
day	.O
and	OU
he	OO
started	OO
to	OO
flourish	OO
in	OO
my	OO
class	.O
he	OU
was	OO
writing	OO
poetry	,O
he	OO
was	OO
reading	OO
books	.O
he	OU
was	OO
coming	OO
to	OO
school	OO
every	OO

around	OU
the	OO
same	OO
time	OO
that	OO
i	OU
had	OO
figured	OO
out	OO
how	OO
to	OO
connect	OO
to	OO
patrick	,U
i	OU
got	OO
into	OO
law	OO
school	OO
at	OO
harvard	.U
i	OU
once	OO
again	OO
faced	OO
this	OO
question	,O
where	OO
should	OO
i	OU
put	OO
myself	,O
where	OO
do	OO
i	OU
put	OO
my	OO
body	?O
and	OU
i	OU
thought	OO
to	OO
myself	OO
that	OO
the	OO
mississippi	OU
delta	OU
was	OO
a	OO
place	OO
where	OO
people	OO
with	OO
money	,O
people	OO
with	OO
opportunity	,O
those	OO
people	OO
leave	.O
and	OU
the	OO
people	OO
who	OO
stay	OO
behind	OO
are	OO
the	OO
people	OO
who	OO
don't	OO
have	OO
the	OO
chance	OO
to	OO
leave	.O
i	OU
didn't	OO
want	OO
to	OO
be	OO
a	OO
person	OO
who	OO
left	.O
i	OU
wanted	OO
to	OO
be	OO
a	OO
person	OO
who	OO
stayed	.O
on	OU
the	OO
other	OO
hand	,O
i	OU
was	OO
lonely	OO
and	OO
tired	.O
and	OU
so	OO
i	OU
convinced	OO
myself	OO
that	OO
i	OU
could	OO
do	OO
more	OO
change	OO
on	OO
a	OO
larger	OO
scale	OO
if	OO
i	OU
had	OO
a	OO
prestigious	OO
law	OO
degree	.O
so	OU
i	OU
left	.O
three	OU
years	OO
later	,O
when	OO
i	OU
was	OO
about	OO
to	OO
graduate	OO
from	OO
law	OO
school	,O
my	OO
friend	OO
called	OO
me	OO
and	OO
told	OO
me	OO
that	OO
patrick	OU
had	OO
got	OO
into	OO
a	OO
fight	OO
and	OO
killed	OO
someone	.O
i	OU
was	OO
devastated	.O
part	OU
of	OO
me	OO
didn't	OO
believe	OO
it	,O
but	OO
part	OO
of	OO
me	OO
also	OO
knew	OO
that	OO
it	OO
was	OO
true	.O
i	OU
flew	OO
down	OO
to	OO
see	OO
patrick	.U
i	OU
visited	OO
him	OO
in	OO
jail	.O
and	OU
he	OO
told	OO
me	OO
that	OO
it	OO
was	OO
true	.O
that	OU
he	OO
had	OO
killed	OO
someone	.O
and	OU
he	OO
didn't	OO
want	OO
to	OO
talk	OO
more	OO
about	OO
it	.O
i	OU
asked	OO
him	OO
what	OO
had	OO
happened	OO
with	OO
school	OO
and	OO
he	OO
said	OO
that	OO
he	OO
had	OO
dropped	OO
out	OO
the	OO
year	OO
after	OO
i	OU
left	.O
and	OU
then	OO
he	OO
wanted	OO
to	OO
tell	OO
me	OO
something	OO
else	.O
he	OU
looked	OO
down	OO
and	OO
he	OO
said	OO
that	OO
he	OO
had	OO
had	OO
a	OO
baby	OO
daughter	OO
who	OO
was	OO
just	OO
born	.O
and	OU
he	OO
felt	OO
like	OO
he	OO
had	OO
let	OO
her	OO
down	.O
that	OU
was	OO
it	,O
our	OO
conversation	OO
was	OO
rushed	OO
and	OO
awkward	.O
when	OU
i	OU
stepped	OO
outside	OO
the	OO
jail	,O
a	OO
voice	OO
inside	OO
me	OO
said	,O
come	OU
back	.O
if	OU
you	OO
don't	OO
come	OO
back	OO
now	,O
you'll	OO
never	OO
come	OO
back	.O
so	OU
i	OU
graduated	OO
from	OO
law	OO
school	OO
and	OO
i	OU
went	OO
back	.O
i	OU
went	OO
back	OO
to	OO
see	OO
patrick	,U
i	OU
went	OO
back	OO
to	OO
see	OO
if	OO
i	OU
could	OO
help	OO
him	OO
with	OO
his	OO
legal	OO
case	.O
and	OU
this	OO
time	,O
when	OO
i	OU
saw	OO
him	OO
a	OO
second	OO
time	,O
i	OU
thought	OO
i	OU
had	OO
this	OO
great	OO
idea	,O
i	OU
said	,O
hey	,U
patrick	,U
why	OO
don't	OO
you	OO
write	OO
a	OO
letter	OO
to	OO
your	OO
daughter	,O
so	OO
that	OO
you	OO
can	OO
keep	OO
her	OO
on	OO
your	OO
mind	?O
and	OU
i	OU
handed	OO
him	OO
a	OO
pen	OO
and	OO
a	OO
piece	OO
of	OO
paper	,O
and	OO
he	OO
started	OO
to	OO
write	.O
but	OU
when	OO
i	OU
saw	OO
the	OO
paper	OO
that	OO
he	OO
handed	OO
back	OO
to	OO
me	,O
i	OU
was	OO
shocked	.O
i	OU
didn't	OO
recognize	OO
his	OO
handwriting	,O
he	OO
had	OO
made	OO
simple	OO
spelling	OO
mistakes	.O
and	OU
i	OU
thought	OO
to	OO
myself	OO
that	OO
as	OO
a	OO
teacher	,O
i	OU
knew	OO
that	OO
a	OO
student	OO
could	OO
dramatically	OO
improve	OO
in	OO
a	OO
very	OO
quick	OO
amount	OO
of	OO
time	,O
but	OO
i	OU
never	OO
thought	OO
that	OO
a	OO
student	OO
could	OO
dramatically	OO
regress	.O
what	OU
even	OO
pained	OO
me	OO
more	,O
was	OO
seeing	OO
what	OO
he	OO
had	OO
written	OO
to	OO
his	OO
daughter	.O
he	OU
had	OO
written	,O
i'm	OU
sorry	OO
for	OO
my	OO
mistakes	,O
i'm	OU
sorry	OO
for	OO
not	OO
being	OO
there	OO
for	OO
you	.O
and	OU
this	OO
was	OO
all	OO
he	OO
felt	OO
he	OO
had	OO
to	OO
say	OO
to	OO
her	.O
and	OU
i	OU
asked	OO
myself	OO
how	OO
can	OO
i	OU
convince	OO
him	OO
that	OO
he	OO
has	OO
more	OO
to	OO
say	,O
parts	OO
of	OO
himself	OO
that	OO
he	OO
doesn't	OO
need	OO
to	OO
apologize	OO
for	.O
i	OU
wanted	OO
him	OO
to	OO
feel	OO
that	OO
he	OO
had	OO
something	OO
worthwhile	OO
to	OO
share	OO
with	OO
his	OO
daughter	.O
for	OU
every	OO
day	OO
the	OO
next	OO
seven	OO
months	,O
i	OU
visited	OO
him	OO
and	OO
brought	OO
books	.O
my	OU
tote	OO
bag	OO
became	OO
a	OO
little	OO
library	.O
i	OU
brought	OO
james	OU
baldwin	,U
i	OU
brought	OO
walt	OU
whitman	,U
c.s	.U
lewis	.U
i	OU
brought	OO
guidebooks	OO
to	OO
trees	,O
to	OO
birds	,O
and	OO
what	OO
would	OO
become	OO
his	OO
favorite	OO
book	,O
the	OO
dictionary	.O
on	OU
some	OO
days	,O
we	OO
would	OO
sit	OO
for	OO
hours	OO
in	OO
silence	,O
both	OO
of	OO
us	OO
reading	.O
and	OU
on	OO
other	OO
days	,O
we	OO
would	OO
read	OO
together	,O
we	OO
would	OO
read	OO
poetry	.O
we	OU
started	OO
by	OO
reading	OO
haikus	,O
hundreds	OO
of	OO
haikus	,O
a	OO
deceptively	OO
simple	OO
masterpiece	.O
and	OU
i	OU
would	OO
ask	OO
him	,O
share	OU
with	OO
me	OO
your	OO
favorite	OO
haikus	.O
and	OU
some	OO
of	OO
them	OO
are	OO
quite	OO
funny	.O
so	OU
there's	OO
this	OO
by	OO
issa:	OU
don't	OU
worry	,O
spiders	,O
i	OU
keep	OO
house	OO
casually	.O
and	OU
this:	OO

half	OO
the	OO
day	,O
no	OO
one	OO
punished	OO
me	.O
and	OU
this	OO
gorgeous	OO
one	,O
which	OO
is	OO
about	OO
the	OO

of	OO
snow	OO
falling	,O
deer	OU
licking	OO
first	OO
frost	OO
from	OO
each	OO
other's	OO

there's	OU
something	OO
mysterious	OO
and	OO
gorgeous	OO
just	OO
about	OO
the	OO
way	OO
a	OO
poem	OO
looks	.O
the	OU
empty	OO
space	OO
is	OO
as	OO
important	OO
as	OO
the	OO
words	OO
themselves	.O
we	OU
read	OO
this	OO
poem	OO
by	OO
w.s	.U
merwin	,U
which	OO
he	OO
wrote	OO
after	OO
he	OO
saw	OO
his	OO
wife	OO
working	OO
in	OO
the	OO
garden	OO
and	OO
realized	OO
that	OO
they	OO
would	OO
spend	OO
the	OO
rest	OO
of	OO
their	OO
lives	OO
together	.O
let	OU
me	OO
imagine	OO
that	OO
we	OO
will	OO
come	OO
again	OO
when	OO
we	OO
want	OO
to	OO
and	OO
it	OO
will	OO
be	OO
spring	OO
we	OU
will	OO
be	OO
no	OO
older	OO
than	OO
we	OO
ever	OO
were	OO
the	OU
worn	OO
griefs	OO
will	OO
have	OO
eased	OO
like	OO
the	OO
early	OO
cloud	OO
through	OO
which	OO
morning	OO
slowly	OO
comes	OO
to	OO
itself	OO
i	OU
asked	OO
patrick	OU
what	OO
his	OO
favorite	OO
line	OO
was	,O
and	OO
he	OO
said	,O
we	OU
will	OO
be	OO
no	OO
older	OO
than	OO
we	OO
ever	OO
were	.O
he	OU
said	OO
it	OO
reminded	OO
him	OO
of	OO
a	OO
place	OO
where	OO
time	OO
just	OO
stops	,O
where	OO
time	OO
doesn't	OO
matter	OO
anymore	.O
and	OU
i	OU
asked	OO
him	OO
if	OO
he	OO
had	OO
a	OO
place	OO
like	OO
that	,O
where	OO
time	OO
lasts	OO
forever	.O
and	OU
he	OO
said	,O
my	OU
mother	.O
when	OU
you	OO
read	OO
a	OO
poem	OO
alongside	OO
someone	OO
else	,O
the	OO
poem	OO
changes	OO
in	OO
meaning	.O
because	OU
it	OO
becomes	OO
personal	OO
to	OO
that	OO
person	,O
becomes	OO
personal	OO
to	OO
you	.O
we	OU
then	OO
read	OO
books	,O
we	OO
read	OO
so	OO
many	OO
books	,O
we	OO
read	OO
the	OO
memoir	OO
of	OO
frederick	OU
douglass	,U
an	OO
american	OU
slave	OO
who	OO
taught	OO
himself	OO
to	OO

and	OO
who	OO
escaped	OO
to	OO
freedom	OO
because	OO
of	OO
his	OO
literacy	.O
i	OU
had	OO
grown	OO
up	OO
thinking	OO
of	OO
frederick	OU
douglass	OU
as	OO
a	OO
hero	OO
and	OO
i	OU
thought	OO
of	OO
this	OO
story	OO
as	OO
one	OO
of	OO
uplift	OO
and	OO
hope	.O
but	OU
this	OO
book	OO
put	OO
patrick	OU
in	OO
a	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
panic	.O
he	OU

on	OO
a	OO
story	OO
douglass	OU

of	OO
how	,O
over	OO
christmas	,U
masters	OO

as	OO
a	OO
way	OO
to	OO
prove	OO
to	OO
them	OO
that	OO
they	OO
can't	OO

freedom	.O
because	OU

would	OO

stumbling	OO
on	OO
the	OO
fields	.O
patrick	OU
said	OO
he	OO
related	OO
to	OO
this	.O
he	OU
said	OO
that	OO
there	OO
are	OO
people	OO
in	OO
jail	OO
who	,O
like	OO

don't	OO
want	OO
to	OO

about	OO
their	OO

because	OO
it's	OO
too	OO
painful	.O
too	OU
painful	OO
to	OO

about	OO
the	OO

too	OO
painful	OO
to	OO
think	OO
about	OO
how	OO
far	OO
we	OO
have	OO
to	OO

his	OU

this	OO

anything	,U
no	OO

it	OU

this	OO

that	OO

patrick	OU

that	OO

brave	OO
to	OO

to	OO

patrick	OU
would	OO

it	OO
in	OO
a	OO

in	OO

to	OO

patrick's	OU
the	OO
one	OO
who	OO

and	OO
i	OU

never	OO

a	OO

i	OU
thought	OO
about	OO
this	OO

a	OO

what	OO
i	OU
want	OO
to	OO
say	OO
is	OO
that	OO
this	OO
story	OO
is	OO
not	OO
just	OO
about	OO
patrick	.U
it's	OU
about	OO
us	,O
it's	OO
about	OO
the	OO

the	OU

that	OO
patrick	OU

out	OO

in	OU
this	OO

i	OU
represent	OO
that	OO

and	OU
in	OO
telling	OO
this	OO

i	OU
didn't	OO
want	OO
to	OO
hide	OO

hide	OU
the	OO
power	OO
that	OO
i	OU

in	OU
telling	OO
this	OO

i	OU
wanted	OO
to	OO
expose	OO
that	OO

and	OO
then	OO
to	OO
ask	,O
how	OO
do	OO
we	OO
diminish	OO
the	OO
distance	OO
between	OO
us	?O
reading	OU
is	OO
one	OO
way	OO
to	OO
close	OO
that	OO
distance	.O
it	OU
gives	OO
us	OO
a	OO
quiet	OO
universe	OO
that	OO
we	OO
can	OO
share	OO
together	,O
that	OO
we	OO
can	OO

in	OO
equally	.O
you're	OU
probably	OO
wondering	OO
now	OO
what	OO
happened	OO
to	OO
patrick	.U
did	OU
reading	OO
save	OO
his	OO
life	?O
it	OU
did	OO
and	OO
it	OO
didn't	.O
when	OU
patrick	OU
got	OO
out	OO
of	OO
prison	,O
his	OO
journey	OO
was	OO
excruciating	.O
employers	OU
turned	OO
him	OO
away	OO
because	OO
of	OO
his	OO

his	OO
best	OO
friend	,O
his	OO
mother	,O
died	OO
at	OO
age	OO
43	OO
from	OO
heart	OO
disease	OO
and	OO
diabetes	.O
he's	OU
been	OO
homeless	,O
he's	OO
been	OO
hungry	.O
so	OU
people	OO
say	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
things	OO
about	OO
reading	OO
that	OO

exaggerated	OO
to	OO
me	.O
being	OU

him	OO
form	OO
being	OO

it	OU
didn't	OO
stop	OO
his	OO

from	OO

so	OU
what	OO
can	OO
reading	OO
do	?O
i	OU
have	OO
a	OO
few	OO
answers	OO
to	OO
end	OO
with	OO
today	.O
reading	OU

his	OO

with	OO

him	OO

that	OO

how	OU

a	OO

of	OO

that's	OO
why	OO

the	OU

when	OU

the	OU

to	OO

for	OO

of	OO
these	OO

headlines	.O
keep	OU
watching	OO
for	OO
the	OO
explanation	OO
of	OO
the	OO
first	OO

then	OO
pause	OO
at	OO
the	OO
headline	OO
to	OO
answer	OO
the	OO
question	.O
these	OU
are	OO
simplified	OO
scenarios	.O
a	OU
real	OO
study	OO
would	OO
detail	OO
many	OO
more	OO
factors	OO
and	OO
how	OO
it	OO
accounted	OO
for	OO
them	,O
but	OO
for	OO
the	OO
purposes	OO
of	OO
this	OO
exercise	,O
assume	OO
all	OO
the	OO
information	OO
you	OO
need	OO

let’s	OU
start	OO
by	OO
considering	OO
the	OO
cardiovascular	OO
effects	OO
of	OO
a	OO
certain	OO
vitamin	,O
healthium	.U
the	OU
study	OO
finds	OO
that	OO
participants	OO
taking	OO
healthium	OU
had	OO
a	OO
higher	OO
level	OO
of	OO
healthy	OO
cholesterol	OO
than	OO
those	OO
taking	OO
a	OO
placebo	.O
their	OU
levels	OO
became	OO
similar	OO
to	OO
those	OO
of	OO
people	OO
with	OO
naturally	OO
high	OO
levels	OO
of	OO
this	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
cholesterol	.O
previous	OU
research	OO
has	OO
shown	OO
that	OO

with	OO
naturally	OO
high	OO
levels	OO
of	OO
healthy	OO
cholesterol	OO
have	OO
lower	OO
rates	OO
of	OO
heart	OO

so	OU
what	OO
makes	OO
this	OO
headline	OO
misleading:	OO
healthium	OU
reduces	OO
risk	OO
of	OO
heart	OO
disease	.O
the	OU
problem	OO
with	OO
this	OO
headline	OO
is	OO
that	OO
the	OO
research	OO
didn’t	OO
actually	OO
investigate	OO
whether	OO
healthium	OU
reduces	OO
heart	OO
disease	.O
it	OU
only	OO
measured	OO
healthium’s	OU
impact	OO
on	OO
levels	OO

the	OU
fact	OO
that	OO

high	OO
levels	OO
of	OO
that	OO

lower	OO
risk	OO
of	OO

attacks	OO
doesn’t	OO

that	OO

will	OO
be	OO
true	OO
of	OO

who	OO
elevate	OO
their	OO

using	OO

now	OU
that	OO
you’ve	OO

the	OO

try	OO
your	OO

at	OO
a	OO

the	OO

this	OU

the	OO

what’s	OU
wrong	OO
with	OO
this	OO
headline:	OO

in	OO

it’s	OU
a	OO

draw	OO
a	OO
conclusion	OO
about	OO
students	OO
in	OO
general	OO
from	OO
a	OO
sample	OO
of	OO

that’s	OU
because	OO
the	OO
fewer	OO

the	OO
less	OO

it	OO

if	OO
the	OO
broader	OO
population	OO
of	OO

is	OO
half	OO
male	OO

the	OO

a	OO

about	OO

a	OO

that	OO

the	OO

similarly	,U

each	OO

a	OO

there	OO

the	OU

is	OO

it’s	OO

we’ve	OU

into	OO
account	OO
how	OO
one	OO
area	OO
affects	OO
another	.O
then	,U
there's	OO
the	OO
issue	OO
of	OO
getting	OO
everyone	OO
on	OO
board	.O
coastal	OU
economies	OO
often	OO
rely	OO
on	OO
fishing	OO
and	OO
tourism	.O
if	OU
people	OO
think	OO
they	OO
can't	OO
do	OO
their	OO
work	,O
there's	OO
no	OO
chance	OO
of	OO
getting	OO
the	OO
local	OO
buy	OO
in	OO
you	OO
need	OO
for	OO
the	OO
area	OO
to	OO
be	OO
successful	.O
marine	OU
protected	OO
areas	OO
must	OO
also	OO
be	OO
enforced	.O
that	OU
means	OO
the	OO
government	OO
itself	OO
must	OO
be	OO
deeply	OO
invested	OO
in	OO
the	OO
plan	.O
token	OU
support	OO
will	OO
not	OO
cut	OO
it	.O
and	OU
finally	,O
conservation	OO
requires	OO
money	.O
a	OU
lot	OO
of	OO
it	.O
governments	OU
in	OO
island	OO
and	OO
coastal	OO
nations	OO
may	OO
want	OO
to	OO
protect	OO
their	OO
waters	,O
but	OO
often	OO
these	OO
nations	OO
have	OO
very	OO
high	OO
debt	OO
and	OO
can't	OO
afford	OO
to	OO
prioritize	OO
conservation	.O
if	OU
we	OO
rely	OO
on	OO
philanthropic	OO
dollars	OO
alone	OO
to	OO
fund	OO
marine	OO
protection	,O
we	OO
might	OO
get	OO
a	OO
small	OO
marine	OO
protected	OO
area	OO
here	,O
another	OO
little	OO
one	OO
there	.O
but	OU
we	OO
need	OO
more	OO
marine	OO
protected	OO
areas	OO
faster	,O
to	OO
have	OO
lasting	OO
impact	.O
so	OU
what	OO
exactly	OO
does	OO
smart	OO
ocean	OO
conservation	OO
look	OO
like	?O
how	OU
do	OO
we	OO
get	OO
the	OO
money	,O
government	OO
support	OO
and	OO
careful	OO
planning	OO
that	OO
takes	OO
into	OO
account	OO
both	OO
local	OO
economies	OO
and	OO
complex	OO
ecosystems	?O
we	OU
want	OO
to	OO
share	OO
with	OO
you	OO
an	OO
audacious	OO
idea	OO
from	OO
the	OU
nature	OU
conservancy	.U
it	OU
seeks	OO
to	OO
address	OO
all	OO
of	OO
these	OO
things	OO
in	OO
one	OO
fell	OO
swoop	.O
they've	OU
realized	OO
that	OO
debt	OO
held	OO
by	OO
island	OO
and	OO
coastal	OO
nations	OO
is	OO
the	OO
very	OO
thing	OO
that	OO
will	OO
enable	OO
them	OO
to	OO
achieve	OO
their	OO
conservation	OO
goals	.O
tnc's	OU
idea	OO
is	OO
to	OO
restructure	OO
this	OO
debt	,O
to	OO
generate	OO
the	OO
funds	OO
and	OO
political	OO
will	OO
to	OO
protect	OO
reefs	,O
mangroves	OO
and	OO
fisheries	.O
for	OU
example	,O
if	OO
you	OO
refinance	OO
your	OO
house	OO
to	OO
take	OO
advantage	OO
of	OO
a	OO
better	OO
interest	OO
rate	,O
maybe	OO
you	OO
use	OO
the	OO
savings	OO
to	OO
insulate	OO
your	OO
attic	.O
that's	OU
what	OO
blue	OU
bonds	OU
for	OO
conservation	OU
do	OO
for	OO
entire	OO
coastal	OO
countries	.O
refinance	OU
the	OO
debt	,O
then	OO
use	OO
the	OO
savings	OO
to	OO
create	OO
marine	OO
protected	OO
areas	.O
of	OU
course	,O
sovereign	OO
debt	OO
restructuring	OO
is	OO
more	OO
complicated	OO
than	OO
that	,O
but	OO
you	OO
get	OO
the	OO
basic	OO
idea	.O
if	OU
investors	OO
put	OO
in	OO
40	OO
million	OO
dollars	OO
now	,O
it	OO
can	OO
unlock	OO
as	OO
much	OO
as	OO
1.6	OO
billion	OO
for	OO
ocean	OO
conservation	.O
and	OU
this	OO
is	OO
how	OO
the	OO
work	OO
gets	OO
done	.O
step	OU
one:	OO
negotiate	OO
the	OO
deal	.O
a	OU
coastal	OO
nation	OO
commits	OO
to	OO
protect	OO
at	OO
least	OO
30	OO
percent	OO
of	OO
its	OO
ocean	OO
areas	.O
in	OU
exchange	,O
the	OU
nature	OU
conservancy	OU
bring	OO
investors	,O
public	OO
funders	OO
and	OO
international	OO
development	OO
organizations	OO
to	OO
the	OO
table	OO
to	OO
restructure	OO
a	OO
portion	OO
of	OO
the	OO
nation's	OO
debt	,O
leading	OO
to	OO
lower	OO
interest	OO
rates	OO
and	OO
longer	OO

periods	.O
step	OU
two:	OO
create	OO
a	OO
marine	OO
plan	.O
simultaneously	,U
the	OU
nature	OU

works	OO
with	OO
marine	OO
scientists	,O

and	OO
local	OO

to	OO
create	OO
a	OO
detailed	OO

that	OO
integrates	OO
the	OO
needs	OO
of	OO
the	OO
ocean	OO
with	OO
the	OO
needs	OO
of	OO
the	OO
people	.O
step	OU
three:	OO
activate	OO
for	OO
longevity	.O
tnc	OU
establishes	OO
an	OO
independently	OO
run	OO
conservation	OO
trust	OO
fund	.O
the	OU

into	OO
it	OO
to	OO
support	OO

the	OU
trust	OO
then	OO
holds	OO
the	OO

ensuring	OO
that	OO

to	OO

30	OO

today	,U
the	OO

is	OO
on	OO
track	OO
to	OO
protect	OO
400,000	OO
square	OO
kilometers	OO
of	OO
ocean	.O
that's	OU
an	OO
area	OO
roughly	OO
the	OO
size	OO
of	OO
germany	.U
the	OU
seychelles	OU
is	OO
protecting	OO
its	OO
coral	OO

it's	OO
replenishing	OO
its	OO
fisheries	,O
it's	OO
improving	OO
its	OO
resilience	OO
to	OO
climate	OO
change	.O
at	OU
the	OO
same	OO
time	,O
it's	OO
strengthening	OO
its	OO
economy	.O
this	OU
success	OO
is	OO
making	OO
other	OO
governments	OO
take	OO
note	.O
many	OU
want	OO
to	OO
be	OO
part	OO
of	OO
this	.O
there's	OU
an	OO
opportunity	OO
to	OO
scale	OO
this	OO
up	,O
dramatically	.O
and	OU
fast	.O
tnc	OU
has	OO
identified	OO
20	OO
more	OO
nations	OO
where	OO
such	OO
a	OO
plan	OO
should	OO
be	OO
possible	.O
but	OU
to	OO
execute	,O
they	OO
need	OO
seed	OO
capital	.O
and	OU
to	OO
put	OO
in	OO
place	OO
local	OO
teams	OO
who	OO
can	OO
develop	OO
conservation	OO
plans	,O
work	OO
with	OO
all	OO
the	OO

and	OO
structure	OO
the	OO

if	OU
they	OO
get	OO
the	OO
support	OO
they	OO
need	OO
over	OO
the	OO
next	OO
five	OO
years	,O
they	OO
could	OO
protect	OO
four	OO
million	OO
square	OO
kilometers	OO
of	OO
ocean	.O
that's	OU
10	OO
germanies	.U
this	OU
would	OO
increase	OO
the	OO
amount	OO
of	OO
protected	OO
areas	OO
in	OO
all	OO
of	OO
the	OO
world's	OO
oceans	OO
by	OO
an	OO
incredible	OO
15	OO
percent	.O
it	OU
would	OO
allow	OO
vast	OO
tracks	OO
of	OO
the	OO
world's	OO
coral	OO
reefs	OO
to	OO
replenish	OO
and	OO
give	OO
safe	OO
harbor	OO
to	OO
countless	OO
species	.O
this	OU
would	OO
be	OO
truly	OO
incredible	.O
and	OU
it's	OO
really	OO
just	OO
the	OO
beginning	.O
because	OU
there	OO
aren't	OO
20	OO
countries	OO
in	OO
the	OO
world	OO
where	OO
this	OO
kind	OO
of	OO

would	OO
work	.O
there	OU
are	OO
almost	OO
100	.O
with	OU
this	OO
approach	,O
everyone	OO
wins	.O
governments	,U
local	OO
citizens	,O

and	OO
most	OO
importantly	,O
our	OO
oceans	.O
so	OU
in	OO
fact	,O
we	OO
all	OO
win	.O
ah	,U
earth's	OO
oceans	.O
when	OU
i	OU
was	OO
a	OO
kid	,O
i	OU
was	OO
afraid	OO
of	OO
the	OO
dark	.O
the	OU
darkness	OO
is	OO
where	OO
the	OO
monsters	OO
are	.O
and	OU
i	OU
had	OO
this	OO
little	OO
night	OO
light	OO
outside	OO

so	OO
that	OO
it	OO
would	OO
never	OO

too	OO
dark	.O
but	OU
over	OO
time	,O
my	OO
fear	OO
of	OO
the	OO
dark	OO
turned	OO
to	OO
curiosity	.O
what	OU
is	OO
out	OO
there	OO
in	OO
the	OO
dark	OO
dark	?O
and	OU
it	OO
turns	OO
out	OO
that	OO

is	OO
something	OO
that's	OO
fascinated	OO
humans	OO
for	OO
thousands	OO
of	OO
years	,O
maybe	OO
forever	.O
and	OU
we	OO
know	OO
this	OO
because	OO
we	OO
find	OO
their	OO
ancient	OO
relics	OO
of	OO
their	OO
attempts	OO
to	OO

the	OO

this	OU

over	OO
30,000	OO

some	OU
people	OO

that	OO
it's	OO
a	OO
carving	OO
of	OO

or	OO
maybe	OO
a	OO
calendar	.O
we	OU
don't	OO

the	OU

over	OO
6,000	OO
years	OO
old	,O
and	OO
it's	OO
from	OO
a	OO

that's	OO

to	OO

the	OO
big	OU

maybe	.U
the	OU
nebra	OU

is	OO
uncontroversial	.O
you	OU
don't	OO
have	OO
to	OO
be	OO
an	OO
astronomer	OO
to	OO
know	OO
that	OO
you're	OO
looking	OO
at	OO
the	OO
moon	OU

or	OO
the	OO

in	OO

and	OU
that	OO
little	OO
group	OO
of	OO
seven	OO

that's	OO
the	OO
pleiades	,U
the	OO
seven	OU

but	OU
in	OO
any	OO
case	,O
the	OO
point	OO
is	OO
clear:	OO
astronomers	OO
have	OO
been	OO
mapping	OO
the	OO
sky	OO
for	OO
a	OO
long	OO
time	.O
why	?U
it's	OU
our	OO
calling	OO

as	OO
a	OO

in	OO
the	OO

to	OO
figure	OO

we	OO

we	OO

but	OU
it's	OO
not	OO
easy	.O
understanding	OU
the	OO
universe	OO
is	OO
battle	.O
it	OU
is	OO
unrelenting	,O
it	OO
is	OO
time	OO

and	OO
it	OO
is	OO
one	OO
we	OO

it	OU

a	OO

you	OO
need	OO
to	OO
know	OO
the	OO
battlefield	.O
so	OU
at	OO
its	OO
core	,O
mapping	OO
the	OO
sky	OO
involves	OO
three	OO
essential	OO
elements	.O
you've	OU
got	OO
objects	OO
that	OO
are	OO
giving	OO
off	OO
light	,O
you've	OO
got	OO
telescopes	OO
that	OO
are	OO
collecting	OO
that	OO
light	,O
and	OO
you've	OO
got	OO
instruments	OO
that	OO
are	OO
helping	OO
you	OO
understand	OO
what	OO
that	OO
light	OO
is	.O
many	OU
of	OO
you	OO
have	OO
mapped	OO
the	OO
moon	OU
phases	OO
over	OO

with	OO
your	OO
eyes	,O
your	OO
eyes	OO
being	OO
your	OO
more	OO
basic	OO

you've	OO

with	OO
your	OO

your	OO

being	OO
one	OO
of	OO
your	OO

now	,U
if	OO
you	OO

a	OO
buddy	OO
get	OO
together	,O
you	OO
would	OO
spend	OO
over	OO
30	OO
years	,O
you	OO
would	OO
map	OO
1,000	OO

extremely	OO

you	OU
would	OO
move	OO
the	OO

and	OU
that's	OO
what	OO
tycho	OU
brahe	OU
and	OO
his	OO
buddy	,O
or	OO
his	OO
assistant	,O
really	,O
johannes	OU
kepler	OU
did	OO
back	OO
in	OO
the	OO
1600s	.O
and	OU
they	OO
moved	OO
the	OO

out	OO
how	OO

how	OO
they	OO

around	OO
the	OO

but	OU
it	OO
wasn't	OO
until	OO
about	OO
100	OO
years	OO

that	OO
we	OO
realized	OO
it's	OO
a	OO
big	OO
universe	.O
it	OU
seems	OO
like	OO
the	OO

just	OO
infinite	,O
which	OO
it	OO
is	,O
but	OO
the	OO
observable	OO
universe	OO
is	OO
finite	.O
which	OU
means	OO
we	OO
can	OO
win	OO
the	OO
battle	.O
but	OU
if	OO
you're	OO
going	OO
to	OO
map	OO
the	OO

you're	OO
not	OO
going	OO
to	OO
do	OO
it	OO
with	OO
one	OO
or	OO
two	OO
of	OO
your	OO
besties	.O
mapping	OU
the	OO
universe	OO
takes	OO
an	OO

an	OO

this	OO

how	OO

to	OO
truly	OO
advance	OO
the	OO

in	OU
sdss	,U
we	OO
divide	OO
the	OO

three	OO

for	OO
the	OO

one	OO
for	OO
the	OO

my	OU

we're	OO

the	OO

a	OO
surface	.O
these	OU

we	OO

that	OO

the	OO

it	.O
what's	OU

about	OO

that	OO
we	OO

today	.O
there	OU

telescopes	OO
out	OO
there	.O
but	OU
in	OO
sdss	OU
we	OO
use	OO
new	OO

on	OO
these	OO
old	OO

to	OO
make	OO

we	OU
capture	OO

from	OO
all	OO

those	OO

and	OO
that	OO
light	OO

then	OO
focused	OO
at	OO
the	OO

where	OO
our	OO

sit	OO
and	OO
process	OO
that	OO

what's	OU

in	OO

v	OU
is	OO
that	OO
we're	OO
making	OO
the	OO

entirely	OO
robotic	.O
that's	OU
right:	OO
robots	.O
so	OU
i'm	OU
going	OO
to	OO
show	OO
them	OO
to	OO
you	,O
but	OO
they're	OO
fierce	OO
and	OO
terrifying	,O
and	OO
i	OU
want	OO
you	OO
all	OO
to	OO
just	OO
take	OO
a	OO
breath	.O
trigger	OU
warning	.O
and	OU
with	OO
no	OO
apologies	OO
to	OO
all	OO
the	OO
blade	OU

among	OO
you	,O
here	OO
they	OO
are	.O
i	OU
have	OO
1,000	OO

these	,O
500	OO
in	OO
the	OO
focal	OO

of	OO
each	OO

in	OO
each	OO

and	OU
this	OO
is	OO
how	OO
they	OO
move	OO
on	OO
the	OO
sky	.O
so	OU
these	OO
are	OO
our	OO
objects	OO
and	OO
a	OO
star	OO
field	,O
so	OO
you've	OO
got	OO
stars	,O
galaxies	,O
black	OO

and	OU
our	OO
robots	OO
move	OO
to	OO
those	OO

as	OO
we	OO

the	OO

from	OO
those	OO

and	OO
black	OO

and	OO
yes	,O
it	OO
is	OO
weird	OO
to	OO

black	OO

but	OO
we've	OO
already	OO
gone	OO
over	OO
that	OO
black	OO

one	OU
more	OO
thing	.O
stars	OU

all	OO

black	OU

all	OO
the	OO

there	OU

the	OO

one	OO

we	OU

we're	OO

we're	OO

the	OU

these	OO

the	OU

that	OO
we	OO
found	OO

so	OO
far	OO
into	OO
the	OO

five	OO

so	OU

if	OO
you	OO

you	OO

run	OO
an	OO
entire	OO
5k	OO

and	OO
microbes	OO
would	OO
line	OO
your	OO

so	OU
you	OO
may	OO
not	OO
have	OO
ever	OO
thought	OO
about	OO
these	OO
microbes	OO
that	OO
are	OO
deep	OO
inside	OO
earth's	OO

but	OO
you	OO
probably	OO
thought	OO
about	OO
the	OO
microbes	OO
living	OO
in	OO
our	OO
guts	.O
if	OU
you	OO
add	OO
up	OO
the	OO

microbiomes	OO
of	OO
all	OO
the	OO
people	OO
and	OO
all	OO
the	OO
animals	OO
on	OO
the	OO
planet	,O
collectively	,O
this	OO
weighs	OO
about	OO
100,000	OO
tons	.O
this	OU
is	OO
a	OO
huge	OO
biome	OO
that	OO
we	OO
carry	OO
in	OO
our	OO
bellies	OO
every	OO
single	OO
day	.O
we	OU
should	OO
all	OO
be	OO
proud	.O
but	OU
it	OO
pales	OO
in	OO
comparison	OO
to	OO
the	OO
number	OO
of	OO
microbes	OO
that	OO
are	OO
covering	OO
the	OO
entire	OO
surface	OO
of	OO
the	OO
earth	,O
like	OO
in	OO
our	OO
soils	,O
our	OO
rivers	OO
and	OO
our	OO
oceans	.O
collectively	,U
these	OO
weigh	OO
about	OO
two	OO
billion	OO
tons	.O
but	OU
it	OO
turns	OO
out	OO
that	OO
the	OO
majority	OO
of	OO
microbes	OO
on	OO
earth	OO
aren't	OO
even	OO
in	OO
oceans	OO
or	OO
our	OO
guts	OO
or	OO
sewage	OO
treatment	OO
plants	.O
most	OU
of	OO
them	OO
are	OO
actually	OO
inside	OO
the	OO
earth's	OO
crust	.O
so	OU
collectively	,O
these	OO
weigh	OO
40	OO
billion	OO
tons	.O
this	OU
is	OO
one	OO
of	OO
the	OO
biggest	OO
biomes	OO
on	OO
the	OO

and	OO
we	OO
didn't	OO
even	OO
know	OO
it	OO
existed	OO
until	OO
a	OO
few	OO
decades	OO

so	OU
the	OO
possibilities	OO
for	OO
what	OO
life	OO

like	OO
down	OO
there	,O
or	OO
what	OO
it	OO
might	OO
do	OO
for	OO
humans	,O
are	OO
limitless	.O
this	OU
is	OO
a	OO
map	OO
showing	OO
a	OO
red	OO

for	OO
every	OO
place	OO
where	OO
we've	OO
gotten	OO
pretty	OO
good	OO
deep	OO
subsurface	OO
samples	OO
with	OO
modern	OO
microbiological	OO
methods	,O
and	OO
you	OO
may	OO
be	OO
impressed	OO
that	OO
we're	OO
getting	OO
a	OO
pretty	OO
good	OO
global	OO
coverage	,O
but	OO
actually	,O
if	OO
you	OO
remember	OO
that	OO
these	OO
are	OO
the	OO
only	OO
places	OO
that	OO
we	OO
have	OO
samples	OO
from	,O
it	OO
looks	OO
a	OO
little	OO
worse	.O
if	OU
we	OO
were	OO
all	OO
in	OO
an	OO
alien	OO
spaceship	,O
trying	OO
to	OO
reconstruct	OO
a	OO

from	OO
only	OO
these	OO

we'd	OO
never	OO
be	OO

to	OO
do	OO
it	.O
so	OU
people	OO
sometimes	OO
say	OO
to	OO
me	,O
yeah	,U
there's	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
microbes	OO
in	OO
the	OO

but	.O
aren't	OO
they	OO
just	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
dormant	?O
this	OU
is	OO
a	OO
good	OO
point	.O
relative	OU
to	OO
a	OO
ficus	OO
plant	OO
or	OO
the	OO
measles	OO
or	OO
my	OO
kid's	OO
guinea	OO
pigs	,O
these	OO
microbes	OO
probably	OO
aren't	OO
doing	OO
much	OO
of	OO
anything	OO
at	OO
all	.O
we	OU
know	OO
that	OO
they	OO
have	OO
to	OO
be	OO
slow	,O
because	OO
there's	OO
so	OO
many	OO
of	OO
them	.O
if	OU
they	OO
all	OO
started	OO
dividing	OO
at	OO
the	OO
rate	OO
of	OO
e	.U

then	OO
they	OO
would	OO
double	OO
the	OO

of	OO
the	OO
earth	,O

included	,O
over	OO
a	OO
single	OO
night	.O
in	OU
fact	,O
many	OO
of	OO
them	OO
probably	OO
haven't	OO
even	OO
undergone	OO
a	OO

division	OO
since	OO
the	OO
time	OO
of	OO
ancient	OO
egypt	.U
which	OU
is	OO
just	OO
crazy	.O
like	,U
how	OO
do	OO
you	OO
wrap	OO
your	OO
head	OO
around	OO
things	OO
that	OO
are	OO
so	OO
long	OO
lived	?O
but	OU
i	OU
thought	OO
of	OO
an	OO
analogy	OO
that	OO
i	OU
really	OO
love	,O
but	OO
it's	OO
weird	OO
and	OO
it's	OO
complicated	.O
so	OU
i	OU
hope	OO
that	OO
you	OO
can	OO
all	OO
go	OO
there	OO
with	OO
me	.O
alright	,U
let's	OO
try	OO
it	.O
it's	OU
like	OO
trying	OO
to	OO
figure	OO
out	OO
the	OO
life	OO
cycle	OO
of	OO
a	OO
tree	.O
if	OO
you	OO
only	OO
lived	OO
for	OO
a	OO
day	.O
so	OU
like	OO
if	OO
human	OO
life	OO
span	OO
was	OO
only	OO
a	OO
day	,O
and	OO
we	OO
lived	OO
in	OO
winter	,O
then	OO
you	OO
would	OO
go	OO
your	OO
entire	OO
life	OO
without	OO
ever	OO
seeing	OO
a	OO
tree	OO
with	OO
a	OO
leaf	OO
on	OO
it	.O
and	OU
there	OO
would	OO
be	OO
so	OO
many	OO
human	OO
generations	OO
that	OO
would	OO
pass	OO
by	OO
within	OO
a	OO
single	OO
winter	OO
that	OO
you	OO
may	OO
not	OO
even	OO
have	OO
access	OO
to	OO
a	OO
history	OO
book	OO
that	OO
says	OO
anything	OO
other	OO
than	OO
the	OO
fact	OO
that	OO
trees	OO
are	OO
always	OO
lifeless	OO
sticks	OO
that	OO
don't	OO
do	OO
anything	.O
of	OU
course	,O
this	OO
is	OO
ridiculous	.O
we	OU
know	OO
that	OO
trees	OO
are	OO
just	OO
waiting	OO
for	OO
summer	OO
so	OO
they	OO
can	OO
reactivate	.O
but	OU
if	OO
the	OO
human	OO
life	OO
span	OO
were	OO
significantly	OO
shorter	OO
than	OO
that	OO
of	OO
trees	,O
we	OO
might	OO
be	OO
completely	OO
oblivious	OO
to	OO
this	OO
totally	OO
mundane	OO
fact	.O
so	OU
when	OO
we	OO
say	OO
that	OO
these	OO
deep	OO
subsurface	OO
microbes	OO
are	OO
just	OO
dormant	,O
are	OO
we	OO
like	OO
people	OO
who	OO
die	OO
after	OO
a	OO
day	,O
trying	OO
to	OO
figure	OO
out	OO
how	OO
trees	OO
work	?O
what	OU
if	OO
these	OO
deep	OO
subsurface	OO
organisms	OO
are	OO
just	OO
waiting	OO
for	OO
their	OO
version	OO
of	OO
summer	,O
but	OO
our	OO
lives	OO
are	OO
too	OO
short	OO
for	OO
us	OO
to	OO
see	OO
it	?O
if	OU
you	OO
take	OO
e	.U
coli	OO
and	OO
seal	OO
it	OO
up	OO
in	OO
a	OO
test	OO
tube	,O
with	OO
no	OO
food	OO
or	OO
nutrients	,O
and	OO
leave	OO
it	OO
there	OO
for	OO
months	OO
to	OO
years	,O
most	OO
of	OO
the	OO
cells	OO
die	OO
off	,O
of	OO
course	,O
because	OO
they're	OO
starving	.O
but	OU
a	OO
few	OO
of	OO
the	OO
cells	OO
survive	.O
if	OU
you	OO
take	OO
these	OO
old	OO
surviving	OO
cells	OO
and	OO
compete	OO
them	,O
also	OO
under	OO
starvation	OO
conditions	,O
against	OO
a	OO
new	,O
fast	OO
growing	OO
culture	OO
of	OO
e	.U
coli	,O
the	OO
grizzled	OO
old	OO
tough	OO
guys	OO
beat	OO
out	OO
the	OO
squeaky	OO
clean	OO
upstarts	OO
every	OO
single	OO
time	.O
so	OU
this	OO
is	OO
evidence	OO
there's	OO
actually	OO
an	OO
evolutionary	OO
payoff	OO
to	OO
being	OO
extraordinarily	OO
slow	.O
so	OU
it's	OO
possible	OO
that	OO
maybe	OO
we	OO
should	OO
not	OO
equate	OO
being	OO
slow	OO
with	OO
being	OO
unimportant	.O
maybe	OU
these	OO
out	OO
of	OO
sight	,O
out	OO
of	OO
mind	OO
microbes	OO
could	OO
actually	OO
be	OO
helpful	OO
to	OO
humanity	.O
ok	,U
so	OO
as	OO
far	OO
as	OO
we	OO
know	,O
there	OO
are	OO
two	OO
ways	OO
to	OO
do	OO
subsurface	OO
living	.O
the	OU
first	OO
is	OO
to	OO
wait	OO
for	OO
food	OO
to	OO
trickle	OO
down	OO
from	OO
the	OO
surface	OO
world	,O
like	OO
trying	OO
to	OO
eat	OO
the	OO
leftovers	OO
of	OO
a	OO
picnic	OO
that	OO
happened	OO
1,000	OO
years	OO
ago	.O
which	OU
is	OO
a	OO
crazy	OO
way	OO
to	OO
live	,O
but	OO
shockingly	OO
seems	OO
to	OO
work	OO
out	OO
for	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
microbes	OO
in	OO
earth	.O
the	OU
other	OO
possibility	OO
is	OO
for	OO
a	OO
microbe	OO
to	OO
just	OO
say	,O
nah	,U
i	OU
don't	OO
need	OO
the	OO
surface	OO
world	.O
i'm	OU
good	OO
down	OO
here	.O
for	OU
microbes	OO
that	OO
go	OO
this	OO
route	,O
they	OO
have	OO
to	OO
get	OO
everything	OO
that	OO
they	OO
need	OO
in	OO
order	OO
to	OO
survive	OO
from	OO
inside	OO
the	OO
earth	.O
some	OU
things	OO
are	OO
actually	OO
easier	OO
for	OO
them	OO
to	OO
get	.O
they're	OU
more	OO
abundant	OO
inside	OO
the	OO
earth	,O
like	OO
water	OO
or	OO
nutrients	,O
like	OO
nitrogen	OO
and	OO
iron	OO
and	OO
phosphorus	,O
or	OO
places	OO
to	OO
live	.O
these	OU
are	OO
things	OO
that	OO
we	OO
literally	OO
kill	OO
each	OO
other	OO
to	OO
get	OO
ahold	OO
of	OO
up	OO
at	OO
the	OO
surface	OO
world	.O
but	OU
in	OO
the	OO
subsurface	,O
the	OO
problem	OO
is	OO
finding	OO
enough	OO
energy	.O
up	OU
at	OO
the	OO
surface	,O
plants	OO
can	OO
chemically	OO
knit	OO
together	OO
carbon	OO
dioxide	OO
molecules	OO
into	OO
yummy	OO
sugars	OO
as	OO
fast	OO
as	OO
the	OO
sun's	OO
photons	OO
hit	OO
their	OO
leaves	.O
but	OU
in	OO
the	OO
subsurface	,O
of	OO
course	,O
there's	OO
no	OO
sunlight	,O
so	OO
this	OO
ecosystem	OO
has	OO
to	OO
solve	OO
the	OO
problem	OO
of	OO
who	OO
is	OO
going	OO
to	OO
make	OO
the	OO
food	OO
for	OO
everybody	OO
else	.O
the	OU
subsurface	OO
needs	OO
something	OO
that's	OO
like	OO
a	OO
plant	OO
but	OO
it	OO
breathes	OO
rocks	.O
luckily	,U
such	OO
a	OO
thing	OO
exists	,O
and	OO
it's	OO
called	OO
a	OO
chemolithoautotroph	.O
which	OU
is	OO
a	OO
microbe	OO
that	OO
uses	OO
chemicals	OO
—	OO
chemo	,O
from	OO
rocks	OO
—	OO
litho	,O
to	OO
make	OO
food	OO
—	OO
autotroph	.O
and	OU
they	OO
can	OO
do	OO
this	OO
with	OO
a	OO
ton	OO
of	OO
different	OO
elements	.O
they	OU
can	OO
do	OO
this	OO
with	OO
sulphur	,O
iron	,O
manganese	,O
nitrogen	,O
carbon	,O
some	OO
of	OO
them	OO
can	OO
use	OO
pure	OO
electrons	,O
straight	OO
up	.O
like	,U
if	OO
you	OO
cut	OO
the	OO
end	OO
off	OO
of	OO
an	OO
electrical	OO
cord	,O
they	OO
could	OO
breathe	OO
it	OO
like	OO
a	OO
snorkel	.O
these	OU
chemolithoautotrophs	OO
take	OO
the	OO
energy	OO
that	OO
they	OO
get	OO
from	OO
these	OO
processes	OO
and	OO
use	OO
it	OO
to	OO
make	OO
food	,O
like	OO
plants	OO
do	.O
but	OU
we	OO
know	OO
that	OO
plants	OO
do	OO
more	OO
than	OO
just	OO
make	OO
food	.O
they	OU
also	OO
make	OO
a	OO
waste	OO
product	,O
oxygen	,O
which	OO
we	OO
are	OO
100	OO
percent	OO
dependent	OO
upon	.O
but	OU
the	OO
waste	OO
product	OO
that	OO
these	OO
chemolithoautotrophs	OO
make	OO
is	OO
often	OO
in	OO
the	OO
form	OO
of	OO
minerals	,O
like	OO
rust	OO
or	OO
pyrite	,O
like	OO
fool's	OO
gold	,O
or	OO
carminites	,O
like	OO
limestone	.O
so	OU
what	OO
we	OO
have	OO
are	OO
microbes	OO
that	OO
are	OO
really	,O
really	OO
slow	,O
like	OO
rocks	,O
that	OO
get	OO
their	OO
energy	OO
from	OO
rocks	,O
that	OO
make	OO
as	OO
their	OO
waste	OO
product	OO
other	OO
rocks	.O
so	OU
am	OO
i	OU
talking	OO
about	OO
biology	,O
or	OO
am	OO
i	OU
talking	OO
about	OO
geology	?O
this	OU
stuff	OO
really	OO
blurs	OO
the	OO
lines	.O
so	OU
if	OO
i'm	OU
going	OO
to	OO
do	OO
this	OO
thing	,O
and	OO
i'm	OU
going	OO
to	OO
be	OO
a	OO
biologist	OO
who	OO
studies	OO
microbes	OO
that	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
act	OO
like	OO
rocks	,O
then	OO
i	OU
should	OO
probably	OO
start	OO
studying	OO
geology	.O
and	OU
what's	OO
the	OO
coolest	OO
part	OO
of	OO
geology	?O
volcanoes	.U
this	OU
is	OO
looking	OO
inside	OO
the	OO
crater	OO
of	OO
poás	OU
volcano	OU
in	OO
costa	OU
rica	.U
many	OU
volcanoes	OO
on	OO
earth	OO
arise	OO
because	OO
an	OO
oceanic	OO
tectonic	OO
plate	OO
crashes	OO
into	OO
a	OO
continental	OO
plate	.O
as	OU
this	OO
oceanic	OO
plate	OO
subducts	OO
or	OO
gets	OO
moved	OO
underneath	OO
this	OO
continental	OO
plate	,O
things	OO
like	OO
water	OO
and	OO
carbon	OO
dioxide	OO
and	OO
other	OO
materials	OO
get	OO
squeezed	OO
out	OO
of	OO
it	,O
like	OO
ringing	OO
a	OO
wet	OO
washcloth	.O
so	OU
in	OO
this	OO
way	,O
subduction	OO
zones	OO
are	OO
like	OO
portals	OO
into	OO
the	OO
deep	OO
earth	,O
where	OO
materials	OO
are	OO
exchanged	OO
between	OO
the	OO
surface	OO
and	OO
the	OO
subsurface	OO
world	.O
so	OU
i	OU
was	OO
recently	OO
invited	OO
by	OO
some	OO
of	OO
my	OO
colleagues	OO
in	OO
costa	OU
rica	OU
to	OO
come	OO
and	OO
work	OO
with	OO
them	OO
on	OO
some	OO
of	OO
the	OO
volcanoes	.O
and	OU
of	OO
course	OO
i	OU
said	OO
yes	,O
because	,O
i	OU
mean	,O
costa	OU
rica	OU
is	OO
beautiful	,O
but	OO
also	OO
because	OO
it	OO
sits	OO
on	OO
top	OO
of	OO
one	OO
of	OO
these	OO
subduction	OO
zones	.O
we	OU
wanted	OO
to	OO
ask	OO
the	OO
very	OO
specific	OO
question:	OO
why	OU
is	OO
it	OO
that	OO
the	OO
carbon	OO
dioxide	OO
that	OO
comes	OO
out	OO
of	OO
this	OO
deeply	OO
buried	OO
oceanic	OO
tectonic	OO
plate	OO
is	OO
only	OO
coming	OO
out	OO
of	OO
the	OO
volcanoes	?O
why	OU
don't	OO
we	OO
see	OO
it	OO
distributed	OO
throughout	OO
the	OO
entire	OO
subduction	OO
zone	?O
do	OU
the	OO
microbes	OO
have	OO
something	OO
to	OO
do	OO
with	OO
that	?O
so	OU
this	OO
is	OO
a	OO
picture	OO
of	OO
me	OO
inside	OO
poás	OU
volcano	,U
along	OO
with	OO
my	OO
colleague	OO
donato	OU
giovannelli	.U
that	OU
lake	OO
that	OO
we're	OO
standing	OO
next	OO
to	OO
is	OO
made	OO
of	OO
pure	OO
battery	OO
acid	.O
i	OU
know	OO
this	OO
because	OO
we	OO
were	OO
measuring	OO
the	OO
ph	OO
when	OO
this	OO
picture	OO
was	OO
taken	.O
and	OU
at	OO
some	OO
point	OO
while	OO
we	OO
were	OO
working	OO
inside	OO
the	OO
crater	,O
i	OU
turned	OO
to	OO
my	OO
costa	OU
rican	OU
colleague	OO
carlos	OU
ramírez	OU
and	OO
i	OU
said	,O
alright	,U
if	OO
this	OO
thing	OO
starts	OO
erupting	OO
right	OO
now	,O
what's	OO
our	OO
exit	OO
strategy	?O
and	OU
he	OO
said	,O
oh	,U
yeah	,O
great	OO
question	,O
it's	OO
totally	OO
easy	.O
just	OU
turn	OO
around	OO
and	OO
enjoy	OO
the	OO
view	.O
because	OU
it	OO
will	OO
be	OO
your	OO
last	.O
and	OU
it	OO
may	OO
sound	OO
like	OO
he	OO
was	OO
being	OO
overly	OO
dramatic	,O
but	OO
54	OO
days	OO
after	OO
i	OU
was	OO
standing	OO
next	OO
to	OO
that	OO
lake	,O
this	OO
happened	.O
audience:	OU
oh	.U
freaking	OU
terrifying	,O
right	?O
this	OU
was	OO
the	OO
biggest	OO
eruption	OO
this	OO
volcano	OO
had	OO
had	OO
in	OO
60	OO
some	OO
odd	OO
years	,O
and	OO
not	OO
long	OO
after	OO
this	OO
video	OO
ends	,O
the	OO
camera	OO
that	OO
was	OO
taking	OO
the	OO
video	OO
is	OO
obliterated	OO
and	OO
the	OO
entire	OO
lake	OO
that	OO
we	OO
had	OO
been	OO
sampling	OO
vaporizes	OO
completely	.O
but	OU
i	OU
also	OO
want	OO
to	OO
be	OO
clear	OO
that	OO
we	OO
were	OO
pretty	OO
sure	OO
this	OO
was	OO
not	OO
going	OO
to	OO
happen	OO
on	OO
the	OO
day	OO
that	OO
we	OO
were	OO
actually	OO
in	OO
the	OO
volcano	,O
because	OO
costa	OU
rica	OU
monitors	OO
its	OO
volcanoes	OO
very	OO
carefully	OO
through	OO
the	OO
ovsicori	OU
institute	,U
and	OO
we	OO
had	OO
scientists	OO
from	OO
that	OO
institute	OO
with	OO
us	OO
on	OO
that	OO
day	.O
but	OU
the	OO
fact	OO
that	OO
it	OO
erupted	OO
illustrates	OO
perfectly	OO
that	OO
if	OO
you	OO
want	OO
to	OO
look	OO
for	OO
where	OO
carbon	OO
dioxide	OO
gas	OO
is	OO
coming	OO
out	OO
of	OO
this	OO
oceanic	OO
plate	,O
then	OO
you	OO
should	OO
look	OO
no	OO
further	OO
than	OO
the	OO
volcanoes	OO
themselves	.O
but	OU
if	OO
you	OO
go	OO
to	OO
costa	OU
rica	,U
you	OO
may	OO
notice	OO
that	OO
in	OO
addition	OO
to	OO
these	OO
volcanoes	OO
there	OO
are	OO
tons	OO
of	OO
cozy	OO
little	OO
hot	OO
springs	OO
all	OO
over	OO
the	OO
place	.O
some	OU
of	OO
the	OO
water	OO
in	OO
these	OO
hot	OO
springs	OO
is	OO
actually	OO
bubbling	OO
up	OO
from	OO
this	OO
deeply	OO
buried	OO
oceanic	OO
plate	.O
and	OU
our	OO
hypothesis	OO
was	OO
that	OO
there	OO
should	OO
be	OO
carbon	OO
dioxide	OO
bubbling	OO
up	OO
with	OO
it	,O
but	OO
something	OO
deep	OO
underground	OO
was	OO
filtering	OO
it	OO
out	.O
so	OU
we	OO
spent	OO
two	OO
weeks	OO
driving	OO
all	OO
around	OO
costa	OU
rica	,U
sampling	OO
every	OO
hot	OO
spring	OO
we	OO
could	OO
find	OO
—	OO
it	OO
was	OO
awful	,O
let	OO
me	OO
tell	OO
you	.O
and	OU
then	OO
we	OO
spent	OO
the	OO
next	OO
two	OO
years	OO
measuring	OO
and	OO
analyzing	OO
data	.O
and	OU
if	OO
you're	OO
not	OO
a	OO
scientist	,O
i'll	OU
just	OO
let	OO
you	OO
know	OO
that	OO
the	OO
big	OO
discoveries	OO
don't	OO
really	OO
happen	OO
when	OO
you're	OO
at	OO
a	OO
beautiful	OO
hot	OO
spring	OO
or	OO
on	OO
a	OO
public	OO
stage;	OO
they	OO
happen	OO
when	OO
you're	OO
hunched	OO
over	OO
a	OO
messy	OO
computer	OO
or	OO
you're	OO
troubleshooting	OO
a	OO
difficult	OO
instrument	,O
or	OO
you're	OO
skyping	OU
your	OO
colleagues	OO
because	OO
you	OO
are	OO
completely	OO
confused	OO
about	OO
your	OO
data	.O
scientific	OU
discoveries	,O
kind	OO
of	OO
like	OO
deep	OO
subsurface	OO
microbes	,O
can	OO
be	OO
very	,O
very	OO
slow	.O
but	OU
in	OO
our	OO
case	,O
this	OO
really	OO
paid	OO
off	OO
this	OO
one	OO
time	.O
we	OU
discovered	OO
that	OO
literally	OO
tons	OO
of	OO
carbon	OO
dioxide	OO
were	OO
coming	OO
out	OO
of	OO
this	OO
deeply	OO
buried	OO
oceanic	OO
plate	.O
and	OU
the	OO
thing	OO
that	OO
was	OO
keeping	OO
them	OO
underground	OO
and	OO
keeping	OO
it	OO
from	OO

all	OO
the	OO

of	OO

were	OO
chemolithoautotrophs	.O
these	OU
microbes	OO
and	OO
the	OO
chemical	OO
processes	OO
that	OO
were	OO
happening	OO
around	OO
them	OO
were	OO
converting	OO
this	OO
carbon	OO

into	OO
carbonate	OO
mineral	OO
and	OO
locking	OO
it	OO
up	OO
underground	.O
which	OU
makes	OO
you	OO
wonder:	OO
if	OU
these	OO

processes	OO
are	OO
so	OO
good	OO
at	OO
sucking	OO
up	OO
all	OO
the	OO
carbon	OO

coming	OO
from	OO
below	OO
them	,O
could	OO
they	OO
also	OO
help	OO
us	OO
with	OO
a	OO
little	OO
carbon	OO
problem	OO
we've	OO
got	OO
going	OO
on	OO
up	OO
at	OO
the	OO
surface	?O
humans	OU
are	OO
releasing	OO
enough	OO
carbon	OO

into	OO
our	OO
atmosphere	OO
that	OO
we	OO
are	OO
decreasing	OO
the	OO
ability	OO
of	OO
our	OO

to	OO
support	OO
life	OO
as	OO
we	OO
know	OO
it	.O
and	OU
scientists	OO

are	OO
working	OO
on	OO
methods	OO
to	OO
pull	OO
carbon	OO

out	OO
of	OO
these	OO
point	OO
sources	,O
so	OO
that	OO
they're	OO
not	OO
released	OO
into	OO
the	OO

and	OU
they	OO
need	OO
to	OO
put	OO
it	OO
somewhere	.O
so	OU
for	OO
this	OO
reason	,O
we	OO
need	OO
to	OO

places	OO
where	OO
this	OO
carbon	OO

be	OO
stored	,O

in	OO

to	OO

what's	OO

to	OO
happen	OO
to	OO
it	OO
when	OO
it	OO
goes	OO
there	.O
will	OU
these	OO
deep	OO

microbes	OO
be	OO
a	OO
problem	OO
because	OO
they're	OO
too	OO
slow	OO
to	OO

anything	OO
down	OO
there	?O
or	OU
will	OO
they	OO
be	OO

because	OO
they'll	OO

if	OU

just	OO
from	OO

that	OO

where	OO

here’s	OU
where	OO

this	OU
is	OO
called	OO
“treatment	OO

on	OU
a	OO
global	OO
scale	,O
this	OO
has	OO
the	OO
potential	OO
to	OO
end	OO
the	OO
hiv	OU
epidemic	.O
it’s	OU
based	OO
on	OO
the	OO
idea	OO
that	OO
someone	OO

can	OO
lower	OO
the	OO

level	OO
in	OO
their	OO

until	OO
it	OO

that	OU

the	OO

gone;	OO
it	OO
could	OO
still	OO
be	OO
lurking	OO
within	OO

when	OO

that's	OO

what	OO
i	OU

you're	OO

to	OO
strip	OO
everything	OO
away	OO
and	OO
focus	OO
on	OO
the	OO

between	OO

whereas	OO

focus	OO
on	OO

the	OO

—	OO
the	OO

the	OO

the	OO

the	OO

so	OU
i	OU
began	OO
to	OO

how	OO
we	OO

on	OO
making	OO

by	OO

not	OO
obsessing	OO
with	OO
the	OO

and	OU
i	OU
set	OO
out	OO
and	OO
interviewed	OO
dozens	OO
of	OO
brave	OO

—	OO
an	OO

a	OO

a	OO
rabbi	,O
a	OO

counselor—	OO
to	OO
better	OO
understand	OO
what	OO
creates	OO
meaningful	OO
and	OO
even	OO
transformative	OO
gatherings	.O
and	OU
i	OU
want	OO
to	OO
share	OO
with	OO
you	OO
some	OO
of	OO
what	OO
i	OU
learned	OO
today	OO
about	OO
the	OO
new	OO
rules	OO
of	OO
gathering	.O
so	OU
when	OO
most	OO
people	OO
plan	OO
a	OO
gathering	,O
they	OO
start	OO
with	OO
an	OO
off	OO
the	OO
rack	OO
format	.O
birthday	OU
party	?O
cake	OU
and	OO
candles	.O
board	OU
meeting	?O
one	OU
brown	OO
table	,O
12	OO
white	OO
men	.O
assuming	OU
the	OO
purpose	OO
is	OO
obvious	,O
we	OO
skip	OO
too	OO
quickly	OO
to	OO
form	.O
this	OU
not	OO
only	OO
leads	OO
to	OO
dull	OO
and	OO
repetitive	OO
gatherings	,O
it	OO
misses	OO
a	OO
deeper	OO
opportunity	OO
to	OO
actually	OO
address	OO
our	OO
needs	.O
the	OU
first	OO
step	OO
of	OO
creating	OO
more	OO
meaningful	OO
everyday	OO
gatherings	OO
is	OO
to	OO
embrace	OO
a	OO
specific	OO
disputable	OO
purpose	.O
an	OU
expectant	OO
mother	OO
i	OU
know	OO
was	OO
dreading	OO
her	OO
baby	OO
shower	.O
the	OU
idea	OO
of	OO
pin	OO
the	OO
diaper	OO
on	OO
the	OO
baby	OO
games	OO
and	OO
opening	OO
gifts	OO
felt	OO
odd	OO
and	OO
irrelevant	.O
so	OU
she	OO
paused	OO
to	OO
ask:	OO
what	OU
is	OO
the	OO
purpose	OO
of	OO
a	OO
baby	OO
shower	?O
what	OU
is	OO
my	OO
need	OO
at	OO
this	OO
moment	?O
and	OU
she	OO
realized	OO
it	OO
was	OO
to	OO
address	OO
her	OO
fears	OO
of	OO
her	OO
and	OO
her	OO
husband's	OO
—	OO
remember	OO
that	OO
guy	?O
—	OO
transition	OO
to	OO
parenthood	.O
and	OU
so	OO
she	OO
asked	OO
two	OO
friends	OO
to	OO
invent	OO
a	OO
gathering	OO
based	OO
on	OO
that	.O
and	OU
so	OO
on	OO
a	OO
sunny	OO
afternoon	,O
six	OO
women	OO
gathered	.O
and	OU
first	,O
to	OO
address	OO
her	OO
fear	OO
of	OO
labor	OO
—	OO
she	OO
was	OO
terrified	OO
—	OO
they	OO
told	OO
her	OO
stories	OO
from	OO
her	OO
life	OO
to	OO
remind	OO
her	OO
of	OO
the	OO
characteristics	OO
she	OO
already	OO
carries	OO
—	OO
bravery	,O
wonder	,O
faith	,O
surrender	OO
—	OO
that	OO
they	OO
believed	OO
would	OO
carry	OO
her	OO
and	OO
help	OO
her	OO
in	OO

just	OO
as	OO
your	OO

to	OO

the	OU
next	OO
step	OO
of	OO
creating	OO
more	OO
meaningful	OO
everyday	OO

is	OO
to	OO
cause	OO
good	OO
controversy	.O
you	OU
may	OO
have	OO
learned	,O
as	OO
i	OU
did	,O
never	OO
to	OO
talk	OO
about	OO
sex	,O
politics	OO
or	OO
religion	OO
at	OO
the	OO
dinner	OO
table	.O
it's	OU
a	OO
good	OO
rule	OO
in	OO
that	OO
it	OO
preserves	OO
harmony	,O
or	OO
that's	OO
its	OO
intention	.O
but	OU
it	OO
strips	OO
away	OO
a	OO
core	OO
ingredient	OO
of	OO
meaning	,O
which	OO
is	OO
heat	,O
burning	OO
relevance	.O
the	OU
best	OO
gatherings	OO
learn	OO
to	OO
cultivate	OO
good	OO
controversy	OO
by	OO
creating	OO
the	OO
conditions	OO
for	OO
it	,O
because	OO
human	OO
connection	OO
is	OO
as	OO
threatened	OO
by	OO
unhealthy	OO
peace	OO
as	OO
by	OO
unhealthy	OO
conflict	.O
i	OU
was	OO
once	OO
working	OO
with	OO
an	OO
architecture	OO
firm	,O
and	OO
they	OO
were	OO
at	OO
a	OO
crossroads	.O
they	OU
had	OO
to	OO
figure	OO
out	OO
whether	OO
they	OO
wanted	OO
to	OO
continue	OO
to	OO
be	OO
an	OO
architecture	OO
firm	OO
and	OO
focus	OO
on	OO
the	OO
construction	OO
of	OO
buildings	OO
or	OO
pivot	OO
and	OO
become	OO
the	OO
hot	OO
new	OO
thing	,O
a	OO
design	OO
firm	,O
focusing	OO
on	OO
beyond	OO
the	OO
construction	OO
of	OO
spaces	.O
and	OU
there	OO
was	OO
real	OO
disagreement	OO
in	OO
the	OO
room	,O
but	OO
you	OO
wouldn't	OO
know	,O
because	OO
no	OO
one	OO
was	OO
actually	OO
speaking	OO
up	OO
publicly	.O
and	OU
so	OO
we	OO
hosted	OO
good	OO
controversy	.O
after	OU
a	OO
lunch	OO
break	,O
all	OO
the	OO
architects	OO
came	OO
back	,O
and	OO
we	OO
hosted	OO
a	OO
cage	OO
match	.O
they	OU
walked	OO
in	,O
we	OO
took	OO
one	OO
architect	,O
put	OO
him	OO
in	OO
one	OO
corner	OO
to	OO
represent	OO
architecture	,O
the	OO
other	OO
one	OO
to	OO
represent	OO
design	.O
we	OU
threw	OO
white	OO
towels	OO
around	OO
their	OO
necks	,O
stolen	OO
from	OO
the	OO
bathroom	OO
—	OO
sorry	OO
—	OO
played	OO
rocky	OU
music	OO
on	OO
an	OO
ipad	,O
got	OO
each	OO
a	OO
don	OU
king	OU
like	OO
manager	OO
to	OO
rev	OO
them	OO
up	OO
and	OO
prepare	OO
them	OO
with	OO
counterarguments	,O
and	OO
then	OO
basically	OO
made	OO
them	OO
each	OO
argue	OO
the	OO
best	OO
possible	OO
argument	OO
of	OO
each	OO
future	OO
vision	.O
the	OU
norm	OO
of	OO
politeness	OO
was	OO
blocking	OO
their	OO
progress	.O
and	OU
we	OO
then	OO
had	OO
everybody	OO
else	OO
physically	OO
choose	OO
a	OO
side	OO
in	OO
front	OO
of	OO
their	OO
colleagues	.O
and	OU
because	OO
they	OO
were	OO
able	OO
to	OO
actually	OO
show	OO
where	OO
they	OO
stood	,O
they	OO
broke	OO
an	OO
impasse	.O
architecture	OU
won	.O
so	OU
that's	OO
work	.O
what	OU
about	OO
a	OO
hypothetical	OO
tense	OO
thanksgiving	OU
dinner	?O
anyone	?U
so	OU
first	,O
ask	OO
the	OO
purpose	.O
what	OU
does	OO
this	OO
family	OO
need	OO
this	OO
year	?O
if	OU
cultivating	OO
good	OO
heat	OO
is	OO
part	OO
of	OO
it	,O
then	OO
try	OO
for	OO
a	OO
night	OO
banning	OO
opinions	OO
and	OO
asking	OO
for	OO
stories	OO
instead	.O
choose	OU
a	OO
theme	OO
related	OO
to	OO
the	OO
underlying	OO
conflict	.O
but	OU
instead	OO
of	OO
opinions	,O
ask	OO
everybody	OO
to	OO
share	OO
a	OO
story	OO
from	OO
their	OO
life	OO
and	OO
experience	OO
that	OO
nobody	OO
around	OO
the	OO
table	OO
has	OO
ever	OO
heard	,O
to	OO
difference	OO
or	OO
to	OO
belonging	OO
or	OO
to	OO
a	OO
time	OO
i	OU
changed	OO
my	OO
mind	,O
giving	OO
people	OO
a	OO
way	OO
in	OO
to	OO
each	OO
other	OO
without	OO
burning	OO
the	OO
house	OO
down	.O
and	OU
finally	,O
to	OO
create	OO
more	OO
meaningful	OO
everyday	OO
gatherings	,O
create	OO
a	OO
temporary	OO
alternative	OO
world	OO
through	OO
the	OO
use	OO
of	OO
pop	OO
up	OO
rules	.O
a	OU
few	OO
years	OO
ago	,O
i	OU
started	OO
noticing	OO
invitations	OO
coming	OO
with	OO
a	OO
set	OO
of	OO
rules	.O
kind	OU
of	OO
boring	OO
or	OO
controlling	,O
right	?O
wrong	.U
in	OU
this	OO
multicultural	,O
intersectional	OO
society	,O
where	OO
more	OO
of	OO
us	OO
are	OO
gathered	OO
and	OO
raised	OO
by	OO
people	OO
and	OO
with	OO
etiquette	OO
unlike	OO
our	OO
own	,O
where	OO
we	OO
don't	OO
share	OO
the	OO
etiquette	,O
unspoken	OO
norms	OO
are	OO
trouble	,O
whereas	OO
pop	OO
up	OO
rules	OO
allow	OO
us	OO
to	OO
connect	OO
meaningfully	.O
they're	OU
one	OO
time	OO
only	OO
constitutions	OO
for	OO
a	OO
specific	OO
purpose	.O
so	OU
a	OO
team	OO
dinner	,O
where	OO
different	OO
generations	OO
are	OO
gathering	OO
and	OO
don't	OO
share	OO
the	OO
same	OO
assumptions	OO
of	OO
phone	OO
etiquette:	OO
whoever	OO
looks	OO
at	OO
their	OO
phone	OO
first	OO
foots	OO
the	OO
bill	.O
try	OU
it	.O
for	OU
an	OO
entrepreneurial	OO
advice	OO
circle	OO
of	OO
just	OO
strangers	,O
where	OO
the	OO
hosts	OO
don't	OO
want	OO
everybody	OO
to	OO
just	OO
listen	OO
to	OO
the	OO
one	OO
venture	OO
capitalist	OO
in	OO
the	OO
room	OO
—	OO
knowing	OO
laugh	OO
—	OO
you	OO
can't	OO
reveal	OO
what	OO
you	OO
do	OO
for	OO
a	OO
living	.O
for	OU
a	OO
mom's	OO
dinner	,O
where	OO
you	OO
want	OO
to	OO
upend	OO
the	OO
norms	OO
of	OO
what	OO
women	OO
who	OO
also	OO
happen	OO
to	OO
be	OO
mothers	OO
talk	OO
about	OO
when	OO
they	OO
gather	,O
if	OO
you	OO
talk	OO
about	OO
your	OO
kids	,O
you	OO
have	OO
to	OO
take	OO
a	OO
shot	.O
that's	OU
a	OO
real	OO
dinner	.O
rules	OU
are	OO
powerful	,O
because	OO
they	OO
allow	OO
us	OO
to	OO
temporarily	OO
change	OO
and	OO
harmonize	OO
our	OO
behavior	.O
and	OU
in	OO
diverse	OO
societies	,O
pop	OO
up	OO
rules	OO
carry	OO
special	OO
force	.O
they	OU
allow	OO
us	OO
to	OO
gather	OO
across	OO
difference	,O
to	OO
connect	,O
to	OO
make	OO
meaning	OO
together	OO
without	OO
having	OO
to	OO
be	OO
the	OO
same	.O
when	OU
i	OU
was	OO
a	OO
child	,O
i	OU
navigated	OO
my	OO
two	OO
worlds	OO
by	OO
becoming	OO
a	OO
chameleon	.O
if	OU
somebody	OO
sneezed	OO
in	OO
my	OO
mother's	OO
home	,O
i	OU
would	OO
say	,O
bless	OU
you	,O
in	OO
my	OO
father's	,O
god	OU
bless	OO
you	.O
to	OU
protect	OO
myself	,O
i	OU
hid	,O
as	OO
so	OO
many	OO
of	OO
us	OO
do	.O
and	OU
it	OO
wasn't	OO
until	OO
i	OU
grew	OO
up	OO
and	OO
through	OO
conflict	OO
work	OO
that	OO
i	OU
began	OO
to	OO
stop	OO
hiding	.O
and	OU
i	OU
realized	OO
that	OO
gatherings	OO
for	OO
me	,O
at	OO
their	OO
best	,O
allow	OO
us	OO
to	OO
be	OO
among	OO
others	,O
to	OO
be	OO
seen	OO
for	OO
who	OO
we	OO
are	,O
and	OO
to	OO
see	.O
the	OU
way	OO
we	OO
gather	OO
matters	OO
because	OO
how	OO
we	OO
gather	OO
is	OO
how	OO
we	OO
live	.O
thank	OU
you	.O
malaria	OU
is	OO
still	OO
one	OO
of	OO
the	OO
biggest	OO
killers	OO
on	OO
the	OO
planet	.O
despite	OU
us	OO
making	OO
significant	OO
progress	OO
in	OO
the	OO
last	OO
20	OO
years	,O
half	OO
the	OO
world's	OO
population	OO
is	OO
still	OO
at	OO
risk	OO
from	OO
this	OO
disease	.O
in	OU
fact	,O
every	OO
two	OO
minutes	OO
a	OO
child	OO
dies	OO
from	OO
malaria	.U
our	OU
progress	OO
has	OO
undoubtedly	OO
stalled	.O
now	,U
we	OO
face	OO
many	OO
challenges	OO
when	OO
it	OO
comes	OO
to	OO
tackling	OO
malaria	.U
but	OU
one	OO
of	OO
the	OO
problems	OO
that	OO
we	OO
have	OO
is	OO
actually	OO
finding	OO
people	OO
who	OO
are	OO
infected	OO
with	OO
malaria	OU
in	OO
the	OO
first	OO
place	.O
so	OU
for	OO
example	,O
if	OO
people	OO
have	OO
some	OO
level	OO
of	OO
immunity	OO
to	OO
the	OO
disease	,O
then	OO
they	OO
can	OO
develop	OO
an	OO
infection	OO
and	OO
become	OO
infectious	OO
and	OO
still	OO
pass	OO
it	OO
on	,O
but	OO
not	OO
actually	OO
develop	OO
any	OO
symptoms	,O
and	OO
that	OO
can	OO
be	OO
a	OO
big	OO
problem	OO
because	OO
how	OO
do	OO
you	OO
find	OO
those	OO
people	OO
it's	OO
like	OO
looking	OO
for	OO
a	OO
needle	OO
in	OO
a	OO
haystack	.O
now	,U
scientists	OO
have	OO
been	OO
trying	OO
to	OO
solve	OO
this	OO
problem	OO
for	OO
some	OO
years	,O
but	OO
what	OO
i	OU
want	OO
to	OO
talk	OO
to	OO
you	OO
about	OO
today	OO
is	OO
that	OO
the	OO
solution	OO
to	OO
this	OO
problem	OO
may	OO
have	OO
been	OO
right	OO
under	OO
our	OO
noses	OO
this	OO
whole	OO
time	.O
that	OU
was	OO
a	OO
bit	OO
of	OO
a	OO
heavy	OO
start	OO
with	OO
lots	OO
of	OO
really	OO
important	OO
and	OO
serious	OO
statistics	.O
so	OU
i	OU
want	OO
us	OO
all	OO
to	OO
just	OO
relax	OO
a	OO
little	OO
bit	OO
now	,O
help	OO
me	OO
to	OO
relax	OO
a	OO
little	OO
bit	OO
as	OO
well	.O
so	OU
why	OO
don't	OO
we	OO
all	OO
take	OO
a	OO
nice	OO
deep	OO
breath	OO
in	.O
wow	.U
and	OU
sigh	.O
okay	,U
i'm	OU
going	OO
to	OO
get	OO
blown	OO
away	OO
there	.O
okay	,U
now	OO
i	OU
want	OO
you	OO
to	OO
do	OO
it	OO
again	,O
but	OO
this	OO
time	OO
i	OU
want	OO
you	OO
to	OO
do	OO
it	OO
just	OO
through	OO
your	OO
nose	,O
and	OO
i	OU
want	OO
you	OO
to	OO
really	OO
sense	OO
the	OO
environment	OO
around	OO
you	.O
and	OU
in	OO
fact	,O
i	OU
want	OO
you	OO
to	OO
really	OO
smell	OO
the	OO
person	OO
who's	OO
sitting	OO
next	OO
to	OO
you	,O
even	OO
if	OO
you	OO
don't	OO
know	OO
them	.O
i	OU
don't	OO
care	.O
lean	OU
in	.O
get	OU
your	OO
nose	OO
right	OO
into	OO
their	OO
armpit	.O
stop	OU
being	OO
so	OO
british	OU
about	OO
it	.O
get	OU
your	OO
nose	OO
into	OO
the	OO
armpit	,O
have	OO
a	OO
good	OO
old	OO
sniff	.O
see	OU
what	OO
you	OO
can	OO
smell	.O
now	,U
each	OO
and	OO
everyone	OO
of	OO
us	OO
would	OO
have	OO
had	OO
a	OO
very	OO
different	OO
sensory	OO
experience	OO
there	.O
some	OU
of	OO
us	OO
will	OO
have	OO
smelt	OO
something	OO
rather	OO
pleasant	,O
perhaps	OO
somebody's	OO
perfume	.O
but	OU
some	OO
of	OO
us	OO
might've	OO
smelt	OO
something	OO
a	OO
little	OO
bit	OO
less	OO
pleasant	,O
perhaps	OO
perhaps	OO
somebody's	OO
bad	OO
breath	OO
or	OO
body	OO
odour	.O
maybe	OU
you	OO
even	OO
smelled	OO
your	OO
own	OO
body	OO
odour	.O
but	OU
there's	OO
probably	OO
a	OO
good	OO
reason	OO
that	OO
some	OO
of	OO
us	OO
don't	OO
like	OO
certain	OO
body	OO
smells	.O
throughout	OU
history	,O
there	OO
had	OO
been	OO
many	OO
examples	OO
of	OO
diseases	OO
being	OO
associated	OO
with	OO
a	OO
smell	.O
so	OU
for	OO
example	,O
typhoid	OO
apparently	OO
smells	OO
like	OO
baked	OO
brown	OO
bread	.O
well	,U
that's	OO
quite	OO
a	OO
nice	OO
smell	,O
isn't	OO
it	?O
but	OU
it	OO
starts	OO
to	OO
get	OO
a	OO
little	OO
bit	OO
worse	.O
tb	OU
smells	OO
like	OO
stale	OO
beer	,O
and	OO
yellow	OO
fever	OO
smells	OO
like	OO
the	OO
inside	OO
of	OO
a	OO
butcher	OO
shop	,O
like	OO
raw	OO
meat	.O
and	OU
in	OO
fact	,O
when	OO
you	OO
look	OO
at	OO
the	OO
sort	OO
of	OO
words	OO
used	OO
to	OO
describe	OO
diseases	,O
you	OO
tend	OO
to	OO
find	OO
these	OO
words:	OO
rotting	,O
foul	,O
putrid	OO
or	OO
pungent	.O
so	OU
it's	OO
no	OO
surprise	OO
then	,O
that	OO
smell	OO
and	OO
body	OO
odour	OO
gets	OO
a	OO
bit	OO
of	OO
a	OO
bad	OO
reputation	.O
if	OU
i	OU
was	OO
to	OO
say	OO
to	OO
you:	OO
'you	OO
smell'	,O
you're	OO
going	OO
to	OO
take	OO
that	OO
not	OO
exactly	OO
as	OO
a	OO
compliment	,O
are	OO
you	?O
but	OU
you	OO
do	OO
smell	,O
you've	OO
just	OO
found	OO
that	OO
out	,O
you	OO
do	OO
smell	.O
it's	OU
a	OO
scientific	OO
fact	.O
i'd	OU
quite	OO
like	OO
to	OO
turn	OO
that	OO
on	OO
its	OO
head	.O
what	OU
if	OO
we	OO
could	OO
actually	OO
think	OO
about	OO
smell	OO
in	OO
a	OO
positive	OO
way	?O
what	OU
if	OO
we	OO
could	OO
put	OO
it	OO
to	OO
good	OO
use	?O
what	OU
if	OO
we	OO
could	OO
detect	OO
the	OO
chemicals	OO
that	OO
are	OO
given	OO
off	OO
by	OO
our	OO
bodies	OO
when	OO
we're	OO
ill	OO
and	OO
use	OO
that	OO
to	OO
diagnose	OO
people	?O
now	,U
we'd	OO
need	OO
to	OO
develop	OO
good	OO
sensors	OO
that	OO
would	OO
allow	OO
us	OO
to	OO
do	OO
this	.O
but	OU
it	OO
turns	OO
out	OO
that	OO
the	OO
world's	OO
best	OO
sensors	OO
actually	OO
already	OO
exist	.O
and	OU
they're	OO
called	OO
'animals'	.O
now	,U
animals	OO
are	OO
built	OO
to	OO
smell	.O
they	OU
live	OO
their	OO
everyday	OO
lives	OO
according	OO
to	OO
their	OO
nose	.O
they	OU

the	OO

which	OO

really	OO
important	OO
information	OO
about	OO
how	OO
to	OO

alive	,O
essentially	.O
just	OU

smells	OO
from	OO
everywhere	.O
we've	OU
just	OO
found	OO
out	OO
that	OO
we're	OO
really	OO
smelly	OO
beasts	.O
each	OU
one	OO
of	OO
us	OO
is	OO
producing	OO
500	OO
600	OO
different	OO
volatile	OO
chemicals	.O
it's	OU
not	OO
just	OO
one	OO
chemical	OO
like	OO
bo	,U
lots	OO
and	OO
lots	OO
of	OO
chemicals	.O
but	OU
it's	OO
not	OO
just	OO
you	,O
it's	OO
these	OO
seats	OO
you're	OO
sitting	OO
on	,O
the	OO
carpet	,O
the	OO
glue	OO
that	OO
holds	OO
the	OO
carpet	OO
to	OO
the	OO
floor	,O
the	OO
paint	OO
on	OO
the	OO
walls	,O
the	OO
trees	OO
outside	,O
everything	OO
around	OO
you	OO
is	OO
producing	OO
an	OO
odour	,O
and	OO
it's	OO
a	OO
really	OO
complex	OO
world	OO
that	OO
the	OO
mosquito	OO
has	OO
to	OO
fly	OO
through	,O
and	OO
it	OO
has	OO
to	OO
find	OO
you	OO
within	OO
that	OO
really	OO
complex	OO
world	.O
and	OU
each	OO
and	OO
every	OO
one	OO
of	OO
you	OO
will	OO
know	OO
c'mon	,U
hands	OO
up	,O
who	OO
always	OO
get	OO
bitten	OO
by	OO
mosquitoes	?O
and	OU
hands	OO
up	,O
who	OO
never	OO
get	OO
bitten	?O
there's	OU
always	OO
one	OO
or	OO
two	OO
really	OO
annoying	OO
people	OO
that	OO
never	OO
get	OO
bitten	.O
but	OU
the	OO
mosquito	OO
has	OO
a	OO
really	OO
hard	OO
job	OO
to	OO
find	OO
you	,O
and	OO
that's	OO
all	OO
to	OO
do	OO
with	OO
the	OO
way	OO
you	OO
smell	.O
people	OU
who	OO
don't	OO
attract	OO
mosquitoes	OO
smell	OO
repellent	,O
and	OO
what	OO
we	OO
know	OO
is	OO
i	OU
should	OO
clarify:	OO
repellent	OO
to	OO
mosquitoes	,O
not	OO
to	OO
people	.O
and	OU
what	OO
we	OO
know	OO
now	OO
is	OO
that	OO
is	OO
actually	OO
controlled	OO
by	OO
our	OO
genes	.O
but	OU
mosquitoes	OO
are	OO
able	OO
to	OO
do	OO
that	OO
because	OO
they	OO
have	OO
a	OO
highly	OO
sophisticated	OO
sense	OO
of	OO
smell	,O
and	OO
they're	OO
able	OO
to	OO
see	OO
through	OO
all	OO
this	OO
sort	OO
of	OO
odour	OO
sludge	OO
to	OO
find	OO
you	,O
that	OO
individual	,O
and	OO
bite	OO
you	OO
as	OO
a	OO
blood	OO
meal	.O
but	OU
what	OO
would	OO
happen	OO
if	OO
one	OO
of	OO
you	OO
was	OO
infected	OO
with	OO
malaria	?O
well	,U
let's	OO
just	OO
have	OO
a	OO
quick	OO
look	OO
at	OO
the	OO
malaria	OO
life	OO
cycle	.O
so	OU
it's	OO
quite	OO
complex	,O
but	OO
basically	OO
what	OO
happens	OO
is:	OO
a	OO
mosquito	OO
has	OO
to	OO
bite	OO
somebody	OO
to	OO
become	OO
infected	.O
once	OU
it	OO
bites	OO
an	OO
infected	OO
person	,O
the	OO
parasites	OO
travel	OO
through	OO
the	OO
mouth	OO
part	OO
into	OO
the	OO
gut	,O
and	OO
then	OO
bursts	OO
through	OO
the	OO
gut	,O
creates	OO
cysts	,O
and	OO
then	OO
the	OO
parasites	OO
replicate	,O
and	OO
then	OO
they	OO
make	OO
a	OO
journey	OO
from	OO
the	OO
gut	OO
all	OO
the	OO
way	OO
to	OO
the	OO
salivary	OO
glands	,O
where	OO
they	OO
are	OO
then	OO
injected	OO
back	OO
into	OO
another	OO
person	OO
when	OO
the	OO
mosquito	OO
bites	OO
because	OO
it	OO
injects	OO
saliva	OO
as	OO
it	OO
bites	.O
then	OU
inside	OO
the	OO
human	OO
it	OO
goes	OO
through	OO
a	OO
whole	OO
other	OO
cycle	,O
a	OO
whole	OO
other	OO
part	OO
of	OO
the	OO
life	OO
cycle	.O
so	OU
it	OO
goes	OO
through	OO
a	OO
liver	OO
stage	,O
changes	OO
shape	OO
and	OO
then	OO
comes	OO
out	OO
into	OO
the	OO
bloodstream	OO
again	,O
and	OO
eventually	OO
that	OO
person	OO
will	OO
become	OO
infectious	.O
now	,U
one	OO
thing	OO
we	OO
know	OO
about	OO
the	OO
parasite	OO
world	OO
is	OO
that	OO
they	OO
are	OO
incredibly	OO
good	OO
at	OO
manipulating	OO
their	OO
hosts	OO
to	OO
enhance	OO
their	OO
own	OO
transmission	,O
to	OO
make	OO
sure	OO
that	OO
they	OO
get	OO
passed	OO
onwards	.O
if	OU
this	OO
was	OO
to	OO
happen	OO
in	OO
the	OO
malaria	OO
system	,O
it	OO
might	OO
make	OO
sense	OO
that	OO
it	OO
would	OO
be	OO
something	OO
to	OO
do	OO
with	OO
odour	OO
that	OO
they	OO
manipulate	OO
because	OO
odour	OO
is	OO
the	OO
key	,O
odour's	OO
the	OO
thing	OO
that	OO
links	OO
us	OO
between	OO
mosquitoes;	OO
that's	OO
how	OO
they	OO
find	OO
us	.O
this	OU
is	OO
what	OO
we	OO
call	OO
the	OO
malaria	OO
manipulation	OO
hypothesis	,O
and	OO
it's	OO
something	OO
that	OO
we've	OO
been	OO
working	OO
on	OO
over	OO
the	OO
last	OO
few	OO
years	.O
so	OU
one	OO
of	OO
the	OO
first	OO
things	OO
that	OO
we	OO
wanted	OO
to	OO
do	OO
in	OO
our	OO
study	OO
was	OO
to	OO
find	OO
out	OO
whether	OO
an	OO
infection	OO
with	OO
malaria	OO
actually	OO
makes	OO
you	OO
more	OO
attractive	OO
to	OO
mosquitoes	OO
or	OO
not	.O
so	OU
in	OO
kenya	OU
with	OO
our	OO
colleagues	,O
we	OO
designed	OO
an	OO
experiment	OO
where	OO
we	OO
had	OO
participants	,O
children	OO
in	OO
kenya	,U
sleep	OO
inside	OO
tents	.O
the	OU
odour	OO
from	OO
the	OO
tent	OO
was	OO
blown	OO
into	OO
a	OO
chamber	OO
which	OO
contained	OO
mosquitoes	.O
and	OU
the	OO
mosquitoes	OO
would	OO
behaviourally	OO
respond	OO
they	OO
would	OO
fly	OO
towards	OO
or	OO
fly	OO
away	OO
from	OO
the	OO
odours	OO
depending	OO
on	OO
whether	OO
they	OO
liked	OO
them	OO
or	OO
not	.O
now	,U
some	OO
of	OO
the	OO
participants	OO
were	OO
infected	OO
with	OO
malaria	OO
and	OO
some	OO
of	OO
them	OO
were	OO
uninfected	.O
but	OU
importantly	,O
none	OO
of	OO
the	OO
children	OO
had	OO
any	OO
symptoms	OO
whatsoever	.O
now	,U
when	OO
we	OO
found	OO
and	OO
saw	OO
the	OO
results	,O
it	OO
was	OO
really	OO
quite	OO
staggering	.O
people	OU
who	OO
were	OO
infected	OO
with	OO
malaria	OO
were	OO
significantly	OO
more	OO
attractive	OO
than	OO
people	OO
who	OO
were	OO
uninfected	.O
let	OU
me	OO
explain	OO
this	OO
graph	.O
we	OU
have	OO
a	OO
number	OO
of	OO
mosquitoes	OO
attracted	OO
to	OO
the	OO
child	,O
and	OO
we	OO
have	OO
two	OO
sets	OO
of	OO
data:	OO
before	OO
treatment	OO
and	OO
after	OO
treatment	.O
on	OU
the	OO
far	OO
left	OO
hand	OO
side	,O
that	OO
bar	OO
represents	OO
somebody	OO
or	OO
a	OO
group	OO
of	OO
people	OO
who	OO
are	OO
uninfected	.O
and	OU
as	OO
we	OO
move	OO
towards	OO
the	OO
right	OO
hand	OO
side	OO
these	OO
people	OO
have	OO
become	OO
infected	,O
and	OO
they're	OO
moving	OO
towards	OO
the	OO
stage	OO
that	OO
they're	OO
infectious	.O
so	OU
right	OO
at	OO
the	OO
stage	OO
when	OO
people	OO
are	OO
infectious	OO
is	OO
when	OO
they	OO
are	OO
significantly	OO
more	OO
attractive	.O
in	OU
this	OO
study	OO
then	OO
what	OO
we	OO
did	OO
is	OO
we	OO
obviously	OO
gave	OO
the	OO
children	OO
treatment	OO
to	OO
clear	OO
the	OO
parasites	,O
and	OO
then	OO
we	OO
tested	OO
them	OO
again	.O
and	OU
what	OO
we	OO
found	OO
was	OO
that	OO
highly	OO
attractive	OO
trait	OO
that	OO
was	OO
there	OO
disappeared	OO
after	OO
they	OO
had	OO
cleared	OO
the	OO
infection	,O
so	OO
it	OO
wasn't	OO
just	OO
that	OO
the	OO
people	OO
were	OO
more	OO
attractive	,O
it	OO
was	OO
that	OO
the	OO
parasite	OO
was	OO
manipulating	OO
its	OO
host	OO
in	OO
some	OO
way	OO
to	OO
make	OO
it	OO
more	OO
attractive	OO
to	OO
mosquitoes	,O
standing	OO
out	OO
like	OO
a	OO
beacon	OO
to	OO
attract	OO
more	OO
mosquitoes	OO
so	OO
that	OO
it	OO
could	OO
continue	OO
its	OO
life	OO
cycle	.O
the	OU
next	OO
thing	OO
we	OO
wanted	OO
to	OO
do	OO
was	OO
find	OO
out	OO
what	OO
it	OO
was	OO
the	OO
mosquito	OO
was	OO
actually	OO
smelling	.O
what	OU
was	OO
it	OO
detecting	?O
so	OU
to	OO
do	OO
that	OO
we	OO
had	OO
to	OO
collect	OO
the	OO
body	OO
odour	OO
from	OO
the	OO
participants	.O
and	OU
we	OO
did	OO
this	OO
by	OO
wrapping	OO
bags	OO
around	OO
their	OO
feet	,O
which	OO
allowed	OO
us	OO
to	OO
collect	OO
the	OO
volatile	OO
odours	OO
from	OO
their	OO
feet	.O
and	OU
feet's	OO
really	OO
important	OO
to	OO
mosquitoes	.O
they	OU
really	OO
love	OO
the	OO
smell	OO
of	OO
feet	.O
especially	OU
cheesy	OO
feet	.O
anybody	OU
got	OO
cheesy	OO
feet	OO
out	OO
there	?O
mosquitoes	OU
love	OO
that	OO
smell	.O
so	OU
we	OO
focused	OO
on	OO
the	OO
feet	OO
and	OO
we	OO
collected	OO
the	OO
body	OO
odour	.O
now	,U
when	OO
it	OO
comes	OO
to	OO
mosquitoes	OO
and	OO
olfaction	,O
their	OO
sense	OO
of	OO
smell	,O
it's	OO
very	OO
complex	.O
it	OU
would	OO
be	OO
really	OO
nice	OO
if	OO
there	OO
was	OO
just	OO
one	OO
chemical	OO
that	OO
they	OO
detected	,O
but	OO
it's	OO
not	OO
that	OO
simple	.O
they	OU
have	OO
to	OO
detect	OO
a	OO
number	OO
of	OO
chemicals	OO
in	OO
the	OO
right	OO
concentration	,O
the	OO
right	OO
ratios	,O
the	OO
right	OO
combinations	OO
of	OO
chemicals	.O
so	OU
you	OO
can	OO
sort	OO
of	OO
think	OO
about	OO
it	OO
like	OO
a	OO
musical	OO
composition	.O
so	,U
you	OO
know	,O
if	OO
you	OO
get	OO
the	OO
note	OO
wrong	OO
or	OO
you	OO
play	OO
it	OO
too	OO
loud	OO
or	OO
too	OO
soft	,O
it	OO
doesn't	OO
sound	OO
right	.O
or	OU
a	OO
recipe	,O
if	OO
you	OO
get	OO
an	OO
ingredient	OO
wrong	,O
or	OO
you	OO
cook	OO
it	OO
too	OO
long	OO
or	OO
too	OO
little	,O
it	OO
doesn't	OO
taste	OO
right	.O
well	,U
smell	OO
is	OO
the	OO
same	,O
it's	OO
made	OO
up	OO
of	OO
a	OO
suite	OO
of	OO
chemicals	OO
in	OO
the	OO
right	OO
combination	.O
now	,U
our	OO
machines	OO
in	OO
the	OO
lab	OO
are	OO
not	OO
particularly	OO
good	OO
at	OO
picking	OO
out	OO
this	OO
sort	OO
of	OO
signal;	OO
it's	OO
quite	OO
complex	.O
but	OU
animals	OO
can	.O
and	OU
what	OO
we	OO
do	OO
in	OO
my	OO
laboratory	OO
is	OO
we	OO
connect	OO
microelectrodes	OO
to	OO
the	OO
antenna	OO
of	OO
a	OO
mosquito	OO
imagine	OO
how	OO
fiddly	OO
that	OO
is	.O
but	OU
what	OO
we	OO
also	OO
do	OO
is	OO
connect	OO
them	OO
to	OO
individual	OO
cells	OO
within	OO
the	OO
antenna	,O
which	OO
is	OO
incredible	.O
you	OU
definitely	OO
don't	OO
want	OO
to	OO
sneeze	OO
when	OO
you're	OO
doing	OO
this	OO
experiment	,O
that's	OO
for	OO
sure	.O
but	OU
what	OO
this	OO
does	OO
is	OO
it	OO
allows	OO
us	OO
to	OO
measure	OO
the	OO
electrical	OO
response	OO
of	OO
the	OO
smell	OO
receptors	OO
in	OO
the	OO
antennae	,O
and	OO
so	OO
that	OO
we	OO
can	OO
see	OO
what	OO
a	OO
mosquito	OO
is	OO
smelling	.O
i'm	OU
going	OO
to	OO
show	OO
you	OO
what	OO
this	OO
looks	OO
like:	OO
here's	OO
an	OO
insect's	OO
cell	,O
and	OO
it's	OO
responding;	OO
it	OO
will	OO
respond	OO
in	OO
a	OO
second	OO
when	OO
i	OU
press	OO
this	OO
button	.O
you'll	OU
see	OO
it	OO
sort	OO
of	OO
ticking	OO
over	OO
with	OO
this	OO
response	.O
an	OU
odour	OO
will	OO
be	OO
blown	OO
over	OO
the	OO
cell	,O
and	OO
it	OO
will	OO
sort	OO
of	OO
go	OO
a	OO
bit	OO
crazy	,O
sort	OO
of	OO
blow	OO
a	OO
raspberry	.O
then	OU
it	OO
will	OO
go	OO
back	OO
to	OO
its	OO
resting	OO
potential	OO
when	OO
we	OO
stop	OO
the	OO
odour	.O
okay	,U
there	OO
we	OO
go	.O
so	OU
you	OO
can	OO
go	OO
home	OO
now	OO
and	OO
say	OO
that	OO
you've	OO
now	OO
seen	OO
an	OO
insect	OO
smelling	OO
and	OO
even	OO
hearing	OO
an	OO
insect	OO
smelling	.O
it's	OU
a	OO
weird	OO
concept	,O
isn't	OO
it	?O
but	OU
this	OO
works	OO
really	OO
well	,O
and	OO
this	OO
allows	OO
us	OO
to	OO
see	OO
what	OO
the	OO
insect	OO
is	OO
detecting	.O
now	,U
using	OO
this	OO
method	OO
with	OO
our	OO
malaria	OO
samples	,O
we	OO
were	OO
able	OO
to	OO
find	OO
out	OO
what	OO
the	OO
mosquito	OO
was	OO
detecting	.O
and	OU
we	OO
found	OO
the	OO
malaria	OO
associated	OO
compounds	OO
were	OO
a	OO
group	OO
of	OO
compounds	,O
mainly	OO
aldehydes	,O
a	OO
group	OO
of	OO
compounds	OO
that	OO
smelled	,O
that	OO
signified	OO
the	OO
malaria	OO
at	OO
signal	OO
here	.O
so	OU
now	OO
we	OO
know	OO
what	OO
the	OO
smell	OO
of	OO
malaria	OO
is	,O
and	OO
we've	OO
used	OO
the	OO
mosquito	OO
as	OO
a	OO
bio	OO
sensor	OO
to	OO
tell	OO
us	OO
what	OO
the	OO
smell	OO
of	OO
malaria	OO
actually	OO
is	.O
now	,U
i'd	OU
like	OO
to	OO
imagine	OO
that	OO
you	OO
could	,O
i	OU
don't	OO
know	,O
put	OO
a	OO
harness	OO
on	OO
a	OO
little	OO
mosquito	OO
and	,O
you	OO
know	,O
put	OO
it	OO
on	OO
a	OO
lead	OO
and	OO
take	OO
it	OO
out	OO
and	OO
see	OO
if	OO
we	OO
can	OO
sniff	OO
people	OO
in	OO
a	OO
community	OO
that	OO
goes	OO
on	OO
in	OO
my	OO
head	OO
and	OO
see	OO
whether	OO
we	OO
could	OO
actually	OO
find	OO
people	OO
with	OO
malaria	.O
but	,U
of	OO
course	,O
that's	OO
not	OO
really	OO
possible	.O
but	OU
there	OO
is	OO
an	OO
animal	OO
that	OO
we	OO
can	OO
do	OO
that	OO
with	.O
awww	.U
yes	.U
now	,U
dogs	OO
have	OO
an	OO
incredible	OO
sense	OO
of	OO
smell	,O
but	OO
there's	OO
something	OO
a	OO
little	OO
bit	OO
more	OO
special	OO
about	OO
them	,O
they	OO
have	OO
an	OO
ability	OO
to	OO
learn	.O
and	OU
most	OO
of	OO
you	OO
will	OO
be	OO
familiar	OO
with	OO
this	OO
concept	OO
at	OO
airports	,O
where	OO
dogs	OO
will	OO
go	OO
down	OO
a	OO
line	OO
and	OO
sniff	OO
out	OO
your	OO
luggage	OO
or	OO
yourself	OO
for	OO
drugs	OO
and	OO
explosives	OO
or	OO
even	OO
food	OO
as	OO
well	.O
so	OU
we	OO
wanted	OO
to	OO
know:	OO
could	OU
we	OO
actually	OO
train	OO
dogs	OO
to	OO
learn	OO
the	OO
smell	OO
of	OO
malaria	?O
and	OU
so	OO
we've	OO
been	OO
working	OO
with	OO
a	OO
charity	OO
called	OO
medical	OU
detection	OU
dogs	OU
to	OO
see	OO
whether	OO
we	OO
can	OO
train	OO
them	OO
to	OO
learn	OO
the	OO
smell	OO
of	OO
malaria	.O
and	OU
we	OO
went	OO
out	OO
to	OO
the	OO
gambia	OU
and	OO
did	OO
some	OO
more	OO
odour	OO
collection	OO
on	OO
children	OO
that	OO
were	OO
infected	OO
and	OO
uninfected	.O
but	OU
this	OO
time	OO
we	OO
collected	OO
their	OO
odour	OO
by	OO
making	OO
them	OO
wear	OO
socks	,O
nylon	OO
stockings	OO
to	OO
collect	OO
their	OO
body	OO
odour	,O
and	OO
we	OO
brought	OO
them	OO
back	OO
to	OO
the	OO
uk	,U
and	OO
then	OO
we	OO
handed	OO
them	OO
to	OO
this	OO
charity	OO
to	OO
run	OO
the	OO
experiment	.O
now	,U
i	OU
could	OO
show	OO
you	OO
a	OO
graph	OO
and	OO
tell	OO
you	OO
about	OO
how	OO
that	OO
experiment	OO
works	,O
but	OO
it'd	OO
be	OO
a	OO
bit	OO
dull	,O
wouldn't	OO
it	?O
now	,U
they	OO
do	OO
say	OO
never	OO
work	OO
with	OO
children	OO
or	OO
animals	OO
live	.O
but	OU
we're	OO
going	OO
to	OO
break	OO
that	OO
rule	OO
today	.O
so	,U
please	OO
welcome	OO
onto	OO
the	OO
stage	,O
freya	OU
and	OO
her	OO
trainer	,O
mark	,U
and	OO
sarah	.U
of	OU
course	OO
this	OO
is	OO
the	OO
real	OO
star	OO
of	OO
the	OO
show	.O
okay	OU
so	,O
now	OO
what	OO
i'm	OU
going	OO
to	OO
ask	OO
is	OO
if	OO
you	OO
can	OO
all	OO
just	OO
be	OO
a	OO
little	OO
bit	OO
quiet	,O
don't	OO
move	OO
around	OO
too	OO
much	.O
this	OU
is	OO
a	OO
very	OO
strange	OO
environment	OO
for	OO
freya	.U
she's	OU
having	OO
a	OO
good	OO
look	OO
at	OO
you	OO
guys	OO
now	.O
so	OU
let's	OO
stay	OO
as	OO
calm	OO
as	OO
possible;	OO
that	OO
would	OO
be	OO
great	.O
so	OU
what	OO
we're	OO
going	OO
to	OO
do	OO
here	OO
is	OO
we're	OO
going	OO
to	OO
ask	OO
freya	OU
to	OO
move	OO
down	OO
this	OO
line	OO
of	OO
contraptions	OO
here	.O
and	OU
in	OO
each	OO
one	OO
of	OO
these	OO
contraptions	OO
we	OO
have	OO
a	OO
pot	.O
in	OU
the	OO
pot	OO
is	OO
a	OO
sock	OO
that's	OO
been	OO
worn	OO
by	OO
a	OO
child	OO
in	OO
the	OU
gambia	.U
now	,U
three	OO
of	OO
the	OO
socks	OO
had	OO
been	OO
worn	OO
by	OO
children	OO
who	OO
were	OO
uninfected	,O
and	OO
just	OO
one	OO
of	OO
the	OO
socks	OO
was	OO
worn	OO
by	OO
a	OO
child	OO
who	OO
was	OO
infected	OO
with	OO
malaria	.O
so	OU
just	OO
as	OO
you'd	OO
see	OO
an	OO
airport	,O
imagine	OO
these	OO
were	OO
people	,O
and	OO
the	OO
dog	OO
is	OO
going	OO
to	OO
go	OO
down	OO
and	OO
have	OO
a	OO
good	OO
sniff	.O
and	OU
let's	OO
see	OO
if	OO
you	OO
can	OO
see	OO
when	OO
she	OO
senses	OO
the	OO
malaria	.O
and	OU
if	OO
she	OO
senses	OO
it	OO
in	OO
there	.O
this	OU
is	OO
a	OO
really	OO
tough	OO
test	OO
for	OO
her	OO
in	OO
this	OO
very	OO
strange	OO
environment	.O
so	OU
i'm	OU
going	OO
to	OO
hand	OO
over	OO
now	OO
to	OO
mark	.U
number	OU
three	.O
okay	,U
there	OO
we	OO
go	.O
i	OU
didn't	OO
know	OO
which	OO
pot	OO
that	OO
was	OO
in	.O
mark	OU
didn't	OO
know	OO
which	OO
pot	OO
that	OO
was	OO
in	.O
this	OU
was	OO
a	OO
blind	OO
test	,O
genuinely	.O
sarah	,U
was	OO
that	OO
correct	?O
that	OU
was	OO
correct	.O
well	OU
done	,O
freya	.U
that	OU
is	OO
fantastic	.O
whew	.U
that	OU
is	OO
really	OO
wonderful	.O
okay	,U
that's	OO
brilliant	.O
now	OU
what	OO
we're	OO
going	OO
to	OO
do	OO
is	OO
sarah's	OU
going	OO
to	OO
change	OO
the	OO
pots	OO
around	OO
a	OO
little	OO
bit;	OO
she's	OO
going	OO
to	OO
take	OO
the	OO
one	OO
with	OO
malaria	OO
away	.O
and	OU
we're	OO
just	OO
going	OO
to	OO
have	OO
four	OO
pots	OO
that	OO
are	OO
containing	OO
socks	OO
from	OO
children	OO
that	OO
had	OO
no	OO
malaria	.O
so	OU
in	OO
theory	,O
freya	OU
should	OO
go	OO
down	OO
the	OO
line	OO
and	OO
not	OO
stop	OO
at	OO
all	.O
this	OU
is	OO
really	OO
important	OO
because	OO
we	OO
also	OO
need	OO
to	OO
know	OO
people	OO
who	OO
are	OO
not	OO
infected;	OO
she	OO
needs	OO
to	OO
be	OO
able	OO
to	OO
do	OO
that	OO
correctly	OO
as	OO
well	.O
this	OU
is	OO
a	OO
really	OO
tough	OO
test	.O
these	OU
socks	OO
have	OO
been	OO
in	OO
the	OO
freezer	OO
for	OO
a	OO
couple	OO
of	OO
years	OO
now	.O
and	OU
this	OO
is	OO
a	OO
tiny	OO
bit	OO
of	OO
a	OO
sock	OO
as	OO
well	,O
so	OO
imagine	OO
if	OO
this	OO
was	OO
a	OO
whole	OO
person	OO
and	OO
they	OO
were	OO
giving	OO
off	OO
a	OO
big	OO
signal	.O
so	OU
this	OO
is	OO
really	OO
quite	OO
incredible	.O
okay	,U
over	OO
to	OO
you	,O
mark	.U
brilliant	.U
fantastic	.U
really	OU
super	.O
thank	OU
you	OO
so	OO
much	,O
guys	.O
big	OU
round	OO
of	OO
applause	OO
for	OO
freya	,U
mark	OU
and	OO
sarah	.U
well	OU
done	,O
guys	.O
what	OU
a	OO
good	OO
girl	.O
she's	OU
going	OO
to	OO
get	OO
a	OO
treat	OO
later	.O
fantastic	.U
so	,U
you've	OO
just	OO
seen	OO
that	OO
for	OO
your	OO
own	OO
eyes	.O
that	OU
was	OO
a	OO
real	OO
live	OO
demonstration	.O
i	OU
was	OO
quite	OO
nervous	OO
about	OO
it	.O
i'm	OU
so	OO
glad	OO
that	OO
it	OO
worked	.O
but	OU
it	OO
is	OO
really	OO
incredible	,O
and	OO
when	OO
we	OO
do	OO
this	,O
what	OO
we	OO
find	OO
is	OO
that	OO
these	OO
dogs	OO
can	OO
correctly	OO
tell	OO
us	OO
when	OO
somebody's	OO
infected	OO
with	OO
malaria	OO
81%	OO
of	OO
the	OO
time	.O
it's	OU
incredible	.O
92%	OO
of	OO
the	OO
time	,O
they	OO
can	OO
tell	OO
us	OO
correctly	OO
when	OO
somebody	OO
does	OO
not	OO
have	OO
an	OO
infection	.O
and	OU
those	OO
numbers	OO
are	OO
actually	OO
above	OO
the	OO
criteria	OO
set	OO
by	OO
the	OO
world	OU
health	OU
organization	OU
for	OO
a	OO
diagnostic	.O
so	OU
we	OO
really	OO
are	OO
looking	OO
at	OO
deploying	OO
dogs	OO
in	OO
countries	,O
and	OO
particularly	OO
at	OO
ports	OO
of	OO
entry	,O
to	OO
detect	OO
people	OO
who	OO
have	OO
malaria	.O
this	OU
could	OO
be	OO
a	OO
reality	.O
but	OU
we	OO
can't	OO
deploy	OO
dogs	OO
everywhere	.O
so	OU
what	OO
we're	OO
also	OO
looking	OO
to	OO
do	OO
and	OO
working	OO
on	OO
at	OO
the	OO
moment	OO
is	OO
the	OO
development	OO
of	OO
technology	,O
wearable	OO
tech	OO
that	OO
would	OO
empower	OO
the	OO
individual	OO
to	OO
allow	OO
them	OO
to	OO
self	OO
diagnose	.O
imagine	OU
a	OO
patch	OO
that	OO
you	OO
wear	OO
on	OO
the	OO
skin	OO
that	OO
would	OO
detect	OO
in	OO
your	OO
sweat	OO
when	OO
you're	OO
infected	OO
with	OO
malaria	OO
and	OO
change	OO
colour	.O
or	OU
something	OO
a	OO
little	OO
bit	OO
more	OO
technical	OO
perhaps	,O
a	OO
smartwatch	OO
that	OO
would	OO
alert	OO
you	OO
when	OO
you're	OO
infected	OO
with	OO
malaria	.O
and	OU
if	OO
we	OO
can	OO
do	OO
this	OO
digitally	,O
and	OO
we	OO
can	OO
collect	OO
data	,O
imagine	OO
the	OO
amount	OO
of	OO
data	OO
that	OO
we	OO
can	OO
collect	OO
on	OO
a	OO
global	OO
scale	.O
this	OU
could	OO
completely	OO
revolutionise	OO
the	OO
way	OO
that	OO
we	OO
track	OO
the	OO

of	OO
diseases	,O
the	OO
way	OO
that	OO
we	OO
target	OO
our	OO
control	OO
efforts	OO
and	OO
respond	OO
to	OO
disease	OO

ultimately	OO
helping	OO
to	OO

to	OO
the	OO
eradication	OO
of	OO
malaria	,O
and	OO
even	OO
beyond	OO
malaria	OO
for	OO
other	OO
diseases	OO
that	OO
we	OO
already	OO
know	OO
have	OO
a	OO
smell	.O
if	OU
we	OO
can	OO
harness	OO
the	OO
power	OO
of	OO
nature	OO
to	OO
find	OO
out	OO
what	OO
those	OO
smells	OO
are	,O
we	OO
could	OO
do	OO
this	OO
and	OO
make	OO
this	OO
a	OO
reality	.O
now	,U
as	OO
scientists	,O
we're	OO

with	OO
coming	OO
up	OO
with	OO

new	OO

to	OO
tackle	OO
some	OO
of	OO
the	OO
world's	OO

problems	.O
but	OU
what	OO
never	OO
ceases	OO
to	OO
amaze	OO
me	OO
is	OO
that	OO
often	,O
nature	OO

already	OO
done	OO
this	OO
for	OO
us	.O

the	OO

the	OO

they're	OU

the	OO

it's	OO
awful	OO
you	OO
can't	OO
do	OO
it	OO
in	OO

on	OO

a	OO

the	OU

about	OO

or	OU

as	OO
they	OO
prefer	OO
to	OO
call	OO
it	OO
in	OO
the	OO
us	.U
it's	OU
a	OO

explore	OO
the	OO
elaborate	OO
themes	,O

and	OO

of	OO

in	OO

because	OU

in	OO
the	OO

between	OO
the	OO
performative	OO
and	OO
the	OO
personal	.O
ordinary	OU
people	OO
in	OO
extraordinary	OO

and	OU
what	OO
struck	OO
me	OO
more	OO
than	OO
any	OO
other	OO
subject	OO
we've	OO
encountered	OO
on	OO
the	OO

the	OO
way	OO

as	OO
a	OO
tool	OO
for	OO

now	,U
you	OO
might	OO
be	OO
thinking	,O
what	OU
does	OO
dressing	OO
up	OO
have	OO
to	OO
do	OO
with	OO
the	OO
important	OO
business	OO
of	OO
politics	?O
and	OU
it	OO
does	OO
seem	OO
counterintuitive	.O
why	OU
dress	OO
silly	OO
in	OO
order	OO
to	OO
be	OO
taken	OO
seriously	?O
but	OU
from	OO
caped	OO
crusaders	OO
to	OO
modern	OO
suffragettes	,O
people	OO
are	OO
getting	OO
creative	OO
with	OO
costume	OO
to	OO
express	OO
their	OO
outrage	OO
and	OO
garner	OO
global	OO
attention	.O
and	OU
it's	OO
working	.O
it's	OU
worth	OO
saying	OO
here	OO
that	OO
fashion	OO
is	OO
often	OO
treated	OO
as	OO
a	OO
flimsy	,O
generally	OO
female	OO
distraction	OO
from	OO
the	OO
real	OO
issues	OO
of	OO
the	OO
day	,O
and	OO
despite	OO
being	OO
a	OO
three	OO
trillion	OO

industry	,O
it's	OO
often	OO
marginalized	OO
or	OO
dismissed	OO
in	OO
commentary	OO
about	OO
current	OO
affairs	.O
and	OU
yet	,O
every	OO
day	OO
each	OO
one	OO
of	OO
us	OO
uses	OO
what	OO
we	OO
wear	OO
as	OO
a	OO
tool	OO
for	OO
constructing	OO
our	OO
sense	OO
of	OO
self	,O
for	OO
literally	OO
fashioning	OO
our	OO
identities	.O
if	OU
fashion	OO
is	OO
considered	OO
frivolous	,O
then	OO
fancy	OO
dress	OO
is	OO
really	OO
frivolous	.O
right	?U
but	OU
actually	,O
it	OO
allows	OO
us	OO
to	OO
express	OO
the	OO
most	OO
extreme	OO
version	OO
of	OO
ourselves	.O
it	OU
allows	OO
us	OO
to	OO
be	OO
something	OO

something	OU
in	OO
between	,O
something	OO
in	OO

it	OO

something	OO

important	OO
about	OO
your	OO

it's	OO
this:	OO
anger	OO
is	OO
a	OO
powerful	OO
and	OO
healthy	OO
force	OO
in	OO
your	OO

it's	OU
good	OO
that	OO
you	OO

to	OO

it	.O

to	OO
understand	OO
all	OO
that	,O
we	OO

have	OO
to	OO
back	OO
up	OO

in	OO
the	OO

a	OU

of	OO

of	OO
an	OO
anger	OO
researcher	OO
named	OO
dr	.U

you	,O
it	OO

as	OO
simple	OO
as	OO
this:	OO
i	OU

mad	OO
when	OO

you	OU
hear	OO
it	OO
in	OO
the	OO
language	OO
people	OO

they	OU

things	OO
like	,O
it	OU
makes	OO
me	OO
so	OO
mad	OO
when	OO
people	OO

this	OO
slow	,O
or	,O
i	OU
got	OO
mad	OO
because	OO

or	OU
my	OO
favorite	,O
i	OU

an	OO

people	OO
just	OO
need	OO
to	OO
stop	OO
messing	OO
with	OO
me	.O
now	,U
in	OO
the	OO
spirit	OO
of	OO
better	OO
understanding	OO
those	OO
types	OO
of	OO
provocations	,O
i	OU
ask	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
people	,O
including	OO
my	OO
friends	OO
and	OO
colleagues	OO
and	OO
even	OO
family	,O
what	OU
are	OO
the	OO
things	OO
that	OO
really	OO
get	OO
to	OO
you	?O
what	OU
makes	OO
you	OO
mad	?O
by	OU
the	OO
way	,O
now	OO
is	OO
a	OO
good	OO
time	OO
to	OO
point	OO
out	OO
one	OO
of	OO
the	OO
advantages	OO
of	OO
being	OO
an	OO
anger	OO
researcher	OO
is	OO
that	OO
i've	OU
spent	OO
more	OO
than	OO
a	OO
decade	OO
generating	OO
a	OO
comprehensive	OO
list	OO
of	OO
all	OO
the	OO
things	OO
that	OO
really	OO
irritate	OO
my	OO
colleagues	.O
just	OU
in	OO
case	OO
i	OU
need	OO
it	.O
but	OU
their	OO
answers	OO
are	OO
fascinating	,O
because	OO
they	OO
say	OO
things	OO
like	,O
when	OO
my	OO
sports	OO
team	OO
loses	,O
people	OO
who	OO
chew	OO
too	OO
loudly	.O
that	OU
is	OO
surprisingly	OO
common	,O
by	OO
the	OO
way	.O
people	OU
who	OO
walk	OO
too	OO
slowly	,O
that	OO
one's	OO
mine	.O
and	OU
of	OO
course	,O
roundabouts	.O
roundabouts	OU
—	OO
i	OU
can	OO
tell	OO
you	OO
honestly	,O
there	OO
is	OO
no	OO
rage	OO
like	OO
roundabout	OO
rage	.O
sometimes	OU
their	OO
answers	OO
aren't	OO
minor	OO
at	OO
all	.O
sometimes	OU
they	OO
talk	OO
about	OO
racism	OO
and	OO
sexism	OO
and	OO
bullying	OO
and	OO
environmental	OO
destruction	OO
—	OO
big	,O
global	OO
problems	OO
we	OO
all	OO
face	.O
but	OU
sometimes	,O
their	OO
answers	OO
are	OO
very	OO
specific	,O
maybe	OO
even	OO
oddly	OO
specific	.O
that	OU
wet	OO
line	OO
you	OO
get	OO
across	OO
your	OO
shirt	OO
when	OO
you	OO
accidentally	OO
lean	OO
against	OO
the	OO
counter	OO
of	OO
a	OO
public	OO
bathroom	.O
super	OU
gross	,O
right	?O
or	OU
flash	OU
drives:	OO
there's	OO
only	OO
two	OO
ways	OO
to	OO
plug	OO
them	OO
in	,O
so	OO
why	OO
does	OO
it	OO
always	OO
take	OO
me	OO
three	OO
tries	?O
now	OU
whether	OO
it's	OO
minor	OO
or	OO
major	,O
whether	OO
it's	OO
general	OO
or	OO
specific	,O
we	OO
can	OO
look	OO
at	OO
these	OO
examples	OO
and	OO
we	OO
can	OO
tease	OO
out	OO
some	OO
common	OO
themes	.O
we	OU
get	OO
angry	OO
in	OO
situations	OO
that	OO
are	OO
unpleasant	,O
that	OO
feel	OO
unfair	,O
where	OO
our	OO
goals	OO
are	OO
blocked	,O
that	OO
could	OO
have	OO
been	OO
avoided	,O
and	OO
that	OO
leave	OO
us	OO
feeling	OO
powerless	.O
this	OU
is	OO
a	OO
recipe	OO
for	OO
anger	.O
but	OU
you	OO
can	OO
also	OO
tell	OO
that	OO
anger	OO
is	OO
probably	OO
not	OO
the	OO
only	OO
thing	OO
we're	OO
feeling	OO
in	OO
these	OO
situations	.O
anger	OU
doesn't	OO
happen	OO
in	OO
a	OO
vacuum	.O
we	OU
can	OO
feel	OO
angry	OO
at	OO
the	OO
same	OO
time	OO
that	OO
we're	OO
scared	OO
or	OO
sad	,O
or	OO
feeling	OO
a	OO
host	OO
of	OO
other	OO
emotions	.O
but	OU
here's	OO
the	OO
thing:	OO
these	OO
provocations	OO
—	OO
they	OO
aren't	OO
making	OO
us	OO
mad	.O
at	OU
least	OO
not	OO
on	OO
their	OO
own	,O
and	OO
we	OO
know	OO
that	,O
because	OO
if	OO
they	OO
were	,O
we'd	OO
all	OO
get	OO
angry	OO
over	OO
the	OO

things	,O

it's	OO

it's	OO
this:	OO
it's	OO
how	OO

how	OO

of	OO
it	OO
in	OO

when	OU

it	OO

that's	OU

it's	OO
when	OO

we	OU
decide	OO
what	OO

in	OO

with	OO

now	,U
to	OO

i	OU

somewhere	.O

that	OO

driving	.O
it's	OU
true	.O
you	OU
are	,O
by	OO

on	OO
your	OO

somewhere	,O
so	OO
everything	OO
that	OO
happens	OO
—	OO
traffic	,O
other	OO

road	OO
construction	OO
—	OO
it	OO
feels	OO

it's	OO

your	OO

there	OU

all	OO

the	OO

those	OO

you	,O

without	OO

who's	OO
violating	OO
those	OO
rules	?O
anonymous	OU
others	,O
people	OO
you	OO

never	OO
see	OO
again	,O
making	OO
them	OO
a	OO
very	OO
easy	OO
target	OO
for	OO
your	OO
wrath	.O
so	OU
you're	OO
driving	OO
somewhere	,O
thus	OO
teed	OO
up	OO
to	OO
be	OO
angry	,O
and	OO
the	OO
person	OO
in	OO

of	OO
you	OO
is	OO
driving	OO
well	OO
below	OO
the	OO
speed	OO
limit	.O
and	OU
it's	OO
frustrating	OO
because	OO
you	OO
can't	OO
really	OO
see	OO
why	OO
they're	OO
driving	OO
so	OO
slow	.O
that's	OU
primary	OO
appraisal	.O
you've	OU
looked	OO
at	OO
this	OO
and	OO
you've	OO
said	OO
it's	OO
bad	OO
and	OO
it's	OO

but	OU
maybe	OO
you	OO
also	OO
decide	OO
it's	OO
not	OO
that	OO
big	OO
a	OO
deal	.O
you're	OU
not	OO
in	OO
a	OO
hurry	,O
doesn't	OO
matter	.O
that's	OU
secondary	OO
appraisal	OO
—	OO
you	OO
don't	OO
get	OO
angry	.O
but	OU
now	OO
imagine	OO
you're	OO
on	OO
your	OO

to	OO
a	OO
job	OO

what	OU
that	OO
person	OO
is	OO
doing	,O
it	OO

right	?O
so	OU

appraisal	OO
doesn't	OO
change;	OO
still	OO
bad	,O
still	OO
blameworthy	.O
but	OU
your	OO
ability	OO

with	OO
it	OO

that	OO

the	OO
one	OO
where	OO

that	OO

there's	OO

they	OU

why	OO

they	OO
need	OO
to	OO

so	OO
i	OU

to	OO
this	OO

and	OU
finally	,O
inflammatory	OO
labeling	.O
they	OU
call	OO

or	OO
a	OO
whole	OO

of	OO
things	OO
i've	OU
been	OO
told	OO
i'm	OU
not	OO
allowed	OO
to	OO
say	OO
during	OO
this	OO
ted	OU
talk	.U
so	OU
for	OO
a	OO
long	OO
time	,O
psychologists	OO
have	OO
referred	OO
to	OO
these	OO
as	OO
cognitive	OO
distortions	OO
or	OO
even	OO
irrational	OO
beliefs	.O
and	OU
yeah	,O
sometimes	OO
they	OO
are	OO
irrational	.O
maybe	OU
even	OO
most	OO
of	OO
the	OO
time	.O
but	OU
sometimes	,O
these	OO
thoughts	OO
are	OO
totally	OO
rational	.O
there	OU
is	OO
unfairness	OO
in	OO
the	OO
world	.O
there	OU
are	OO
cruel	,O
selfish	OO
people	,O
and	OO
it's	OO
not	OO
only	OO
ok	OU
to	OO
be	OO
angry	OO
when	OO
we're	OO
treated	OO
poorly	,O
it's	OO
right	OO
to	OO
be	OO
angry	OO
when	OO
we're	OO
treated	OO
poorly	.O
if	OU
there's	OO
one	OO
thing	OO
i	OU
want	OO
you	OO
to	OO
remember	OO
from	OO
my	OO
talk	OO
today	,O
it's	OO
this:	OO
your	OO
anger	OO
exists	OO
in	OO
you	OO
as	OO
an	OO
emotion	OO
because	OO
it	OO
offered	OO
your	OO
ancestors	,O
both	OO
human	OO
and	OO
nonhuman	,O
with	OO
an	OO
evolutionary	OO
advantage	.O
just	OU
as	OO
your	OO
fear	OO
alerts	OO
you	OO
to	OO
danger	,O
your	OO
anger	OO
alerts	OO
you	OO
to	OO
injustice	.O
it's	OU
one	OO
of	OO
the	OO
ways	OO
your	OO
brain	OO
communicates	OO
to	OO
you	OO
that	OO
you	OO
have	OO
had	OO
enough	.O
what's	OU
more	,O
it	OO
energizes	OO
you	OO
to	OO
confront	OO
that	OO
injustice	.O
think	OU
for	OO
a	OO
second	OO
about	OO
the	OO
last	OO
time	OO
you	OO
got	OO
mad	.O
your	OU
heart	OO
rate	OO
increased	.O
your	OU
breathing	OO
increased	,O
you	OO
started	OO
to	OO
sweat	.O
that's	OU
your	OO
sympathetic	OO
nervous	OO
system	,O
otherwise	OO
known	OO
as	OO
your	OO
fight	OO
or	OO
flight	OO
system	,O
kicking	OO
in	OO
to	OO
offer	OO
you	OO
the	OO
energy	OO
you	OO
need	OO
to	OO
respond	.O
and	OU
that's	OO
just	OO
the	OO
stuff	OO
you	OO
noticed	.O
at	OU
the	OO
same	OO
time	,O
your	OO
digestive	OO
system	OO
slowed	OO
down	OO
so	OO
you	OO
could	OO
conserve	OO
energy	.O
that's	OU
why	OO
your	OO
mouth	OO
went	OO
dry	.O
and	OU
your	OO
blood	OO
vessels	OO
dilated	OO
to	OO
get	OO
blood	OO
to	OO
your	OO
extremities	.O
that's	OU
why	OO
your	OO
face	OO
went	OO
red	.O
it's	OU
all	OO
part	OO
of	OO
this	OO
complex	OO
pattern	OO
of	OO
physiological	OO
experiences	OO
that	OO
exist	OO
today	OO
because	OO
they	OO
helped	OO
your	OO
ancestors	OO
deal	OO
with	OO
cruel	OO
and	OO
unforgiving	OO
forces	OO
of	OO
nature	.O
and	OU
the	OO
problem	OO
is	OO
that	OO
the	OO
thing	OO
your	OO
ancestors	OO
did	OO
to	OO
deal	OO
with	OO
their	OO
anger	,O
to	OO
physically	OO
fight	,O
they	OO
are	OO
no	OO
longer	OO
reasonable	OO
or	OO
appropriate	.O
you	OU
can't	OO
and	OO
you	OO
shouldn't	OO
swing	OO
a	OO
club	OO
every	OO
time	OO
you're	OO
provoked	.O
but	OU
here's	OO
the	OO
good	OO
news	.O
you	OU
are	OO
capable	OO
of	OO
something	OO
your	OO
nonhuman	OO
ancestors	OO
weren't	OO
capable	OO
of	.O
and	OU
that	OO
is	OO
the	OO
capacity	OO
to	OO
regulate	OO
your	OO
emotions	.O
even	OU
when	OO
you	OO
want	OO
to	OO
lash	OO
out	,O
you	OO
can	OO
stop	OO
yourself	OO
and	OO
you	OO
can	OO
channel	OO
that	OO
anger	OO
into	OO
something	OO
more	OO
productive	.O
so	OU
often	OO
when	OO
we	OO
talk	OO
about	OO
anger	,O
we	OO
talk	OO
about	OO
how	OO
to	OO
keep	OO
from	OO
getting	OO
angry	.O
we	OU
tell	OO
people	OO
to	OO
calm	OO
down	OO
or	OO
relax	.O
we	OU
even	OO
tell	OO
people	OO
to	OO
let	OO
it	OO
go	.O
and	OU
all	OO
of	OO
that	OO
assumes	OO
that	OO
anger	OO
is	OO
bad	OO
and	OO
that	OO
it's	OO
wrong	OO
to	OO
feel	OO
it	.O
but	OU
instead	,O
i	OU
like	OO
to	OO
think	OO
of	OO
anger	OO
as	OO
a	OO
motivator	.O
the	OU
same	OO
way	OO
your	OO
thirst	OO
motivates	OO
you	OO
to	OO
get	OO
a	OO
drink	OO
of	OO
water	,O
the	OO
same	OO
way	OO
your	OO
hunger	OO
motivates	OO
you	OO
to	OO
get	OO
a	OO
bite	OO
to	OO
eat	,O
your	OO
anger	OO
can	OO
motivate	OO
you	OO
to	OO
respond	OO
to	OO
injustice	.O
because	OU
we	OO
don't	OO
have	OO
to	OO
think	OO
too	OO
hard	OO
to	OO
find	OO
things	OO
we	OO
should	OO
be	OO
mad	OO
about	.O
when	OU
we	OO
go	OO
back	OO
to	OO
the	OO
beginning	,O
yeah	,O
some	OO
of	OO
those	OO
things	,O
they're	OO
silly	OO
and	OO
not	OO
worth	OO
getting	OO
angry	OO
over	.O
but	OU
racism	,O
sexism	,O
bullying	,O
environmental	OO
destruction	,O
those	OO
things	OO
are	OO
real	,O
those	OO
things	OO
are	OO
terrible	,O
and	OO
the	OO
only	OO
way	OO
to	OO
fix	OO
them	OO
is	OO
to	OO
get	OO
mad	OO
first	OO
and	OO
then	OO
channel	OO
that	OO
anger	OO
into	OO
fighting	OO
back	.O
and	OU
you	OO
don't	OO
have	OO
to	OO
fight	OO
back	OO
with	OO
aggression	OO
or	OO
hostility	OO
or	OO
violence	.O
there	OU
are	OO
infinite	OO
ways	OO
that	OO
you	OO
can	OO
express	OO
your	OO
anger	.O
you	OU
can	OO
protest	,O
you	OO
can	OO
write	OO
letters	OO
to	OO
the	OO
editor	,O
you	OO
can	OO
donate	OO
to	OO
and	OO
volunteer	OO
for	OO
causes	,O
you	OO
can	OO
create	OO
art	,O
you	OO
can	OO
create	OO
literature	,O
you	OO
can	OO
create	OO
poetry	OO
and	OO
music	,O
you	OO
can	OO
create	OO
a	OO
community	OO
that	OO
cares	OO
for	OO
one	OO
another	OO
and	OO
does	OO
not	OO
allow	OO
those	OO
atrocities	OO
to	OO
happen	.O
so	OU
the	OO
next	OO
time	OO
you	OO
feel	OO
yourself	OO
getting	OO
angry	,O
instead	OO
of	OO
trying	OO
to	OO
turn	OO
it	OO
off	,O
i	OU
hope	OO
you'll	OO
listen	OO
to	OO
what	OO
that	OO
anger	OO
is	OO
telling	OO
you	.O
and	OU
then	OO
i	OU
hope	OO
you'll	OO
channel	OO
it	OO
into	OO
something	OO
positive	OO
and	OO
productive	.O
thank	OU
you	.O
my	OU
day	OO
starts	OO
just	OO
like	OO
yours	.O
when	OU
i	OU
wake	OO
up	OO
in	OO
the	OO
morning	,O
i	OU
check	OO
my	OO
phone	,O
and	OO
then	OO
i	OU
have	OO
a	OO
cup	OO
of	OO
coffee	.O
but	OU
then	OO
my	OO
day	OO
truly	OO
starts	.O
it	OU
may	OO
not	OO
be	OO
like	OO
yours	,O
because	OO
i	OU
live	OO
my	OO
life	OO
as	OO
an	OO
artwork	.O
picture	OU
yourself	OO
in	OO
a	OO
giant	OO

with	OO
all	OO
the	OO
beautiful	OO
things	OO
that	OO
you	OO
have	OO
ever	OO
seen	OO
in	OO
your	OO

then	OU
imagine	OO
that	OO
your	OO

is	OO
a	OO
canvas	.O
and	OU
on	OO
that	OO
canvas	,O
you	OO
have	OO
a	OO
mission	OO
to	OO
create	OO
a	OO
masterpiece	OO
using	OO
the	OO
contents	OO
of	OO
your	OO
giant	OO
jewelry	OO
box	.O
once	OU
you've	OO
created	OO
your	OO

you	OO
might	OO
think	,O
wow	,U
i	OU
created	OO
that	.O
this	OU
is	OO
who	OO
i	OU
am	OO
today	.O
then	OU
you	OO
would	OO
pick	OO
up	OO
your	OO
house	OO
keys	,O
walk	OO
out	OO
the	OO
door	OO
into	OO
the	OO
real	OO
world	,O
maybe	OO
take	OO
public	OO
transport	OO
to	OO
the	OO
center	OO
of	OO
the	OO
town	.O
possibly	OU
walk	OO
along	OO
the	OO
streets	OO
or	OO
even	OO
go	OO
shopping	.O
that's	OU
my	OO
life	,O
every	OO
day	.O
when	OU
i	OU
walk	OO
out	OO
the	OO

these	OO
artworks	OO
are	OO
me	.O
i	OU
am	OO
art	.O
i	OU
have	OO
lived	OO
as	OO
art	OO
my	OO
entire	OO
adult	OO
life	.O
living	OU
as	OO
art	OO
is	OO
how	OO
i	OU
became	OO
myself	.O
i	OU
was	OO
brought	OO
up	OO
in	OO
a	OO
small	OO
village	OO
called	OO
fillongley	,U
in	OO
england	,U
and	OO
it	OO
was	OO
last	OO
mentioned	OO
in	OO
the	OO
domesday	OU
book	,U
so	OO
that's	OO
the	OO
mentality	.O
i	OU
was	OO
raised	OO
by	OO
my	OO
grandparents	,O
and	OO
they	OO
were	OO
antiques	OO
dealers	,O
so	OO
i	OU
grew	OO
up	OO
surrounded	OO
by	OO
history	OO
and	OO
beautiful	OO
things	.O
i	OU
had	OO
the	OO
most	OO
amazing	OO
dress	OO
up	OO
box	.O
so	OU
as	OO
you	OO
can	OO
imagine	,O
it	OO
started	OO
then	.O
i	OU
moved	OO
to	OO
london	OU
when	OO
i	OU
was	OO
17	OO
to	OO
become	OO
a	OO
model	.O
and	OU
then	OO
i	OU
went	OO
to	OO
study	OO
photography	.O
i	OU
wasn't	OO
really	OO
happy	OO
with	OO
myself	OO
at	OO
the	OO
time	,O
so	OO
i	OU
was	OO
always	OO
looking	OO
for	OO
escapism	.O
i	OU
studied	OO
the	OO
works	OO
of	OO
david	OU
lachapelle	OU
and	OO
steven	OU
arnold	,U
photographers	OO
who	OO
both	OO
curated	OO
and	OO
created	OO
worlds	OO
that	OO
were	OO
mind	OO
blowing	OO
to	OO
me	.O
so	OU
i	OU
decided	OO
one	OO
day	OO
to	OO
cross	OO
over	OO
from	OO
the	OO
superficial	OO
fashion	OO
world	OO
to	OO
the	OO
superficial	OO
art	OO
world	.O
i	OU
decided	OO
to	OO
live	OO
my	OO
life	OO
as	OO
a	OO
work	OO
of	OO
art	.O
i	OU
spend	OO
hours	,O
sometimes	OO
months	,O
making	OO
things	.O
my	OU
go	OO
to	OO
tool	OO
is	OO
a	OO
safety	OO
pin	,O
like	OO
this	OO
—	OO
they're	OU
never	OO
big	OO
enough	.O
and	OU
i	OU
use	OO
my	OO
fabrics	OO
time	OO
and	OO
time	OO
again	,O
so	OO
i	OU
recycle	OO
everything	OO
that	OO
i	OU
use	.O
when	OU
i	OU
get	OO
dressed	OO
i'm	OU
guided	OO
by	OO
color	,O
texture	OO
and	OO
shape	.O
i	OU
rarely	OO
have	OO
a	OO
theme	.O
i	OU
find	OO
beautiful	OO
objects	OO
from	OO
all	OO
over	OO
the	OO
world	,O
and	OO
i	OU
curate	OO
them	OO
into	OO
3	OO
d	OU
tapestries	OO
over	OO
a	OO
base	OO
layer	OO
that	OO
covers	OO
my	OO
whole	OO
body	OO
shape	.O
because	OO
i'm	OU
not	OO
very	OO
happy	OO
with	OO
my	OO
body	.O
i	OU
ask	OO
myself	,O
should	OU
i	OU
take	OO
something	OO
off	OO
or	OO
should	OO
i	OU
put	OO
something	OO
on	?O
100	OO
pieces	,O
maybe	?O
and	OU
sometimes	,O
i	OU
do	OO
that	.O
i	OU
promise	OO
you	OO
it's	OO
not	OO
too	OO
uncomfortable	OO
—	OO
well	,O
just	OO
a	OO
little	OO
—	OO
i	OU
might	OO
have	OO
a	OO
safety	OO
pin	OO
poking	OO
at	OO
me	OO
sometimes	OO
when	OO
i'm	OU
having	OO
a	OO
conversation	OO
with	OO
you	,O
so	OO
i'll	OU
kind	OO
of	OO
go	OO
off	OO
—	OO
it	OU
usually	OO
takes	OO
me	OO
about	OO
20	OO
minutes	OO
to	OO
get	OO
ready	,O
which	OO
nobody	OO
ever	OO
believes	.O
it's	OU
true	OO
—	OO
sometimes	.O
so	,U
it's	OO
my	OO
version	OO
of	OO
a	OO
t	OO
shirt	OO
and	OO
jeans	.O
when	OU
i	OU
get	OO
dressed	,O
i	OU
build	OO
like	OO
an	OO
architect	.O
i	OU
carefully	OO
place	OO
things	OO
till	OO
i	OU
feel	OO
they	OO
belong	.O
then	,U
i	OU
get	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
my	OO
ideas	OO
from	OO
lucid	OO
dreaming	.O
i	OU
actually	OO
go	OO
to	OO
sleep	OO
to	OO
come	OO
up	OO
with	OO
my	OO
ideas	,O
and	OO
i've	OU
taught	OO
myself	OO
to	OO
wake	OO
up	OO
to	OO
write	OO
them	OO
down	.O
i	OU
wear	OO
things	OO
till	OO
they	OO
fall	OO
apart	,O
and	OO
then	,O
i	OU
give	OO
them	OO
a	OO
new	OO
life	.O
the	OU
gold	OO
outfit	,O
for	OO
example	OO
—	OO
it	OO
was	OO
the	OO
outfit	OO
that	OO
i	OU
wore	OO
to	OO
the	OO
houses	OU
of	OO
parliament	OU
in	OO
london	.U
it's	OU
made	OO
of	OO
armor	,O

and	OO
i	OU
was	OO
the	OO
first	OO
person	OO
to	OO
wear	OO
armor	OO
to	OO
parliament	OU
since	OO
oliver	OU
cromwell	OU
banned	OO
it	OO
in	OO
the	OO
17th	OO

things	OU

out	OO

or	OO
trash	OO
you	OO

out	OO
on	OO
the	OO

you	OU
never	OO
know	,O
they	OO
might	OO
end	OO
up	OO
on	OO
the	OO
pages	OO
of	OO
vogue	.U
there's	OU
over	OO
6,000	OO
pieces	OO
in	OO
my	OO
collection	,O
ranging	OO
from	OO
2,000	OO
year	OO
old	OO
roman	OU
rings	OO
to	OO
ancient	OO
buddhist	OU
artifacts	.O
i	OU
believe	OO
in	OO
sharing	OO
what	OO
i	OU
do	OO
and	OO
what	OO
i	OU
have	OO
with	OO
others	,O
so	OO
i	OU
decided	OO
to	OO
create	OO
an	OO
art	OO
exhibition	,O
which	OO
is	OO
currently	OO
traveling	OO
to	OO
museums	OO
around	OO
the	OO
world	.O
it	OU
contains	OO
an	OO
army	OO
of	OO
me	OO
—	OO
life	OO
size	OO
sculptures	OO
as	OO
you	OO
can	OO
see	OO
behind	OO
me	,O
they're	OO
here	OO
—	OO
they	OO
are	OO
my	OO
life	,O
really	.O
they're	OU
kind	OO
of	OO
like	OO
3	OO
d	OU
tapestries	OO
of	OO
my	OO
existence	OO
as	OO
living	OO
as	OO
art	.O
they	OU
contain	OO
plastic	OO
crystals	OO
mixed	OO
with	OO
diamonds	,O
beer	OO
cans	OO
and	OO
royal	OO
silks	OO
all	OO
in	OO
one	OO
look	.O
i	OU
like	OO
the	OO
fact	OO
that	OO
the	OO
viewer	OO
can	OO
never	OO
make	OO
the	OO
assumption	OO
about	OO
what's	OO
real	OO
and	OO
what's	OO
fake	.O
i	OU
find	OO
it	OO
important	OO
to	OO
explore	OO
and	OO
share	OO
cultures	OO
through	OO
my	OO
works	.O
i	OU
use	OO
clothing	OO
as	OO
a	OO
means	OO
to	OO
investigate	OO
and	OO
appreciate	OO
people	OO
from	OO
all	OO
over	OO
the	OO
world	.O
sometimes	,U
people	OO
think	OO
i'm	OU
a	OO
performer	OO
or	OO
a	OO
drag	OO
queen	.O
i'm	OU
not	.O
although	OU
my	OO
life	OO
appears	OO
to	OO
be	OO
a	OO
performance	,O
it's	OO
not	.O
it's	OU
very	OO
real	.O
people	OU
respond	OO
to	OO
me	OO
as	OO
they	OO
would	OO
any	OO
other	OO
type	OO
of	OO
artwork	.O
many	OU
people	OO
are	OO
fascinated	OO
and	OO
engaged	.O
some	OU
people	OO
walk	OO
around	OO
me	,O
staring	,O
shy	OO
at	OO
first	.O
then	OU
they	OO
come	OO
up	OO
to	OO
me	OO
and	OO
they	OO
say	OO
they	OO
love	OO
or	OO
absolutely	OO
hate	OO
what	OO
i	OU
do	.O
i	OU
sometimes	OO
respond	,O
and	OO
other	OO
times	OO
i	OU
let	OO
the	OO
art	OO
talk	OO
for	OO
itself	.O
the	OU
most	OO
annoying	OO
thing	OO
in	OO
the	OO
world	OO
is	OO
when	OO
people	OO
want	OO
to	OO
touch	OO
the	OO
artwork	.O
but	OU
i	OU
understand	.O
but	OU
like	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
contemporary	OO
art	,O
many	OO
people	OO
are	OO
dismissive	.O
some	OU
people	OO
are	OO
critical	,O
others	OO
are	OO
abusive	.O
i	OU
think	OO
it	OO
comes	OO
from	OO
the	OO
fear	OO
of	OO
the	OO
different	OO
—	OO
the	OO
unknown	.O
there	OU
are	OO
so	OO
many	OO
reactions	OO
to	OO
what	OO
i	OU
do	,O
and	OO
i've	OU
just	OO
learned	OO
not	OO
to	OO
take	OO
them	OO
personally	.O
i've	OU
never	OO
lived	OO
as	OO
daniel	OU
lismore	,U
the	OO
person	.O
i've	OU
lived	OO
as	OO
daniel	OU
lismore	,U
the	OO
artwork	.O
and	OU
i've	OU
faced	OO
every	OO
obstacle	OO
as	OO
an	OO
artwork	.O
it	OU
can	OO
be	OO
hard	.O
especially	OO
if	OO
your	OO
wardrobe	OO
takes	OO
up	OO
a	OO
40	OO
foot	OO
container	,O
three	OO
storage	OO
units	OO
and	OO
30	OO
boxes	OO
from	OO
ikea	OU
—	OO
and	OO
sometimes	,O
it	OO
can	OO
be	OO
very	OO
difficult	,O
getting	OO
into	OO
cars	,O
and	OO
sometimes	OO
—	OO
well	,O
this	OO
morning	OO
i	OU
didn't	OO
fit	OO
through	OO
my	OO
bathroom	OO
door	,O
so	OO
that	OO
was	OO
a	OO
problem	.O
what	OU
does	OO
it	OO
mean	OO
to	OO
be	OO
yourself	?O
people	OU
say	OO
it	OO
all	OO
the	OO
time	,O
but	OO
what	OO
does	OO
it	OO
truly	OO
mean	,O
and	OO
why	OO
does	OO
it	OO
matter	?O
how	OU
does	OO
life	OO
change	OO
when	OO
you	OO
choose	OO
to	OO
be	OO
unapologetically	OO
yourself	?O
i've	OU
had	OO
to	OO
face	OO
struggles	OO
and	OO
triumphs	OO
whilst	OO
living	OO
my	OO
life	OO
as	OO
art	.O
i've	OU
been	OO
put	OO
on	OO
private	OO
jets	OO
and	OO
flown	OO
around	OO
the	OO
world	.O
my	OU
work's	OO
been	OO
displayed	OO
in	OO
prestigious	OO
museums	,O
and	OO
i've	OU
had	OO
the	OO
opportunity	OO
—	OO
that	OO
is	OO
my	OO
grandparents	,O
by	OO
the	OO
way	,O
they're	OO
the	OO
people	OO
that	OO
raised	OO
me	,O
and	OO
there	OO
i	OU
am	OO
—	OO
so	OU
i've	OU
been	OO
put	OO
on	OO
private	OO
jets	,O
flown	OO
around	OO
the	OO
world	,O
and	OO
yet	,O
it's	OO
not	OO
been	OO
that	OO
easy	OO
because	OO
at	OO
times	,O
i've	OU
been	OO
homeless	,O
i've	OU
been	OO
spat	OO
at	,O
i've	OU
been	OO
abused	,O
sometimes	OO
daily	,O
bullied	OO
my	OO
entire	OO
life	,O
rejected	OO
by	OO
countless	OO
individuals	,O
and	OO
i've	OU
been	OO
stabbed	.O
but	OU
what	OO
hurt	OO
the	OO
most	OO
was	OO
being	OO
put	OO
on	OO
the	OO
worst	OU
dressed	OU
list	.O
it	OU
can	OO
be	OO
hard	,O
being	OO
yourself	,O
but	OO
i've	OU
found	OO
it's	OO
the	OO
best	OO
way	.O
there's	OU
the	OO
worst	OU
dressed	.U
as	OU
the	OO
quote	OO
goes	,O
everyone	OU
else	OO
is	OO
already	OO
taken	.O
i've	OU
come	OO
to	OO
realize	OO
that	OO
confidence	OO
is	OO
a	OO
concept	OO
you	OO
can	OO
choose	.O
i've	OU
come	OO
to	OO
realize	OO
that	OO
authenticity	OO
is	OO
necessary	,O
and	OO
it's	OO
powerful	.O
i've	OU
tried	OO
to	OO
spend	OO
time	OO
being	OO
like	OO
other	OO
people	.O
it	OU
didn't	OO
work	.O
it's	OU
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
hard	OO
work	,O
not	OO
being	OO
yourself	.O
i	OU
have	OO
a	OO
few	OO
questions	OO
for	OO
you	OO
all	.O
who	OU
are	OO
you	?O
how	OU
many	OO
versions	OO
of	OO
you	OO
are	OO
there	?O
and	OU
i	OU
have	OO
one	OO
final	OO
question:	OO
are	OU
you	OO
using	OO
them	OO
all	OO
to	OO
your	OO
advantage	?O
in	OU
reality	,O
everyone	OO
is	OO
capable	OO
of	OO
creating	OO
their	OO
own	OO
masterpiece	.O
you	OU
should	OO
try	OO
it	OO
sometime	.O
it's	OU
quite	OO
fun	.O
thank	OU
you	.O
so	OU
i	OU
know	OO
for	OO
sure	OO
there's	OO
at	OO
least	OO
one	OO
thing	OO
i	OU
have	OO
in	OO
common	OO
with	OO
dentists	.O
i	OU
absolutely	OO
hate	OO
the	OO
holiday	OO
of	OO
halloween	.U
now	,U
this	OO
hatred	OO
stems	OO
not	OO
from	OO
a	OO
dislike	OO
of	OO
cavities	,O
nor	OO
was	OO
it	OO
a	OO
lifetime	OO
in	OO
the	OO
making	.O
rather	,U
this	OO
hatred	OO
stems	OO
from	OO
a	OO
particular	OO
incident	OO
that	OO
happened	OO
nine	OO
years	OO
ago	.O
nine	OU
years	OO
ago	,O
i	OU
was	OO
even	OO
younger	,O
i	OU
was	OO
20	OO
years	OO
old	,O
and	OO
i	OU
was	OO
an	OO
intern	OO
in	OO
the	OO
white	OU
house	.U
the	OU
other	OO
white	OU
house	.U
and	OU
my	OO
job	OO
was	OO
to	OO
work	OO
with	OO
mayors	OO
and	OO
councilors	OO
nationwide	.O
november	OU
1	,O
2010	OO
began	OO
just	OO
like	OO
any	OO
other	OO
day	.O
i	OU
turned	OO
on	OO
the	OO
computer	,O
went	OO
on	OO
google	OU
and	OO
prepared	OO
to	OO
write	OO
my	OO
news	OO
clips	.O
i	OU
was	OO
met	OO
with	OO
a	OO
call	OO
from	OO
my	OO
mother	,O
which	OO
isn't	OO
that	OO
out	OO
the	OO
norm	,O
my	OO
mom	OO
likes	OO
to	OO
text	,O
call	,O
email	,O
facebook	,U
instagram	,U
all	OO
that	.O
so	OU
i	OU
answered	OO
the	OO
phone	OO
expecting	OO
to	OO
hear	OO
maybe	OO
some	OO
church	OO
gossip	,O
or	OO
maybe	OO
something	OO
from	OO
worldstarhiphop	OU
she	OO
had	OO
discovered	.O
but	OU
when	OO
i	OU
answered	OO
the	OO
phone	,O
i	OU
was	OO
met	OO
with	OO
a	OO
tone	OO
that	OO
was	OO
unlike	OO
anything	OO
i	OU
had	OO
ever	OO
heard	OO
from	OO
my	OO
mother	.O
my	OU
mother's	OO
loud	.O
but	OU
she	OO
spoke	OO
in	OO
a	OO
hush	,O
still	,O
muffled	OO
tone	OO
that	OO
conveyed	OO
a	OO
sense	OO
of	OO
sadness	.O
and	OU
as	OO
she	OO
whispered	,O
she	OO
said	,O
michael	,U
your	OO
cousin	OO
donnell	OU
was	OO
murdered	OO
last	OO
night	,O
on	OO
halloween	,U
at	OO
a	OO
house	OO
party	OO
in	OO
stockton	.U
and	OU
like	OO
far	OO
too	OO
many	OO
people	OO
in	OO
this	OO
country	,O
particularly	OO
from	OO
communities	OO
like	OO
mine	,O
particularly	OO
that	OO
look	OO
like	OO
me	,O
i	OU
spent	OO
the	OO
better	OO
part	OO
of	OO
the	OO
year	OO
dealing	OO
with	OO
anger	,O
rage	,O
nihilism	,O
and	OO
i	OU
had	OO
a	OO
choice	OO
to	OO
make	.O
the	OU
choice	OO
was	OO
one	OO
between	OO
action	OO
and	OO
apathy	.O
the	OU
choice	OO
was	OO
what	OO
could	OO
i	OU
do	OO
to	OO
put	OO
purpose	OO
to	OO
this	OO
pain	.O
i	OU
spent	OO
a	OO
year	OO
dealing	OO
with	OO
feelings	OO
of	OO
survivor's	OO
guilt	.O
what	OU
was	OO
the	OO
point	OO
of	OO
me	OO
being	OO
at	OO
stanford	,U
what	OO
was	OO
the	OO
point	OO
of	OO
me	OO
being	OO
at	OO
the	OO
white	OU
house	OU
if	OO
i	OU
was	OO
powerless	OO
to	OO
help	OO
my	OO
own	OO
family	?O
and	OU
my	OO
own	OO
family	OO
was	OO
dying	,O
quite	OO
literally	.O
i	OU
then	OO
began	OO
to	OO
feel	OO
a	OO
little	OO
selfish	OO
and	OO
say	,O
what's	OO
the	OO
point	OO
of	OO
even	OO
trying	OO
to	OO
make	OO
the	OO
world	OO
a	OO
better	OO
place	?O
maybe	OU
that's	OO
just	OO
the	OO
way	OO
it	OO
is	.O
maybe	OU
i	OU
would	OO
be	OO
smart	OO
to	OO
take	OO
advantage	OO
of	OO
all	OO
the	OO
opportunities	OO
given	OO
to	OO
me	OO
and	OO
make	OO
as	OO
much	OO
money	OO
as	OO
possible	,O
so	OO
i'm	OU
comfortable	,O
and	OO
my	OO
immediate	OO
family	OO
is	OO
comfortable	.O
but	OU
finally	,O
towards	OO
the	OO
end	OO
of	OO
that	OO
year	,O
i	OU
realized	OO
i	OU
wanted	OO
to	OO
do	OO
something	.O
so	OU
i	OU
made	OO
the	OO
crazy	OO
decision	,O
as	OO
a	OO
senior	OO
in	OO
college	,O
to	OO
run	OO
for	OO
city	OO
council	.O
that	OU
decision	OO
was	OO
unlikely	OO
for	OO
a	OO
couple	OO
of	OO
reasons	,O
and	OO
not	OO
just	OO
my	OO
age	.O
you	OU
see	,O
my	OO
family	OO
is	OO
far	OO
from	OO
a	OO
political	OO
dynasty	.O
more	OU
men	OO
in	OO
my	OO
family	OO
have	OO
been	OO
incarcerated	OO
than	OO
in	OO
college	.O
in	OU
fact	,O
as	OO
i	OU
speak	OO
today	,O
my	OO
father	OO
is	OO
still	OO
incarcerated	.O
my	OU
mother	,O
she	OO
had	OO
me	OO
as	OO
a	OO
teenager	,O

government	OO
wasn't	OO
something	OO
we	OO
had	OO
warm	OO
feelings	OO
from	.O
you	OU
see	,O
it	OO
was	OO
the	OO
government	OO
that	OO
red	OO

the	OO

i	OU
grew	OO
up	OO
in	.O
full	OU
of	OO
liquor	OO

and	OO
no	OO
grocery	OO

there	OO
was	OO
a	OO
lack	OO
of	OO
opportunity	OO
and	OO
concentrated	OO
poverty	.O
it	OU
was	OO
the	OO
government	OO
and	OO
the	OO
politicians	OO
that	OO
made	OO
choices	,O
like	OO
the	OO
war	OO
on	OO

and	OO
three	OO

that	OO
have	OO
incarcerated	OO
far	OO
too	OO
many	OO
people	OO
in	OO
our	OO
country	.O
it	OU
was	OO
the	OO
government	OO

political	OO
actors	OO
that	OO
made	OO
the	OO
decisions	OO
that	OO
created	OO
the	OO

that	OO

it	OO

the	OO

to	OO

less	OO

so	OU
there	OO
was	OO
nothing	OO
about	OO

that	OO

it	OO

for	OO
me	OO
to	OO
choose	OO
to	OO

in	OO
being	OO
a	OO
government	OO
actor	.O
and	OU
at	OO
the	OO

stockton	OU
was	OO
a	OO
very	OO
unlikely	OO
place	.O
stockton	OU
is	OO
my	OO
home	OO
town	,O
a	OO
city	OO
of	OO
320,000	OO

but	OU
historically	,O
it's	OO
been	OO
a	OO
place	OO
people	OO
run	OO
from	,O
rather	OO
than	OO
come	OO
back	OO
to	.O
it's	OU
a	OO

at	OO

we	OO
were	OO
also	OO
the	OO

in	OO
the	OO

at	OO
that	OO

to	OO

at	OU

we	OO

at	OU
the	OO

of	OO

issues	OO
beyond	OO
the	OO

any	OO
21	OO

so	OU
after	OO
i	OU
won	OO
my	OO
election	,O
i	OU
did	OO
what	OO
i	OU
usually	OO
do	OO
when	OO
i	OU
feel	OO
overwhelmed	,O
i	OU
realized	OO
the	OO
problems	OO
of	OO
stockton	OU
were	OO
far	OO
bigger	OO
than	OO
me	OO
and	OO
that	OO
i	OU
might	OO
need	OO
a	OO
little	OO
divine	OO
intervention	.O
so	OU
as	OO
i	OU
prepared	OO
for	OO
my	OO
first	OO
council	OO
meeting	,O
i	OU
went	OO
back	OO
to	OO
some	OO
wisdom	OO
my	OO
grandmother	OO
taught	OO
me	.O
a	OU
parable	OO
i	OU
think	OO
we	OO
all	OO
know	,O
that	OO
really	OO
constitutes	OO
the	OO
governing	OO
frame	OO
we're	OO
using	OO
to	OO
reinvent	OO
stockton	OU
today	.O
i	OU
remember	OO
in	OO
sunday	OU
school	,O
my	OO
grandmother	OO
told	OO
me	OO
that	OO
at	OO
one	OO
time	,O
a	OO
guy	OO
asked	OO
jesus	,U
who	OU
was	OO
my	OO
neighbor	?O
who	OU
was	OO
my	OO
fellow	OO
citizen	?O
who	OU
am	OO
i	OU
responsible	OO
for	?O
and	OU
instead	OO
of	OO
a	OO
short	OO
answer	,O
jesus	OU
replied	OO
with	OO
a	OO
parable	.O
he	OU
said	OO
there	OO
was	OO
a	OO
man	OO
on	OO
a	OO
journey	,O
walking	OO
down	OO
jericho	OU
road	.U
as	OU
he	OO
was	OO
walking	OO
down	OO
the	OO
road	,O
he	OO
was	OO
beat	OO
up	,O
left	OO
on	OO
the	OO
side	OO
of	OO
the	OO
road	,O
stripped	OO
of	OO
all	OO
his	OO
clothes	,O
had	OO
everything	OO
stolen	OO
from	OO
and	OO
left	OO
to	OO
die	.O
and	OU
then	OO
a	OO
priest	OO
came	OO
by	,O
saw	OO
the	OO
man	OO
on	OO
the	OO
side	OO
of	OO
the	OO
road	,O
maybe	OO
said	OO
a	OO
silent	OO
prayer	,O
hopes	OO
and	OO
prayers	,O
prayers	OO
that	OO
he	OO
gets	OO
better	.O
maybe	OU
saw	OO
the	OO
man	OO
on	OO
the	OO
side	OO
of	OO
the	OO
road	OO
and	OO
surmised	OO
that	OO
it	OO
was	OO
ordained	OO
by	OO
god	OU
for	OO
this	OO
particular	OO
man	,O
this	OO
particular	OO
group	OO
to	OO
be	OO
on	OO
the	OO
side	OO
of	OO
the	OO
road	,O
there's	OO
nothing	OO
i	OU
can	OO
do	OO
to	OO
change	OO
it	.O
after	OU
the	OO
priest	OO
walked	OO
by	,O
maybe	OO
a	OO
politician	OO
walked	OO
by	.O
a	OU
28	OO
year	OO
old	OO
politician	,O
for	OO
example	.O
saw	OU
the	OO
man	OO
on	OO
the	OO
side	OO
of	OO
the	OO
road	OO
and	OO
saw	OO
how	OO
beat	OO
up	OO
the	OO
man	OO
was	,O
saw	OO
that	OO
the	OO
man	OO
was	OO
a	OO
victim	OO
of	OO
violence	,O
or	OO
fleeing	OO
violence	.O
and	OU
the	OO
politician	OO
decided	,O
you	OU
know	OO
what	?O
instead	OU
of	OO
welcoming	OO
this	OO
man	OO
in	,O
let's	OO
build	OO
a	OO
wall	.O
maybe	OU
the	OO
politician	OO
said	,O
maybe	OU
this	OO
man	OO
chose	OO
to	OO
be	OO
on	OO
the	OO
side	OO
of	OO
the	OO
road	.O
that	OU
if	OO
he	OO
just	OO
pulled	OO
himself	OO
up	OO
by	OO
his	OO
bootstraps	,O
despite	OO
his	OO
boots	OO
being	OO
stolen	,O
and	OO
got	OO
himself	OO
back	OO
on	OO
the	OO
horse	,O
he	OO
could	OO
be	OO
successful	,O
and	OO
there's	OO
nothing	OO
i	OU
could	OO
do	.O
and	OU
then	OO
finally	,O
my	OO
grandmother	OO
said	,O
a	OO
good	OO
samaritan	OU
came	OO
by	,O
saw	OO
the	OO
man	OO
on	OO
the	OO
side	OO
of	OO
the	OO
road	OO
and	OO
looked	OO
and	OO
saw	OO
not	OO
centuries	OO
of	OO
hatred	OO
between	OO
jews	OU
and	OO
samaritans	,U
looked	OO
and	OO
saw	OO
not	OO
his	OO
fears	OO
reflected	,O
not	OO
economic	OO
anxiety	,O
not	OO
what's	OO
going	OO
to	OO
happen	OO
to	OO
me	OO
because	OO
things	OO
are	OO
changing	.O
but	OU
looked	OO
and	OO
saw	OO
a	OO
reflection	OO
of	OO
himself	.O
he	OU
saw	OO
his	OO
neighbor	,O
he	OO
saw	OO
his	OO
common	OO
humanity	.O
he	OU
didn't	OO
just	OO
see	OO
it	,O
he	OO
did	OO
something	OO
about	OO
it	,O
my	OO
grandmother	OO
said	.O
he	OU
got	OO
down	OO
on	OO
one	OO
knee	,O
he	OO
made	OO
sure	OO
the	OO
man	OO
was	OO
ok	,U
and	OO
i	OU
heard	,O
even	OO
gave	OO
him	OO
a	OO
room	OO
at	OO
that	OO
nice	OO
fairmont	,U
the	OO
pan	OU
pacific	OU
one	.O
and	OU
as	OO
i	OU
prepared	OO
to	OO
govern	,O
i	OU
realized	OO
that	OO
given	OO
the	OO
diversity	OO
of	OO
stockton	,U
the	OO
first	OO
step	OO
to	OO
making	OO
change	OO
will	OO
be	OO
to	OO
again	OO
answer	OO
the	OO
same	OO
question:	OO
who	OU
is	OO
our	OO
neighbor	?O
and	OU
realizing	OO
that	OO
our	OO
destiny	OO
as	OO
a	OO
city	OO
was	OO
tied	OO
up	OO
in	OO
everyone	.O
particularly	OU
those	OO
who	OO
are	OO
left	OO
on	OO
the	OO
side	OO
of	OO
the	OO
road	.O
but	OU
then	OO
i	OU
realized	OO
that	OO
charity	OO
isn't	OO
justice	,O
that	OO
acts	OO
of	OO
empathy	OO
isn't	OO
justice	,O
that	OO
being	OO
a	OO
good	OO
neighbor	OO
is	OO
necessary	OO
but	OO
not	OO
sufficient	,O
and	OO
there	OO
was	OO
more	OO
that	OO
had	OO
to	OO
be	OO
done	.O
so	OU
looking	OO
at	OO
the	OO
story	,O
i	OU
realized	OO
that	OO
the	OO
road	,O
jericho	OU
road	,U
has	OO
a	OO
nickname	.O
it's	OU
known	OO
as	OO
the	OO
bloody	OU
pass	,U
the	OO
ascent	OU
of	OO
red	,U
because	OO
the	OO
road	OO
is	OO
structured	OO
for	OO
violence	.O
this	OU
jericho	OU
road	OU
is	OO
narrow	,O
it's	OO
conducive	OO
for	OO
ambushing	.O
meaning	,U
a	OO
man	OO
on	OO
the	OO
side	OO
of	OO
the	OO
road	OO
wasn't	OO
abnormal	.O
wasn't	OU
strange	.O
and	OU
in	OO
fact	,O
it	OO
was	OO
something	OO
that	OO
was	OO
structured	OO
to	OO
happen	,O
it	OO
was	OO
supposed	OO
to	OO
happen	.O
and	OU
johan	OU
galtung	,U
a	OO
peace	OO
theorist	,O
talks	OO
about	OO
structural	OO
violence	OO
in	OO
our	OO
society	.O
he	OU
says	,O
structural	OU
violence	OO
is	OO
the	OO
avoidable	OO
impairment	OO
of	OO
basic	OO
human	OO
needs	.O
dr	.U
paul	OU
farmer	OU
talks	OO
about	OO
structural	OO
violence	OO
and	OO
talks	OO
about	OO
how	OO
it's	OO
the	OO
way	OO
our	OO
institutions	,O
our	OO
policies	,O
our	OO
culture	OO
creates	OO
outcomes	OO
that	OO
advantage	OO
some	OO
people	OO
and	OO
disadvantage	OO
others	.O
and	OU
then	OO
i	OU
realized	,O
much	OO
like	OO
the	OO
road	OO
in	OO
jericho	,U
in	OO
many	OO
ways	,O
stockton	,U
our	OO
society	,O
has	OO
been	OO
structured	OO
for	OO
the	OO
outcomes	OO
we	OO
complain	OO
about	.O
that	OU
we	OO
should	OO
not	OO
be	OO
surprised	OO
when	OO
we	OO
see	OO
that	OO
kids	OO
in	OO
poverty	OO
don't	OO
do	OO
well	OO
in	OO
school	,O
that	OO
we	OO
should	OO
not	OO
be	OO
surprised	OO
to	OO
see	OO
wealth	OO
gaps	OO
by	OO
race	OO
and	OO
ethnicity	.O
we	OU
should	OO
not	OO
be	OO
surprised	OO
to	OO
see	OO
income	OO
pay	OO
disparities	OO
between	OO
genders	,O
because	OO
that's	OO
what	OO
our	OO
society	,O
historically	,O
has	OO
been	OO
structured	OO
to	OO
do	,O
and	OO
it's	OO
working	OO
accordingly	.O
so	OU
taking	OO
this	OO
wisdom	,O
i	OU
rolled	OO
up	OO
my	OO
sleeves	OO
and	OO
began	OO
to	OO
work	.O
and	OU
there's	OO
three	OO
quick	OO
stories	OO
i	OU
want	OO
to	OO
share	,O
that	OO
point	OO
to	OO
not	OO
that	OO
we	OO
figured	OO
everything	OO
out	,O
not	OO
that	OO
we	OO
have	OO
arrived	,O
but	OO
we're	OO
trending	OO
in	OO
the	OO
right	OO
direction	.O
the	OU
first	OO
story	,O
about	OO
the	OO
neighbor	.O
when	OU
i	OU
was	OO
a	OO
city	OO
council	OO
member	,O
i	OU
was	OO
working	OO
with	OO
one	OO
of	OO
the	OO
most	OO
conservative	OO
members	OO
in	OO
our	OO
community	OO
on	OO
opening	OO
a	OO
health	OO
clinic	OO
for	OO
undocumented	OO
people	OO
in	OO
the	OO
south	OO
part	OO
of	OO
the	OO
city	,O
and	OO
i	OU
loved	OO
it	.O
and	OU
as	OO
we	OO
opened	OO
the	OO
clinic	,O
we	OO
had	OO
a	OO
resolution	OO
to	OO
sign	,O
he	OO
presented	OO
me	OO
a	OO
gift	.O
it	OU
was	OO
an	OO
o'reilly	OU
factor	OU
lifetime	OO
membership	OO
pin	.O
mind	OU
you	,O
i	OU
didn't	OO
ask	OO
what	OO
he	OO
did	OO
to	OO
get	OO
such	OO
a	OO
gift	.O
what	OU
blood	OO
oath	OO
—	OO
i	OU
had	OO
no	OO
idea	OO
how	OO
he	OO
got	OO
it	.O
but	OU
i	OU
looked	OO
at	OO
him	OO
and	OO
i	OU
said	,O
well	,U
how	OO
are	OO
we	OO
working	OO
together	OO
to	OO
open	OO
a	OO
health	OO
clinic	,O
to	OO
provide	OO
free	OO
health	OO
care	OO
for	OO
undocumented	OO
people	,O
and	OO
you're	OO
an	OO
o'reilly	OU
factor	OU
member	?O
he	OU
looked	OO
at	OO
me	OO
and	OO
said	,O
councilman	OU
tubbs	,U
this	OO
is	OO
for	OO
my	OO
neighbors	.O
and	OU
he's	OO
a	OO
great	OO
example	OO
of	OO
what	OO
it	OO
means	OO
to	OO
be	OO
a	OO
good	OO
neighbor	,O
at	OO
least	OO
in	OO
that	OO
instance	.O
the	OU
robbers	.O
so	OU
after	OO
four	OO
years	OO
on	OO
city	OO
council	,O
i	OU
decided	OO
to	OO
run	OO
for	OO
mayor	,O
realizing	OO
that	OO
being	OO
a	OO
part	OO
time	OO
councilman	OO
wasn't	OO
enough	OO
to	OO
enact	OO
the	OO
structural	OO
changes	OO
we	OO
need	OO
to	OO
see	OO
in	OO
stockton	,U
and	OO
i	OU
came	OO
to	OO
that	OO
conclusion	OO
by	OO
looking	OO
at	OO
the	OO
data	.O
so	OU
my	OO
old	OO
council	OO
district	,O
where	OO
i	OU
grew	OO
up	,O
is	OO
10	OO
minutes	OO
away	OO
from	OO
a	OO
more	OO
affluent	OO
district	.O
and	OU
10	OO
minutes	OO
away	OO
in	OO
the	OO
same	OO
city	,O
the	OO
difference	OO
between	OO
zip	OO
code	OO
95205	OO
and	OO
95219	OO
in	OO
life	OO
expectancy	OO
is	OO
10	OO
years	.O
ten	OU
minutes	OO
away	,O
4.5	OO
miles	,O
10	OO
years	OO
life	OO
expectancy	OO
difference	,O
and	OO
not	OO
because	OO
of	OO
the	OO
choices	OO
people	OO
are	OO
making	.O
because	OU
no	OO
one	OO
chose	OO
to	OO
live	OO
in	OO
an	OO
unsafe	OO
community	OO
where	OO
they	OO
can't	OO
exercise	.O
no	OU
one	OO
chose	OO
to	OO
put	OO
more	OO
liquor	OO
stores	OO
than	OO
grocery	OO
stores	OO
in	OO
the	OO
community	.O
no	OU
one	OO
chose	OO
these	OO
things	,O
but	OO
that's	OO
the	OO
reality	.O
i	OU
realized	,O
as	OO
a	OO
councilman	,O
to	OO
enact	OO
a	OO
structural	OO
change	OO
i	OU
wanted	OO
to	OO
see	,O
where	OO
between	OO
the	OO
same	OO
zip	OO
codes	OO
there's	OO
a	OO
30	OO
percent	OO
difference	OO
in	OO
the	OO
rate	OO
of	OO
unemployment	,O
there's	OO
a	OO
75,000	OO
dollars	OO
a	OO
year	OO
difference	OO
in	OO
income	,O
that	OO
being	OO
a	OO
councilman	OO
was	OO
not	OO
going	OO
to	OO
cut	OO
it	.O
so	OU
that's	OO
when	OO
i	OU
decided	OO
to	OO
run	OO
for	OO
mayor	.O
and	OU
as	OO
mayor	,O
we've	OO
been	OO
focused	OO
on	OO
the	OO
robbers	OO
and	OO
the	OO
road	.O
so	OU
in	OO
stockton	,U
as	OO
i	OU
mentioned	,O
we	OO
have	OO
historically	OO
had	OO
problems	OO
with	OO
violent	OO
crime	.O
in	OU
fact	,O
that's	OO
why	OO
i	OU
decided	OO
to	OO
run	OO
for	OO
office	OO
in	OO
the	OO
first	OO
place	.O
and	OU
my	OO
first	OO
job	OO
as	OO
mayor	OO
was	OO
helping	OO
our	OO
community	OO
to	OO
see	OO
ourselves	,O
our	OO
neighbors	,O
not	OO
just	OO
in	OO
the	OO
people	OO
victimized	OO
by	OO
violence	OO
but	OO
also	OO
in	OO
the	OO
perpetrators	.O
we	OU
realized	OO
that	OO
those	OO
who	OO
enact	OO
pain	OO
in	OO
our	OO
society	,O
those	OO
who	OO
are	OO
committing	OO
homicides	OO
and	OO
contributing	OO
to	OO
gun	OO
violence	,O
are	OO
oftentimes	OO
victims	OO
themselves	.O
they	OU
have	OO
high	OO
rates	OO
of	OO
trauma	,O
they	OO
have	OO
been	OO
shot	OO
at	,O
they've	OO
known	OO
people	OO
who	OO
have	OO
been	OO
shot	.O
that	OU
doesn't	OO
excuse	OO
their	OO
behavior	,O
but	OO
it	OO
helps	OO
explain	OO
it	,O
and	OO
as	OO
a	OO
community	,O
we	OO
have	OO
to	OO
see	OO
these	OO
folks	OO
as	OO
us	,O
too	.O
that	OU
they	OO
too	OO
are	OO
our	OO
neighbors	.O
so	OU
for	OO
the	OO
past	OO
three	OO
years	OO
—	OO
so	OU
for	OO
the	OO
past	OO
three	OO
years	,O
we've	OO
been	OO
working	OO
on	OO
two	OO
strategies:	OO
ceasefire	OU
and	OO
advance	OU
peace	,U
where	OO
we	OO
give	OO
these	OO
guys	OO
as	OO
much	OO
attention	,O
as	OO
much	OO
love	OO
from	OO
social	OO
services	,O
from	OO
opportunities	,O
from	OO
tattoo	OO
removals	,O
in	OO
some	OO
cases	OO
even	OO
cash	,O
as	OO
a	OO
gift	OO
from	OO
law	OO
enforcement	.O
and	OU
last	OO
year	,O
we	OO
saw	OO
a	OO
40	OO
percent	OO
reduction	OO
in	OO
homicides	OO
and	OO
a	OO
30	OO
percent	OO
reduction	OO
in	OO
violent	OO
crime	.O
and	OU
now	,O
the	OO
road	.O
i	OU
mentioned	OO
that	OO
my	OO
community	OO
has	OO
a	OO
23	OO
percent	OO
poverty	OO
rate	.O
as	OU
someone	OO
who	OO
comes	OO
from	OO
poverty	,O
it's	OO
a	OO
personal	OO
issue	OO
for	OO
me	.O
so	OU
i	OU
decided	OO
that	OO
we	OO
wouldn't	OO
just	OO
do	OO
a	OO
program	,O
or	OO
we	OO
wouldn't	OO
just	OO
do	OO
something	OO
to	OO
go	OO
around	OO
the	OO
edges	,O
but	OO
we	OO
would	OO
call	OO
into	OO
question	OO
the	OO
very	OO
structure	OO
that	OO
produces	OO
poverty	OO
in	OO
the	OO
first	OO
place	.O
so	OU
starting	OO
in	OO
february	,U
we	OO
launched	OO
a	OO
basic	OO
income	OO
demonstration	,O
where	OO
for	OO
the	OO
next	OO
18	OO
months	,O
as	OO
a	OO
pilot	,O
130	OO
families	,O
randomly	OO
selected	,O
who	OO
live	OO
in	OO
zip	OO
codes	OO
at	OO
or	OO
below	OO
the	OO
median	OO
income	OO
of	OO
the	OO
city	,O
are	OO
given	OO
500	OO
dollars	OO
a	OO
month	.O
and	OU
we're	OO
doing	OO
this	OO
for	OO
a	OO
couple	OO
of	OO
reasons	.O
we're	OU
doing	OO
it	OO
because	OO
we	OO
realize	OO
that	OO
something	OO
is	OO
structurally	OO
wrong	OO
in	OO
america	,U
when	OO
one	OO
in	OO
two	OO
americans	OU
can't	OO
afford	OO
one	OO
400	OO
dollar	OO
emergency	.O
we're	OU
doing	OO
it	OO
because	OO
we	OO
realize	OO
that	OO
something	OO
is	OO
structurally	OO
wrong	OO
when	OO
wages	OO
have	OO
only	OO
increased	OO
six	OO
percent	OO
between	OO
1979	OO
and	OO
2013	.O
we're	OU
doing	OO
it	OO
because	OO
we	OO
realize	OO
something	OO
is	OO
structurally	OO
wrong	OO
when	OO
people	OO
working	OO
two	OO
and	OO
three	OO
jobs	,O
doing	OO
all	OO
the	OO
jobs	OO
no	OO
one	OO
in	OO
here	OO
wants	OO
to	OO
do	,O
can't	OO
pay	OO
for	OO
necessities	,O
like	OO
rent	,O
like	OO
lights	,O
like	OO
health	OO
care	,O
like	OO
childcare	.O
so	OU
i	OU
would	OO
say	,O
stockton	OU
again	,O
we	OO
have	OO
real	OO
issues	.O
i	OU
have	OO
constituent	OO
emails	OO
in	OO
my	OO
phone	OO
now	,O
about	OO
the	OO
homelessness	OO
issue	,O
about	OO
some	OO
of	OO
the	OO
violent	OO
crime	OO
we're	OO
still	OO
experiencing	.O
but	OU
i	OU
would	OO
say	,O
i	OU
think	OO
as	OO
a	OO
society	,O
we	OO
would	OO
be	OO
wise	OO
to	OO
go	OO
back	OO
to	OO
those	OO
old	OO
bible	OU
stories	OO
we	OO
were	OO
taught	OO
growing	OO
up	,O
and	OO
understand	OO
that	OO
number	OO
one	,O
we	OO
have	OO
to	OO
begin	OO
to	OO
see	OO
each	OO
other	OO
as	OO
neighbors	,O
that	OO
when	OO
we	OO
see	OO
someone	OO
different	OO
from	OO
us	,O
they	OO
should	OO
not	OO
reflect	OO
our	OO
fears	,O
our	OO
anxieties	,O
our	OO
insecurities	,O
the	OO
prejudices	OO
we've	OO
been	OO
taught	,O
our	OO
biases	OO
—	OO
but	OO
we	OO
should	OO
see	OO
ourselves	.O
we	OU
should	OO
see	OO
our	OO
common	OO
humanity	.O
because	OU
i	OU
think	OO
once	OO
we	OO
do	OO
that	,O
we	OO
can	OO
do	OO
the	OO
more	OO
important	OO
work	OO
of	OO
restructuring	OO
the	OO
road	.O
because	OU
again	,O
i	OU
understand	OO
some	OO
listening	OO
are	OO
saying	,O
well	,U
mayor	OU
tubbs	,U
you're	OO
talking	OO
about	OO
structural	OO
violence	OO
and	OO
structural	OO
this	,O
but	OO
you're	OO
on	OO
the	OO
stage	.O
that	OU
the	OO
structures	OO
can't	OO
be	OO
too	OO
bad	OO
if	OO
you	OO
could	OO
come	OO
up	OO
from	OO
poverty	,O
have	OO
a	OO
father	OO
in	OO
jail	,O
go	OO
to	OO
stanford	,U
work	OO
in	OO
the	OO
white	OU
house	OU
and	OO
become	OO
mayor	.O
and	OU
i	OU
would	OO
respond	OO
by	OO
saying	OO
the	OO
term	OO
for	OO
that	OO
is	OO
exceptionalism	.O
meaning	OU
that	OO
we	OO
recognize	OO
it's	OO
exceptional	OO
for	OO
people	OO
to	OO
escape	OO
the	OO
structures	.O
meaning	OU
by	OO
our	OO
very	OO
language	,O
we	OO
understand	OO
that	OO
the	OO
things	OO
we're	OO
seeing	OO
in	OO
our	OO
world	OO
are	OO
by	OO
design	.O
and	OU
i	OU
think	OO
that	OO
task	OO
for	OO
us	,O
as	OO
tedsters	,U
and	OO
as	OO
good	OO
people	,O
just	OO
people	,O
moral	OO
people	,O
is	OO
really	OO
do	OO
the	OO
hard	OO
work	OO
necessary	OO
of	OO
not	OO
just	OO
joining	OO
hands	OO
as	OO
neighbors	,O
but	OO
using	OO
our	OO
hands	OO
to	OO
restructure	OO
our	OO
road	,O
a	OO
road	OO
that	OO
in	OO
this	OO
country	OO
has	OO
been	OO
rooted	OO
in	OO
things	OO
like	OO

a	OU
road	OO
like	OO
in	OO
this	OO
country	OO
has	OO
been	OO
rooted	OO
in	OO
things	OO
like	OO
misogyny	.O
a	OU
road	OO
that's	OO
not	OO
working	OO
for	OO
far	OO
too	OO
many	OO
people	.O
and	OU
i	OU
think	OO
today	,O
tomorrow	OO
and	OO
2020	OO
we	OO
have	OO
a	OO
chance	OO
to	OO
change	OO
that	.O
so	OU
as	OO
i	OU
prepare	OO
to	OO
close	,O
i	OU
started	OO
with	OO
a	OO
story	OO
from	OO
nine	OO
years	OO

and	OO
i'll	OU
end	OO
with	OO
one	.O
so	OU
after	OO
my	OO
cousin	OO
was	OO
murdered	,O
i	OU
was	OO
lucky	OO
enough	OO
to	OO
go	OO
on	OO
the	OO
freedom	OU
rides	OU
with	OO
some	OO
of	OO
the	OO
original	OO
freedom	OO
riders	.O
and	OU
they	OO
taught	OO
me	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
about	OO
restructuring	OO
the	OO
road	.O
and	OU
one	OO
guy	OO
in	OO
particular	,O
bob	OU
singleton	,U
asked	OO
me	OO
a	OO
question	OO
i'm	OU
going	OO
to	OO
leave	OO
with	OO
us	OO
today	.O
we	OU
were	OO
going	OO
to	OO
anniston	,U
alabama	,U
and	OO
he	OO
said	,O
michael	,U
and	OO
i	OU
said	,O
yes	,U
sir	.O
he	OU
said	,O
i	OU
was	OO
arrested	OO
on	OO
august	OU
4	,O
1961	.O
now	OU
why	OO
is	OO
that	OO
day	OO
important	?O
and	OU
i	OU
said	,O
well	,U
you	OO
were	OO
arrested	,O
if	OO
you	OO
weren't	OO
arrested	,O
we	OO
wouldn't	OO
be	OO
on	OO
this	OO
bus	.O
if	OO
we	OO
weren't	OO
on	OO
this	OO
bus	,O
we	OO
wouldn't	OO
have	OO
the	OO
rights	OO
we	OO
enjoy	.O
he	OU
rolled	OO
his	OO
eyes	OO
and	OO
said	,O
no	,U
son	.O
he	OU
said	,O
on	OU
that	OO
day	,O
barack	OU
obama	OU
was	OO
born	.O
and	OU
then	OO
he	OO
said	OO
he	OO
had	OO
no	OO
idea	OO
that	OO
the	OO
choice	OO
he	OO
made	OO
to	OO
restructure	OO
the	OO
road	OO
would	OO
pave	OO
the	OO
way	,O
so	OO
a	OO
child	OO
born	OO
as	OO
a	OO
second	OO
class	OO
citizen	,O
who	OO
wouldn't	OO
be	OO
able	OO
to	OO
even	OO
get	OO
a	OO
cup	OO
of	OO
water	OO
at	OO
a	OO
counter	,O
would	OO
have	OO
the	OO
chance	,O
50	OO
years	OO
later	,O
to	OO
be	OO
president	.O
then	OU
he	OO
looked	OO
at	OO
me	OO
and	OO
he	OO
said	,O
what	OU
are	OO
you	OO
prepared	OO
to	OO
do	OO
today	OO
so	OO
that	OO
50	OO
years	OO
from	OO
now	OO
a	OO
child	OO
born	OO
has	OO
a	OO
chance	OO
to	OO
be	OO
president	?O
and	OU
i	OU
think	,O
ted	,U
that's	OO
the	OO
question	OO
before	OO
us	OO
today	.O
we	OU
know	OO
things	OO
are	OO
jacked	OO
up	.O
i	OU
think	OO
what	OO
we've	OO
seen	OO
recently	OO
isn't	OO
abnormal	OO
but	OO
a	OO
reflection	OO
of	OO
a	OO
system	OO
that's	OO
been	OO
structured	OO
to	OO
produce	OO
such	OO
crazy	OO
outcomes	.O
but	OU
i	OU
think	OO
it's	OO
also	OO
an	OO
opportunity	.O
because	OU
these	OO
structures	OO
we	OO
inherit	OO
aren't	OO
acts	OO
of	OO
god	OU
but	OO
acts	OO
of	OO
men	OO
and	OO
women	,O
they're	OO
policy	OO
choices	,O
they're	OO
by	OO
politicians	OO
like	OO
me	,O
approved	OO
by	OO
voters	OO
like	OO
you	.O
and	OU
we	OO
have	OO
the	OO
chance	OO
and	OO
the	OO
awesome	OO
opportunity	OO
to	OO
do	OO
something	OO
about	OO
it	.O
so	OU
my	OO
question	OO
is:	OO
what	OU
are	OO
we	OO
prepared	OO
to	OO
do	OO
today	,O
so	OO
that	OO
a	OO
child	OO
born	OO
today	,O
50	OO
years	OO
from	OO
now	OO
isn't	OO
born	OO
in	OO
a	OO
society	OO
rooted	OO
in	OO
white	OO
supremacy;	OO
isn't	OO
born	OO
into	OO
a	OO
society	OO
riddled	OO
with	OO
misogyny;	OO
isn't	OO
born	OO
into	OO
a	OO
society	OO
riddled	OO
with	OO
homophobia	OO
and	OO
transphobia	OO
and	OO
anti	OO
semitism	OU
and	OO
islamophobia	OU
and	OO
ableism	,O
and	OO
all	OO
the	OO
phobias	OO
and	OO
isms	?O
what	OU
are	OO
we	OO
prepared	OO
to	OO
do	OO
today	,O
so	OO
that	OO
50	OO
years	OO
from	OO
now	OO
we	OO
have	OO
a	OO
road	OO
in	OO
our	OO
society	OO
that's	OO
structured	OO
to	OO
reflect	OO
what	OO
we	OO
hold	OO
to	OO
be	OO
self	OO
evident	?O
that	OU
all	OO
men	,O
that	OO
all	OO

that	OO
even	OO
all	OO

me	OO

you	OO
the	OO
example	OO
of	OO
the	OO
perilous	OO
life	OO
cycle	OO
of	OO
a	OO
coral	OO

fish	.O
so	OU
we're	OO
all	OO
familiar	OO
with	OO
the	OO

fish	OO
that	OO
live	OO
on	OO

cities	OO
of	OO
life	OO
full	OO
of	OO

but	OU
each	OO

these	OO
fish	OO
produce	OO
eggs	,O
and	OO
the	OO
eggs	OO
hatch	OO
into	OO
tiny	,O
almost	OO
microscopic	OO
larvae	,O
and	OO
they	OO
spend	OO
several	OO
weeks	OO
at	OO

developing	,O
only	OO
the	OO

of	OO
a	OO

of	OO

after	OO
about	OO

they're	OO

to	OO
a	OO
coral	OO

where	OO
hopefully	,O
once	OO
they	OO

the	OO

they	OO
can	OO

now	,U
this	OO
seems	OO
paradoxical:	OO
you	OO
live	OO
in	OO
the	OO

and	OO
yet	OO
you	OO
send	OO
your	OO

why	OU
would	OO
that	OO
be	OO
so	?O
i've	OU
spent	OO
my	OO

trying	OO
to	OO

some	OO
of	OO
the	OO

that	OO

you're	OU

if	OO
you're	OO
the	OO

you	OO

how	OO

you	OO

it	?O
if	OU

what	OO
what	OO

you	OO

to	OO

well	,U
we	OO
know	OO
that	OO
some	OO
fish	OO
are	OO
able	OO
to	OO
smell	OO
different	OO
components	OO
of	OO
their	OO

some	OU

are	OO
able	OO
to	OO
look	OO
at	OO
the	OO

of	OO
the	OO
sun	OO
in	OO
the	OO

even	OO
the	OO
way	OO
sunlight	OO

through	OO
the	OO

perhaps	OO
even	OO
use	OO
celestial	OO
nighttime	OO
visual	OO
cues	.O
some	OU
fish	OO
even	OO
have	OO
a	OO

so	OU
is	OO
that	OO
enough	OO
information	OO
to	OO

these	OO

well	OU
certainly	,O
one	OO
thing	OO
that	OO
they	OO
probably	OO

use	OO
is	OO
sound	,O
right	?O
60	OO
years	OO
ago	,O
jacques	OU
cousteau	OU
brought	OO
into	OO
the	OO
living	OO
rooms	OO
of	OO
the	OO
world	,O
for	OO
the	OO
first	OO
time	,O
the	OO
wonder	OO
of	OO
our	OO
underwater	OO
world	.O
he	OU
invented	OO
scuba	,O
to	OO
be	OO
able	OO
to	OO
take	OO
cameras	OO
underwater	OO
and	OO
beam	OO
those	OO
images	OO
back	OO
to	OO
people	OO
around	OO
the	OO
world	.O
it	OU
was	OO
a	OO
remarkable	OO
film	OO
in	OO
so	OO
many	OO
ways	,O
except	OO
perhaps	OO
for	OO
the	OO
title	.O
you	OU
see	,O
jacques	OU
cousteau	OU
told	OO
us	OO
that	OO
the	OO
ocean	OO
was	OO
a	OO
silent	OO
world	.O
but	OU
when	OO
we	OO
go	OO
into	OO
the	OO
ocean	,O
we	OO
know	OO
that's	OO
not	OO
true	.O
without	OU
scuba	,O
we	OO
hear	OO
whales	OO
singing	.O
this	OU
is	OO
the	OO
love	OO
song	OO
of	OO
a	OO
humpback	OO
whale	.O
and	OU
whales	OO
can	OO
communicate	OO
over	OO
tens	OO
of	OO
miles	,O
sometimes	OO
hundreds	OO
of	OO
miles	,O
as	OO
they	OO
interact	OO
with	OO
each	OO
other	.O
when	OU
we	OO
look	OO
on	OO
a	OO
coral	OO
reef	,O
we	OO
realize	OO
it's	OO
not	OO
just	OO
whales	OO
and	OO
dolphins	OO
making	OO
sound;	OO
the	OO
fish	OO
can	OO
speak	OO
too	.O
fish	OU
produce	OO
popping	,O
grunting	,O
whooping	,O
trumpeting	OO
sounds	,O
and	OO
they	OO
do	OO
this	OO
to	OO
warn	OO
each	OO
other	OO
of	OO
predators	,O
to	OO
be	OO
able	OO
to	OO
call	OO
each	OO
other	OO
over	OO
when	OO
they	OO
find	OO
food	,O
and	OO
sometimes	,O
particularly	OO
around	OO
the	OO
breeding	OO
season	,O
to	OO
try	OO
and	OO
really	OO
impress	OO
each	OO
other	.O
and	OU
so	OO
they	OO
have	OO
some	OO
amazing	OO
songs	OO
within	OO
the	OO
world	OO
of	OO
fish	.O
here's	OU
some	OO
of	OO
the	OO
croaking	OO
sounds	OO
of	OO
sergeant	OO
majors	,O
the	OO
whooping	OO
sound	OO
of	OO
an	OO
ambo	OO
damselfish	OO
and	OO
the	OO
deep	OO
grunting	OO
love	OO
song	,O
in	OO
this	OO
case	OO
of	OO
a	OO
cod	.O
so	OU
fish	OO
use	OO
sound;	OO
it's	OO
essential	OO
to	OO
their	OO
lives	.O
and	OU
it's	OO
not	OO
even	OO
just	OO
the	OO
fish	.O
when	OU
we	OO
start	OO
looking	OO
at	OO
the	OO
invertebrates	OO
that	OO
live	OO
on	OO
the	OO
reef	OO
too	,O
we	OO
realize	OO
that	OO
lobsters	OO
can	OO
play	OO
their	OO
antennae	OO
like	OO
a	OO
fiddler	OO
would	OO
play	OO
the	OO
violin	,O
and	OO
snapping	OO
shrimp	,O
that	OO
probably	OO
are	OO
no	OO
bigger	OO
than	OO
the	OO
size	OO
of	OO
your	OO
thumb	,O
with	OO
a	OO
claw	OO
no	OO
bigger	OO
than	OO
the	OO
size	OO
of	OO
your	OO
thumbnail	,O
are	OO
able	OO
to	OO
produce	OO
one	OO
of	OO
the	OO
loudest	OO
underwater	OO
explosions	OO
every	OO
time	OO
they	OO
open	OO
their	OO
claw	OO
and	OO
push	OO
a	OO
bubble	OO
forwards	OO
into	OO
the	OO
water	OO
which	OO
implodes	OO
with	OO
a	OO
flash	OO
of	OO
light	OO
and	OO
an	OO
enormous	OO
bang	.O
and	OU
all	OO
together	,O
that	OO
creates	OO
a	OO
crackling	OO
sound	OO
that	OO
gives	OO
coral	OO
reefs	OO
its	OO
soundscape	.O
so	OU
18	OO
years	OO
ago	,O
i	OU
asked	OO
a	OO
question	OO
which	,O
at	OO
the	OO
time	,O
almost	OO
everybody	OO
i	OU
was	OO
working	OO
with	OO
on	OO
the	OO
great	OU
barrier	OU
reef	OU
thought	OO
was	OO
crazy:	OO
is	OO
it	OO
possible	OO
that	OO
fish	OO
could	OO
use	OO
sound	OO
as	OO
a	OO
way	OO
of	OO
finding	OO
their	OO
way	OO
home	?O
now	,U
to	OO
ask	OO
that	OO
question	,O
my	OO
first	OO
approach	OO
was	OO
to	OO
take	OO
light	OO
traps	OO
light	OO
traps	OO
are	OO
bright	OO
boxes	OO
with	OO
clear	OO
glass	OO
windows	OO
which	OO
have	OO
slits	OO
in	OO
them	,O
like	OO
letter	OO
boxes	OO
and	OO
when	OO
you	OO
shine	OO
a	OO
bright	OO
light	OO
underwater	OO
on	OO
the	OO
edge	OO
of	OO
the	OO
reef	,O
you	OO
can	OO
intercept	OO
the	OO
larval	OO
fish	,O
the	OO
baby	OO
fish	,O
as	OO
they	OO
come	OO
back	OO
to	OO
the	OO
reef	.O
many	OU
fish	,O
like	OO
moths	,O
are	OO
attracted	OO
to	OO
light	,O
and	OO
we	OO
can	OO
catch	OO
them	OO
in	OO
our	OO
traps	OO
and	OO
we	OO
can	OO
count	OO
them	OO
as	OO
they	OO
return	.O
but	OU
just	OO
to	OO
mix	OO
it	OO
up	OO
a	OO
little	OO
bit	,O
i	OU
then	OO
hung	OO
underneath	OO
a	OO
trap	OO
a	OO
speaker	.O
these	OU
are	OO
underwater	OO
speakers	OO
sold	OO
for	OO
synchronized	OO
swimming	OO
teams	OO
to	OO
be	OO
able	OO
to	OO
keep	OO
beat	OO
underwater	,O
but	OO
we	OO
use	OO
these	OO
speakers	OO
to	OO
playback	OO
recordings	OO
of	OO
coral	OO
reefs	,O
to	OO
ask	OO
the	OO
question	,O
are	OU
fish	,O
at	OO
this	OO
tiny	OO
early	OO
stage	OO
in	OO
their	OO
life	,O
several	OO
weeks	OO
old	,O
attracted	OO
to	OO
coral	OO
reef	OO
sound	?O
and	OU
sure	OO
enough	,O
three	OO
months	OO
later	,O
putting	OO
these	OO
traps	OO
out	OO
night	OO
after	OO
night	,O
we	OO
found	OO
that	OO
we	OO
caught	OO
more	OO
than	OO
twice	OO
as	OO
many	OO
fish	OO
in	OO
our	OO
noisy	OO
traps	OO
compared	OO
to	OO
the	OO
quiet	OO
ones	.O
and	OU
then	,O
to	OO
test	OO
whether	OO
this	OO
really	OO
was	OO
enough	OO
for	OO
a	OO
fish	OO
to	OO
choose	OO
where	OO
it	OO
wanted	OO
to	OO
make	OO
its	OO
home	,O
we	OO
hung	OO
the	OO
speakers	OO
over	OO
small	OO
piles	OO
of	OO
dead	OO
coral	OO
rubble	,O
artificial	OO
reefs	OO
that	OO
we	OO
built	OO
on	OO
the	OO
sand	OO
flats	.O
and	OU
sure	OO
enough	,O
the	OO
fish	OO
came	OO
swimming	OO
in	OO
when	OO
we	OO
were	OO
playing	OO
our	OO
sound	.O
so	OU
sound	OO
is	OO
clearly	OO
a	OO
cue	OO
that	OO
these	OO
fish	OO
were	OO
using	OO
to	OO
hear	OO
their	OO
way	OO
home	.O
so	OU
i've	OU
spent	OO
the	OO
last	OO
15	OO
years	OO
listening	OO
to	OO
the	OO
ocean	,O
trying	OO
to	OO
interpret	OO
what	OO
these	OO
fish	OO
can	OO
hear	.O
what	OU
is	OO
it	,O
what	OO
information	OO
is	OO
available	OO
that	OO
gives	OO
fish	OO
this	OO
sensory	OO
experience	OO
that	OO
encourages	OO
them	OO
home	?O
now	,U
as	OO
a	OO
marine	OO
biologist	,O
one	OO
of	OO
the	OO
privileges	OO
is	OO
getting	OO
to	OO
play	OO
with	OO
some	OO
very	OO
big	,O
very	OO
expensive	OO
toys	.O
and	OU
i'm	OU
just	OO
going	OO
to	OO
share	OO
two	OO
of	OO
mine	OO
with	OO
you	OO
today	.O
the	OU
first	OO
is	OO
the	OO
good	OO
ship	OO
masifa	,U
which	OO
we	OO
invented	OO
as	OO
a	OO
way	OO
of	OO
being	OO
able	OO
to	OO
sail	OO
a	OO
hydrophone	,O
an	OO
underwater	OO
microphone	,O
over	OO
the	OO
reefs	OO
so	OO
that	OO
we	OO
could	OO
start	OO
to	OO
understand	OO
the	OO
rich	OO
tapestry	OO
of	OO
sound	OO
that's	OO
made	OO
as	OO
you	OO
travel	OO
from	OO
different	OO
types	OO
of	OO
reef	.O
and	OU
then	OO
the	OO
second	OO
one	OO
is	OO
my	OO
hydrosaur	.O
this	OU
is	OO
a	OO
you	OO
could	OO
see	OO
at	OO
the	OO
time	OO
that	OO
funding	OO
for	OO
marine	OO
bio	OO
acoustics	OO
was	OO
in	OO
its	OO
early	OO
stages	.O
this	OU
is	OO
an	OO
inflatable	OO
dinosaur	,O
but	OO
i	OU
was	OO
able	OO
to	OO
strap	OO
my	OO
microphone	OO
to	OO
this	OO
and	OO
leave	OO
it	OO
out	OO
overnight	,O
and	OO
by	OO
doing	OO
that	,O
we	OO
started	OO
to	OO
realize	OO
there	OO
were	OO
patterns	OO
in	OO
the	OO
soundscape	.O
at	OU
dusk	,O
all	OO
of	OO
the	OO
nocturnal	OO
fish	,O
the	OO
predators	,O
emerge	OO
from	OO
their	OO
caves	,O
and	OO
they	OO
start	OO
calling	OO
to	OO
each	OO
other	OO
as	OO
they	OO
go	OO
looking	OO
for	OO
food	.O
so	OU
we	OO
get	OO
a	OO
dusk	OO
chorus	.O
and	OU
then	OO
at	OO
dawn	,O
these	OO
fish	OO
disappear	OO
back	OO
into	OO
the	OO
reef	OO
but	OO
out	OO
come	OO
all	OO
the	OO
daytime	OO
fish	,O
and	OO
they've	OO
got	OO
to	OO
reestablish	OO
their	OO
territories	,O
much	OO
like	OO
birds	OO
would	OO
do	OO
in	OO
a	OO
forest	,O
and	OO
so	OO
we	OO
get	OO
a	OO
dawn	OO
chorus	OO
too	.O
the	OU
reef	OO
is	OO
alive	OO
with	OO
noise	,O
and	OO
that	OO
noise	OO
has	OO
patterns	.O
and	OU
we've	OO
explored	OO
this	OO
by	OO
combining	OO
recordings	OO
with	OO
underwater	OO
surveys	.O
and	OU
with	OO
our	OO
underwater	OO
surveys	,O
we	OO
realize	OO
that	OO
we	OO
can	OO
hear	OO
whether	OO
there	OO
are	OO
coral	OO
there	.O
we	OU
can	OO
hear	OO
which	OO
species	OO
live	OO
there	.O
we	OU
realize	OO
that	OO
the	OO
fish	OO
at	OO
sea	OO
are	OO
doing	OO
much	OO
what	OO
we	OO
would	OO
do	OO
if	OO
we	OO
were	OO
moving	OO
to	OO
a	OO
new	OO
city:	OO
we'd	OO
perhaps	OO
get	OO
on	OO
the	OO
internet	OO
and	OO
do	OO
some	OO
research	OO
into	OO
different	OO
suburbs	OO
that	OO
we	OO
might	OO
want	OO
to	OO
live	OO
in	.O
we	OU
think	OO
fish	OO
can	OO
do	OO
the	OO
same	OO
thing	OO
by	OO
listening	OO
to	OO
their	OO
environment	OO
and	OO
choosing	OO
where	OO
they	OO
want	OO
to	OO
live	.O
we	OU
now	OO
know	OO
that	OO
reefs	OO
all	OO
sound	OO
different;	OO
they	OO
have	OO
signature	OO
sounds	.O
baby	OU
fish	OO
can	OO
select	OO
the	OO
best	OO
habitat	OO
for	OO
their	OO
kind	OO
by	OO
using	OO
sound	.O
and	OU
amazingly	,O
it	OO
turns	OO
out	OO
so	OO
can	OO
many	OO
other	OO
animals	OO
on	OO
coral	OO
reefs:	OO
crabs	,O
lobsters	,O
clams	,O
oysters	,O
even	OO
corals	OO
themselves	.O
here's	OU
a	OO
few	OO

this	OU

it's	OO

it's	OU

there's	OO

a	OO

when	OO

it	,O
it's	OO
a	OO

you	OU

the	OO

you	OO

hear	OO
the	OO

now	OU
sadly	,O
if	OO
we	OO
go	OO
three	OO

around	OO
the	OO

we	OO
find	OO
a	OO
more	OO
typical	OO
filipino	OU

this	OU
is	OO
a	OO
reef	OO
that's	OO
been	OO
heavily	OO
overfished	,O
so	OO
there	OO
are	OO
no	OO
herbivores	OO
to	OO

you	OU

and	OO
when	OO

you	OO

just	OO

it	.O
so	OU
a	OO

this	OU

for	OO

this	OU

you	OU

it's	OO
a	OO

at	OU

until	OO

we	OO

when	OO

we	OO

which	OO

we've	OO

that	OO

all	OO

that	OO

it	.O
and	OU
with	OO

the	OO

this	OU

a	OO

that	OO

the	OO

of	OO
the	OO

now	,U
if	OO
this	OO
was	OO
the	OO
end	OO
of	OO
the	OO

it	OO
would	OO
be	OO
a	OO
sorry	OO

but	OO
as	OO
a	OO
scientist	,O
i	OU
asked	OO
myself	,O
what	OU
is	OO
my	OO
role	?O
why	OU
am	OO
i	OU
trying	OO
to	OO
do	OO
the	OO
science	OO
that	OO
i'm	OU
doing	?O
is	OU
my	OO
duty	OO
simply	OO
to	OO
monitor	,O
to	OO
measure	,O
to	OO
assess	OO
how	OO
the	OO
world	OO
is	OO
changing	OO
and	OO
to	OO

that	?O
or	OU
can	OO
we	OO
take	OO
that	OO
knowledge	,O
and	OO
can	OO
we	OO
actually	OO
turn	OO
it	OO
into	OO
practical	OO
solutions	?O
so	OU
here's	OO
the	OO
spiny	OO
chromis	,O
wonderful	OO
fish	,O
lives	OO
on	OO
the	OO
great	OU
barrier	OU

in	OO
monogamous	OO

a	OO
male	OO

female	OO
living	OO
together	.O
they	OU
lay	OO
their	OO
eggs	OO
in	OO
the	OO

and	OO
their	OO
eggs	OO
hatch	,O
and	OO
unusually	,O
they	OO
bring	OO
their	OO
young	OO
through	OO
those	OO
first	OO
few	OO
weeks	OO
on	OO
the	OO

they	OO
protect	OO
them	,O
and	OO
you	OO
can	OO
see	OO
their	OO
baby	OO
fish	OO
out	OO
here	,O
the	OO
larvae	OO
of	OO
the	OO
spiny	OO

now	,U
if	OO
we	OO
monitor	OO
how	OO
well	OO
they	OO
do	OO
near	OO
to	OO
boating	OO
channels	,O
we	OO
realize	OO
that	OO
that	OO
motorboat	OO
noise	OO
means	OO
the	OO
adults	OO
don't	OO
feed	OO
as	OO
well	,O
they	OO
don't	OO
defend	OO
the	OO

against	OO

in	OO
the	OO

way	,O
and	OO
the	OO
larvae	OO
fail	OO
to	OO
develop	,O
less	OO

make	OO
it	OO
through	.O
so	,U
is	OO
that	OO
a	OO
real	OO

story	OO
of	OO
how	OO
with	OO

we're	OO

could	OO
it	OO
be	OO
that	OO
actually	,O
if	OO
we	OO
turn	OO
it	OO
on	OO
its	OO

we	OO
realize	OO
our	OO
comparison	OO
is	OO
what	OO
happens	OO
if	OO
the	OO

aren't	OO
there:	OO
we	OO
see	OO
more	OO

we	OO
see	OO
better	OO

in	OO
the	OO

more	OO

could	OU
we	OO
be	OO

here	OO
about	OO
a	OO

of	OO

if	OU
we	OO
go	OO
to	OO
the	OO

we	OO

the	OO

that	OO

when	OU

the	OU

second	,U
we're	OO
going	OO
far	OO
beyond	OO
nature's	OO

just	OO
20	OO

where	OO
they	OO

for	OU

fourth	,U
we're	OO
designing	OO
smart	OO
therapeutics	OO
that	OO
can	OO
do	OO

within	OO
the	OO

and	OO
go	OO
far	OO
beyond	OO
current	OO
medicines	,O
which	OO
are	OO
really	OO
blunt	OO
instruments	.O
for	OU

to	OO

a	OO

have	OO
stopped	OO
at	OO
4,200	.O
in	OU
fact	,O
with	OO
somebody	OO
this	OO
nihilistic	,O
he	OO
may	OO
well	OO
have	OO
gladly	OO
killed	OO
us	OO
all	.O
we	OU
don't	OO
know	.O
what	OU
we	OO
do	OO
know	OO
is	OO
this:	OO
when	OO
suicidal	OO
murderers	OO
really	OO
go	OO
all	OO
in	,O
technology	OO
is	OO
the	OO
force	OO
multiplier	.O
here's	OU
an	OO
example	.O
several	OU
years	OO
back	,O
there	OO
was	OO
a	OO
rash	OO
of	OO
10	OO
mass	OO
school	OO
attacks	OO
in	OO
china	OU
carried	OO
out	OO
with	OO
things	OO
like	OO
knives	OO
and	OO
hammers	OO
and	OO
cleavers	,O
because	OO
guns	OO
are	OO
really	OO
hard	OO
to	OO
get	OO
there	.O
by	OU
macabre	OO
coincidence	,O
this	OO
last	OO
attack	OO
occurred	OO
just	OO
hours	OO
before	OO
the	OO
massacre	OO
in	OO
newtown	,U
connecticut	.U
but	OU
that	OO
one	OO
american	OU
attack	OO
killed	OO
roughly	OO
the	OO
same	OO
number	OO
of	OO
victims	OO
as	OO
the	OO
10	OO
chinese	OU
attacks	OO
combined	.O
so	OU
we	OO
can	OO
fairly	OO
say	,O
knife:	OO
terrible;	OO
gun:	OO
way	OO
worse	.O
and	OU
airplane:	OO
massively	OO
worse	,O
as	OO
pilot	OO
andreas	OU
lubitz	OU
showed	OO
when	OO
he	OO
forced	OO
149	OO
people	OO
to	OO
join	OO
him	OO
in	OO
his	OO
suicide	,O
smashing	OO
a	OO
plane	OO
into	OO
the	OO
french	OU
alps	.U
and	OU
there	OO
are	OO
other	OO
examples	OO
of	OO
this	.O
and	OU
i'm	OU
afraid	OO
there	OO
are	OO
far	OO
more	OO
deadly	OO
weapons	OO
in	OO
our	OO
near	OO
future	OO
than	OO
airplanes	,O
ones	OO
not	OO
made	OO
of	OO
metal	.O
so	OU
let's	OO
consider	OO
the	OO
apocalyptic	OO
dynamics	OO
that	OO
will	OO
ensue	OO
if	OO
suicidal	OO
mass	OO
murder	OO
hitches	OO
a	OO
ride	OO
on	OO
a	OO
rapidly	OO
advancing	OO
field	OO
that	OO
for	OO
the	OO
most	OO
part	OO
holds	OO
boundless	OO
promise	OO
for	OO
society	.O
somewhere	OU
out	OO
there	OO
in	OO
the	OO
world	,O
there's	OO
a	OO
tiny	OO
group	OO
of	OO
people	OO
who	OO
would	OO
attempt	,O
however	OO
ineptly	,O
to	OO
kill	OO
us	OO
all	OO
if	OO
they	OO
could	OO
just	OO
figure	OO
out	OO
how	.O
the	OU
vegas	OU
shooter	OO
may	OO
or	OO
may	OO
not	OO
have	OO
been	OO
one	OO
of	OO
them	,O
but	OO
with	OO
seven	OO
and	OO
a	OO
half	OO
billion	OO
of	OO
us	,O
this	OO
is	OO
a	OO
nonzero	OO
population	.O
there's	OU
plenty	OO
of	OO
suicidal	OO
nihilists	OO
out	OO
there	.O
we've	OU
already	OO
seen	OO
that	.O
there's	OU
people	OO
with	OO
severe	OO
mood	OO

that	OO
they	OO
can't	OO
even	OO
control	.O
there	OU
are	OO
people	OO
who	OO
have	OO
just	OO
suffered	OO
deranging	OO

etc	.O
etc	.O
as	OU
for	OO
the	OO
corollary	OO
group	,O
its	OO
size	OO
was	OO
simply	OO
zero	OO
forever	OO
until	OO
the	OO
cold	OU
war	,U
when	OO
suddenly	,O
the	OO
leaders	OO
of	OO
two	OO
global	OO
alliances	OO
attained	OO
the	OO
ability	OO
to	OO
blow	OO
up	OO
the	OO
world	.O
the	OU
number	OO
of	OO
people	OO
with	OO
actual	OO
doomsday	OO
buttons	OO
has	OO
stayed	OO
fairly	OO
stable	OO
since	OO
then	.O
but	OU
i'm	OU
afraid	OO
it's	OO
about	OO
to	OO
grow	,O
and	OO
not	OO
just	OO
to	OO
three	.O
this	OU
is	OO
going	OO
off	OO
the	OO

i	OU
mean	,O
it's	OO
going	OO
to	OO
look	OO
like	OO
a	OO
tech	OO
business	OO
plan	.O
and	OU
the	OO
reason	OO
is	,O
we're	OO
in	OO
the	OO
era	OO
of	OO
exponential	OO
technologies	,O
which	OO
routinely	OO
take	OO
eternal	OO
impossibilities	OO
and	OO
make	OO
them	OO
the	OO
actual	OO
superpowers	OO
of	OO
one	OO
or	OO
two	OO
living	OO
geniuses	OO
and	OO
—	OO
this	OO
is	OO
the	OO
big	OO
part	OO
—	OO
then	OO
diffuse	OO
those	OO
powers	OO
to	OO
more	OO
or	OO
less	OO
everybody	.O
now	,U
here's	OO
a	OO
benign	OO
example	.O
if	OU
you	OO
wanted	OO
to	OO
play	OO
checkers	OO
with	OO
a	OO
computer	OO
in	OO
1952	,O
you	OO
literally	OO
had	OO
to	OO
be	OO
that	OO
guy	,O
then	OO
commandeer	OO
one	OO
of	OO
the	OO
world's	OO
19	OO
copies	OO
of	OO
that	OO
computer	,O
then	OO
used	OO
your	OO
nobel	OU
adjacent	OO
brain	OO
to	OO
teach	OO
it	OO
checkers	.O
that	OU
was	OO
the	OO
bar	.O
today	,U
you	OO
just	OO
need	OO
to	OO
know	OO
someone	OO
who	OO
knows	OO
someone	OO
who	OO
owns	OO
a	OO
telephone	,O
because	OO
computing	OO
is	OO
an	OO
exponential	OO
technology	.O
so	OU
is	OO
synthetic	OO
biology	,O
which	OO
i'll	OU
now	OO
refer	OO
to	OO
as	OO
synbio	.O
and	OU
in	OO
2011	,O
a	OO
couple	OO
of	OO
researchers	OO
did	OO
something	OO
every	OO
bit	OO
as	OO
ingenious	OO
and	OO
unprecedented	OO
as	OO
the	OO
checkers	OO
trick	OO
with	OO
h5n1	OU
flu	.O
this	OU
is	OO
a	OO
strain	OO
that	OO
kills	OO
up	OO
to	OO
60	OO
percent	OO
of	OO
the	OO
people	OO
it	OO
infects	,O
more	OO
than	OO
ebola	.U
but	OU
it	OO
is	OO
so	OO
uncontagious	OO
that	OO
it's	OO
killed	OO
fewer	OO
than	OO
50	OO
people	OO
since	OO
2015	.O
so	OU
these	OO
researchers	OO
edited	OO
h5n1's	OU
genome	OO
and	OO
made	OO
it	OO
every	OO
bit	OO
as	OO
deadly	,O
but	OO
also	OO
wildly	OO
contagious	.O
the	OU
news	OO
arm	OO
of	OO
one	OO
of	OO
the	OO
world's	OO
top	OO
two	OO
scientific	OO
journals	OO

if	OO
this	OO

out	,O
it	OO
would	OO

cause	OO
a	OO

with	OO

this	OO

and	OU
he's	OO

one	OO
of	OO
these	.O
now	,U
the	OO
good	OO
news	OO
about	OO
the	OO
2011	OO
biohack	OO
is	OO
that	OO
the	OO
people	OO
who	OO
did	OO
it	OO
didn't	OO
mean	OO
us	OO
any	OO
harm	.O
they're	OU
virologists	.O
they	OU
believed	OO
they	OO
were	OO
advancing	OO
science	.O
the	OU
bad	OO
news	OO
is	OO
that	OO
technology	OO
does	OO
not	OO
freeze	OO
in	OO
place	,O
and	OO
over	OO
the	OO
next	OO
few	OO
decades	,O
their	OO
feat	OO
will	OO
become	OO
trivially	OO
easy	.O
in	OU
fact	,O
it's	OO
already	OO
way	OO
easier	,O
because	OO
as	OO
we	OO
learned	OO
yesterday	OO
morning	,O
just	OO
two	OO
years	OO
after	OO
they	OO
did	OO
their	OO
work	,O
the	OO
crispr	OU
system	OO
was	OO
harnessed	OO
for	OO
genome	OO

this	OU
was	OO
a	OO
radical	OO
breakthrough	OO
that	OO
makes	OO
gene	OO
editing	OO
massively	OO
easier	OO
—	OO
so	OO
easy	OO
that	OO
crispr	OU
is	OO
now	OO
taught	OO
in	OO
high	OO
schools	.O
and	OU
this	OO
stuff	OO
is	OO
moving	OO
quicker	OO
than	OO
computing	.O
that	OU
slow	,O
stodgy	OO
white	OO
line	OO
up	OO
there	?O
that's	OU
moore's	OU
law	.O
that	OU
shows	OO
us	OO
how	OO
quickly	OO
computing	OO
is	OO
getting	OO
cheaper	.O
that	OU
steep	,O
crazy	OO

green	OO
line	,O
that	OO

us	OO
how	OO
quickly	OO
genetic	OO
sequencing	OO
is	OO
getting	OO
cheaper	.O
now	,U
gene	OO
editing	OO
and	OO
synthesis	OO
and	OO
sequencing	,O
they're	OO
different	OO
disciplines	,O
but	OO
they're	OO
tightly	OO
related	.O
and	OU
they're	OO
all	OO
moving	OO
in	OO
these	OO
headlong	OO
rates	.O
and	OU
the	OO
keys	OO
to	OO
the	OO
kingdom	OO
are	OO
these	OO
tiny	,O
tiny	OO
data	OO
files	.O
that	OU
is	OO
an	OO
excerpt	OO
of	OO
h5n1's	OU
genome	.O
the	OU
whole	OO
thing	OO
can	OO
fit	OO
on	OO
just	OO
a	OO
few	OO
pages	.O
and	OU
yeah	,O
don't	OO
worry	,O
you	OO
can	OO
google	OU
this	OO
as	OO
soon	OO
as	OO
you	OO
get	OO
home	.O
it's	OU
all	OO
over	OO
the	OO
internet	,O
right	?O
and	OU
the	OO
part	OO
that	OO
made	OO
it	OO
contagious	OO
could	OO
well	OO
fit	OO
on	OO
a	OO
single	OO
post	OU
it	OO
note	.O
and	OU
once	OO
a	OO
genius	OO
makes	OO
a	OO
data	OO
file	,O
any	OO
idiot	OO
can	OO
copy	OO
it	,O
distribute	OO
it	OO
worldwide	OO
or	OO
print	OO
it	.O
and	OU
i	OU
don't	OO
just	OO
mean	OO
print	OO
it	OO
on	OO
this	,O
but	OO
soon	OO
enough	,O
on	OO
this	.O
so	OU
let's	OO
imagine	OO
a	OO
scenario	.O
let's	OU
say	OO
it's	OO
2026	,O
to	OO
pick	OO
an	OO
arbitrary	OO
year	,O
and	OO
a	OO
brilliant	OO
virologist	,O
hoping	OO
to	OO
advance	OO
science	OO
and	OO
better	OO
understand	OO
pandemics	,O
designs	OO
a	OO
new	OO
bug	.O
it's	OU
as	OO
contagious	OO
as	OO
chicken	OO
pox	,O
it's	OO
as	OO
deadly	OO
as	OO
ebola	,U
and	OO
it	OO
incubates	OO
for	OO
months	OO
and	OO
months	OO
before	OO
causing	OO
an	OO
outbreak	,O
so	OO
the	OO
whole	OO
world	OO
can	OO
be	OO
infected	OO
before	OO
the	OO
first	OO
sign	OO
of	OO
trouble	.O
then	,U
her	OO
university	OO
gets	OO
hacked	.O
and	OU
of	OO
course	,O
this	OO
is	OO
not	OO
science	OO
fiction	.O
in	OU
fact	,O
just	OO
one	OO
recent	OO
us	OU
indictment	OO
documents	OO
the	OO
hacking	OO
of	OO
over	OO
300	OO
universities	.O
so	OU
that	OO
file	OO
with	OO
the	OO
bug's	OO
genome	OO
on	OO
it	OO
spreads	OO
to	OO
the	OO
internet's	OO
dark	OO
corners	.O
and	OU
once	OO
a	OO
file	OO
is	OO
out	OO
there	,O
it	OO
never	OO
comes	OO
back	OO
—	OO
just	OO
ask	OO
anybody	OO
who	OO
runs	OO
a	OO
movie	OO
studio	OO
or	OO
a	OO
music	OO
label	.O
so	OU
now	OO
maybe	OO
in	OO
2026	,O
it	OO
would	OO
take	OO
a	OO
true	OO
genius	OO
like	OO
our	OO
virologist	OO
to	OO
make	OO
the	OO
actual	OO
living	OO
critter	,O
but	OO
15	OO
years	OO
later	,O
it	OO
may	OO
just	OO
take	OO
a	OO
dna	OU
printer	OO
you	OO
can	OO
find	OO
at	OO
any	OO
high	OO
school	.O
and	OU
if	OO
not	?O
give	OU
it	OO
a	OO
couple	OO
of	OO
decades	.O
so	,U
a	OO
quick	OO
aside:	OO
remember	OU
this	OO
slide	OO
here	?O
turn	OU
your	OO
attention	OO
to	OO
these	OO
two	OO
words	.O
if	OU
somebody	OO
tries	OO
this	OO
and	OO
is	OO
only	OO
0.1	OO
percent	OO
effective	,O
eight	OO
million	OO
people	OO
die	.O
that's	OU
2,500	OO
9/11s	.O
civilization	OU
would	OO
survive	,O
but	OO
it	OO
would	OO
be	OO
permanently	OO
disfigured	.O
so	OU
this	OO
means	OO
we	OO
need	OO
to	OO
be	OO
concerned	OO
about	OO
anybody	OO
who	OO
has	OO
the	OO
faintest	OO
shot	OO
on	OO
goal	,O
not	OO
just	OO
geniuses	.O
so	OU
today	,O
there's	OO
a	OO
tiny	OO
handful	OO
of	OO
geniuses	OO
who	OO
probably	OO
could	OO
make	OO
a	OO
doomsday	OO
bug	OO
that's	OO
.1	OO
percent	OO
effective	OO
and	OO
maybe	OO
even	OO
a	OO
little	OO
bit	OO
more	.O
they	OU
tend	OO
to	OO
be	OO
stable	OO
and	OO
successful	OO
and	OO
so	OO
not	OO
part	OO
of	OO
this	OO
group	.O
so	OU
i	OU
guess	OO
i'm	OU
sorta	OO
kinda	OO
barely	OO
ok	OU
ish	OO
with	OO
that	.O
but	OU
what	OO
about	OO
after	OO
technology	OO
improves	OO
and	OO
diffuses	OO
and	OO
thousands	OO
of	OO
life	OO
science	OO
grad	OO
students	OO
are	OO
enabled	?O
are	OU
every	OO
single	OO
one	OO
of	OO
them	OO
going	OO
to	OO
be	OO
perfectly	OO
stable	?O
or	OU
how	OO
about	OO
a	OO
few	OO
years	OO
after	OO
that	,O
where	OO
every	OO
stress	OO
ridden	OO
premed	OO
is	OO
fully	OO
enabled	?O
at	OU
some	OO
point	OO
in	OO
that	OO
time	OO
frame	,O
these	OO
circles	OO
are	OO
going	OO
to	OO
intersect	,O
because	OO
we're	OO
now	OO
starting	OO
to	OO
talk	OO
about	OO
hundreds	OO
of	OO
thousands	OO
of	OO
people	OO
throughout	OO
the	OO
world	.O
and	OU
they	OO
recently	OO
included	OO
that	OO
guy	OO
who	OO
dressed	OO
up	OO
like	OO
the	OO
joker	OU
and	OO
shot	OO
12	OO
people	OO
to	OO
death	OO
at	OO
a	OO
batman	OU

that	OU
was	OO
a	OO
neuroscience	OO
phd	OU
student	OO
with	OO
an	OO
nih	OU
grant	.O
ok	,U
plot	OO
twist:	OO
i	OU
think	OO
we	OO
can	OO
actually	OO
survive	OO
this	OO
one	OO
if	OO
we	OO
start	OO
focusing	OO
on	OO
it	OO
now	.O
and	OU
i	OU
say	OO
this	,O
having	OO
spent	OO
countless	OO
hours	OO
interviewing	OO
global	OO
leaders	OO
in	OO
synbio	OO
and	OO
also	OO
researching	OO
their	OO

for	OO
science	OO
podcasts	OO
i	OU
create	.O
i	OU
have	OO
come	OO
to	OO
fear	OO
their	OO

in	OO
case	OO
i	OU
haven't	OO
gotten	OO
that	OO
out	OO
there	OO
yet	OO
—	OO
but	OO
more	OO
than	OO
that	,O
to	OO
revere	OO
its	OO
potential	.O
this	OU
stuff	OO
will	OO
cure	OO
cancer	,O
heal	OO
our	OO
environment	OO
and	OO
stop	OO
our	OO
cruel	OO
treatment	OO
of	OO
other	OO

so	OU
how	OO
do	OO
we	OO
get	OO
all	OO
this	OO
without	,O
you	OO
know	,O
annihilating	OO
ourselves	?O
first	OU
thing:	OO
like	OO
it	OO
or	OO
not	,O
synbio	OO
is	OO
here	,O
so	OO
let's	OO
embrace	OO
the	OO
technology	.O
if	OU
we	OO
do	OO
a	OO

ban	,O
that	OO
would	OO
only	OO
hand	OO
the	OO
wheel	OO
to	OO
bad	OO

unlike	OU

that	OO
very	OO
clear	,O
as	OO
does	OO
every	OO

in	OO
the	OO

secondly	,U
enlist	OO
the	OO

let's	OU

them	OO
up	OO
and	OO
make	OO
more	OO
of	OO
them	.O
for	OU
every	OO

we	OO

the	OU

you	.O

through	OO
a	OO

this	,O

you	OO
how	OO
much	OO
of	OO
an	OO
inspiration	OO
you	OO
are	.O
they	OU
say	OO
you're	OO
a	OO
warrior	.O
they	OU
call	OO
you	OO
a	OO
hero	,O
someone	OO
who's	OO
lived	OO
the	OO
mythical	OO
hero's	OO
journey	,O
who's	OO
endured	OO
impossible	OO
trials	OO
and	,O
against	OO
the	OO
odds	,O
lived	OO
to	OO
tell	OO
the	OO
tale	,O
returning	OO
better	OO
and	OO
braver	OO
for	OO
what	OO
you're	OO
been	OO
through	.O
and	OU
this	OO
definitely	OO
lines	OO
up	OO
with	OO
my	OO
experience	.O
cancer	OU
totally	OO
transformed	OO
my	OO
life	.O
i	OU
left	OO
the	OO
hospital	OO
knowing	OO
exactly	OO
who	OO
i	OU
was	OO
and	OO
what	OO
i	OU
wanted	OO
to	OO
do	OO
in	OO
the	OO
world	.O
and	OU
now	,O
every	OO
day	OO
as	OO
the	OO
sun	OO
rises	,O
i	OU
drink	OO
a	OO
big	OO
glass	OO
of	OO
celery	OO
juice	,O
and	OO
i	OU
follow	OO
this	OO
up	OO
with	OO
90	OO
minutes	OO
of	OO
yoga	.O
then	,U
i	OU
write	OO
down	OO
50	OO
things	OO
i'm	OU
grateful	OO
for	OO
onto	OO
a	OO
scroll	OO
of	OO
paper	OO
that	OO
i	OU
fold	OO
into	OO
an	OO
origami	OO
crane	OO
and	OO
send	OO
sailing	OO
out	OO
my	OO

are	OU
you	OO
seriously	OO
believing	OO
any	OO
of	OO
this	?O
i	OU
don't	OO
do	OO
any	OO
of	OO
these	OO
things	.O
i	OU
hate	OO
yoga	,O
and	OO
i	OU
have	OO
no	OO
idea	OO
how	OO
to	OO
fold	OO
an	OO
origami	OO
crane	.O
the	OU
truth	OO
is	OO
that	OO
for	OO
me	,O
the	OO
hardest	OO
part	OO
of	OO
my	OO
cancer	OO
experience	OO
began	OO
once	OO
the	OO
cancer	OO
was	OO
gone	.O
that	OU
heroic	OO
journey	OO
of	OO
the	OO
survivor	OO
we	OO
see	OO
in	OO
movies	OO
and	OO
watch	OO
play	OO
out	OO
on	OO
instagram	OU
—	OO
it's	OO
a	OO
myth	.O
it	OU
isn't	OO
just	OO
untrue	,O
it's	OO
dangerous	,O
because	OO
it	OO
erases	OO
the	OO
very	OO
real	OO
challenges	OO
of	OO
recovery	.O
now	,U
don't	OO
get	OO
me	OO
wrong	OO
—	OO
i	OU
am	OO
incredibly	OO
grateful	OO
to	OO
be	OO
alive	,O
and	OO
i	OU
am	OO
painfully	OO
aware	OO
that	OO
this	OO
struggle	OO
is	OO
a	OO
privilege	OO
that	OO
many	OO
don't	OO
get	OO
to	OO
experience	.O
but	OU
it's	OO
important	OO
that	OO
i	OU
tell	OO
you	OO
what	OO
this	OO
projection	OO
of	OO
heroism	OO
and	OO
expectation	OO
of	OO
constant	OO
gratitude	OO
does	OO
to	OO
people	OO
who	OO
are	OO
trying	OO
to	OO
recover	.O
because	OU
being	OO

is	OO
not	OO
where	OO
the	OO
work	OO
of	OO

ends	.O
it's	OU
where	OO
it	OO
begins	.O
i'll	OU
never	OO
forget	OO
the	OO
day	OO
i	OU
was	OO
discharged	OO
from	OO
the	OO
hospital	,O
finally	OO
done	OO
with	OO
treatment	.O
those	OU
four	OO
years	OO
of	OO

taken	OO
a	OO
toll	OO
on	OO
my	OO

with	OO
my	OO
longtime	OO
boyfriend	,O
and	OO
he'd	OO
recently	OO
moved	OO
out	.O
and	OU
when	OO
i	OU
walked	OO
into	OO
my	OO
apartment	,O
it	OO
was	OO
quiet	.O
eerily	OU
so	.O
the	OU
person	OO
i	OU
wanted	OO
to	OO
call	OO
in	OO
this	OO
moment	,O
the	OO
person	OO
who	OO
i	OU
knew	OO

understand	OO
everything	,O

my	OO

melissa	.U
she	OU
was	OO
a	OO
fellow	OO
cancer	OO
patient	,O
but	OO
she	OO
had	OO
died	OO
three	OO
weeks	OO
earlier	.O
as	OU
i	OU
stood	OO
there	OO
in	OO
the	OO
doorway	OO
of	OO
my	OO

i	OU
wanted	OO
to	OO
cry	.O
but	OU
i	OU
was	OO
too	OO
tired	OO
to	OO
cry	.O
the	OU
adrenaline	OO
was	OO
gone	.O
i	OU
had	OO
felt	OO
as	OO
if	OO
the	OO
inner	OO
scaffolding	OO
that	OO
had	OO
held	OO
me	OO
together	OO
since	OO
my	OO
diagnosis	OO
had	OO
suddenly	OO
crumbled	.O
i	OU
had	OO

the	OO
past	OO
1,500	OO
days	OO
working	OO
tirelessly	OO
to	OO
achieve	OO
one	OO
goal:	OO
to	OO

and	OU
now	OO
that	OO
i'd	OU
done	OO

absolutely	OO
no	OO
idea	OO
how	OO
to	OO
live	.O
on	OU
paper	,O
of	OO
course	,O
i	OU
was	OO
better:	OO
i	OU
didn't	OO
have	OO
leukemia	,O
my	OO
blood	OO
counts	OO
were	OO
back	OO
to	OO
normal	,O
and	OO
the	OO
disability	OO
checks	OO
soon	OO
stopped	OO
coming	.O
to	OU
the	OO
outside	OO

i	OU
clearly	OO
didn't	OO
belong	OO
in	OO
the	OO

of	OO
the	OO
sick	OO
anymore	.O
but	OU
in	OO
reality	,O
i	OU
never	OO
felt	OO
further	OO
from	OO
being	OO
well	.O
all	OU
that	OO
chemo	OO
had	OO
taken	OO
a	OO
permanent	OO
physical	OO

on	OO

i	OU
wondered	,O
what	OU

of	OO
job	OO
can	OO
i	OU
hold	OO
when	OO
i	OU
need	OO
to	OO
nap	OO
for	OO
four	OO
hours	OO
in	OO
the	OO

the	OO

when	OU
my	OO

sends	OO
me	OO
to	OO
the	OO

on	OO
a	OO

basis	?O
and	OU
then	OO
there	OO
were	OO
the	OO

behind:	OO
the	OO

the	OO

the	OO
demons	OO
of	OO
ptsd	OU
that	OO
descended	OO
upon	OO
me	OO
for	OO
days	,O
sometimes	OO
weeks	.O
see	,U
we	OO
talk	OO
about	OO
reentry	OO
in	OO
the	OO
context	OO
of	OO
war	OO
and	OO
incarceration	.O
but	OU
we	OO
don't	OO
talk	OO
about	OO
it	OO
as	OO
much	OO
in	OO
the	OO
context	OO
of	OO
other	OO
kinds	OO
of	OO
traumatic	OO
experiences	,O
like	OO
an	OO
illness	.O
because	OU
no	OO
one	OO
had	OO
warned	OO
me	OO
of	OO
the	OO
challenges	OO
of	OO
reentry	,O
i	OU
thought	OO
something	OO
must	OO
be	OO
wrong	OO
with	OO
me	.O
i	OU
felt	OO
ashamed	,O
and	OO
with	OO
great	OO
guilt	,O
i	OU
kept	OO
reminding	OO
myself	OO
of	OO
how	OO
lucky	OO
i	OU
was	OO
to	OO
be	OO
alive	OO
at	OO
all	,O
when	OO
so	OO
many	OO

my	OO

were	OO
not	.O
but	OU
on	OO
most	OO

i	OU
woke	OO
up	OO
feeling	OO
so	OO
sad	OO
and	OO
lost	,O
i	OU
could	OO
barely	OO
breathe	.O
sometimes	,U
i	OU
even	OO
fantasized	OO
about	OO
getting	OO
sick	OO
again	.O
and	OU
let	OO
me	OO
tell	OO
you	,O
there	OO
are	OO
so	OO
many	OO
better	OO
things	OO
to	OO
fantasize	OO
about	OO
when	OO
you're	OO
in	OO
your	OO
twenties	OO
and	OO
recently	OO
single	.O
but	OU
i	OU
missed	OO
the	OO
hospital's	OO
ecosystem	.O
like	OU
me	,O
everyone	OO
in	OO
there	OO
was	OO
broken	.O
but	OU
out	OO
here	,O
among	OO
the	OO
living	,O
i	OU
felt	OO
like	OO
an	OO
impostor	,O
overwhelmed	OO
and	OO
unable	OO
to	OO
function	.O
i	OU
also	OO
missed	OO
the	OO
sense	OO
of	OO
clarity	OO
i'd	OU
felt	OO
at	OO
my	OO
sickest	.O
staring	OU
your	OO
mortality	OO
straight	OO
in	OO
the	OO
eye	OO
has	OO
a	OO
way	OO
of	OO
simplifying	OO
things	,O
of	OO
rerouting	OO
your	OO
focus	OO
to	OO
what	OO
really	OO
matters	.O
and	OU
when	OO
i	OU
was	OO
sick	,O
i	OU
vowed	OO
that	OO
if	OO
i	OU
survived	,O
it	OO
had	OO
to	OO
be	OO
for	OO
something	.O
it	OU
had	OO
to	OO
be	OO
to	OO
live	OO
a	OO
good	OO
life	,O
an	OO
adventurous	OO
life	,O
a	OO
meaningful	OO
one	.O
but	OU
the	OO
question	,O
once	OO
i	OU
was	OO
cured	,O
became:	OO
how	?U
i	OU
was	OO
27	OO
years	OO
old	OO
with	OO
no	OO
job	,O
no	OO
partner	,O
no	OO
structure	.O
and	OU
this	OO
time	,O
i	OU
didn't	OO
have	OO
treatment	OO
protocols	OO
or	OO
discharge	OO
instructions	OO
to	OO
help	OO
guide	OO
my	OO
way	OO
forward	.O
but	OU
what	OO
i	OU
did	OO
have	OO
was	OO
an	OO
in	OO
box	OO
full	OO
of	OO
internet	OO
messages	OO
from	OO
strangers	.O
over	OU
the	OO
years	,O
people	OO
from	OO
all	OO
over	OO
the	OO

read	OO
my	OO
column	,O
and	OO
they'd	OO
responded	OO
with	OO
letters	,O
comments	OO
and	OO
emails	.O
it	OU
was	OO
a	OO
mix	,O
as	OO
is	OO
often	OO
the	OO
case	,O
for	OO
writers	.O
i	OU
got	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
unsolicited	OO
advice	OO
about	OO
how	OO
to	OO
cure	OO
my	OO
cancer	OO
with	OO
things	OO
like	OO
essential	OO

i	OU
got	OO
some	OO
questions	OO
about	OO
my	OO
bra	OO
size	.O
but	OU
mostly	OO
—	OO
mostly	,O
i	OU
heard	OO
from	OO
people	OO
who	,O
in	OO
their	OO
own	OO
different	OO
way	,O
understood	OO
what	OO
it	OO
was	OO
that	OO
i	OU
was	OO
going	OO
through	.O
i	OU
heard	OO
from	OO
a	OO
teenage	OO
girl	OO
in	OO
florida	OU
who	,O

me	,O
was	OO
coming	OO
out	OO
of	OO

and	OO
wrote	OO
me	OO
a	OO
message	OO
composed	OO
largely	OO
of	OO

i	OU
heard	OO
from	OO
a	OO
retired	OO
art	OO

in	OO
ohio	OU

who'd	OO
spent	OO

health	OO
condition	OO
that	OO
he'd	OO
had	OO
from	OO
the	OO
time	OO
he	OO
was	OO
a	OO
young	OO
man	.O
i	OU
heard	OO
from	OO
an	OO
inmate	OO
on	OO
death	OO

in	OO
texas	OU
by	OO
the	OO
name	OO
of	OO
little	OU

he'd	OU
never	OO

a	OO

he	OU
does	OO
1,000	OO
push	OO

to	OO

off	OO
each	OO

but	OU
he	OO
related	OO
to	OO
what	OO
i	OU
described	OO
in	OO
one	OO
column	OO
as	OO
my	OO
incanceration	,O
and	OO
to	OO
the	OO
experience	OO
of	OO
being	OO
confined	OO
to	OO
a	OO
tiny	OO
fluorescent	OO
room	.O
i	OU
know	OO
that	OO
our	OO
situations	OO
are	OO
different	,O
he	OO
wrote	OO
to	OO
me	,O
but	OU
the	OO
threat	OO
of	OO
death	OO
lurks	OO
in	OO
both	OO
of	OO
our	OO

in	OU
those	OO
lonely	OO
first	OO
weeks	OO
and	OO
months	OO
of	OO
my	OO
recovery	,O
these	OO
strangers	OO
and	OO
their	OO

dispatches	OO
from	OO
people	OO
of	OO
so	OO
many	OO
different	OO
backgrounds	,O
with	OO
so	OO
many	OO

all	OO
showing	OO
me	OO
the	OO

thing:	OO
you	OO
can	OO
be	OO

by	OO
the	OO

thing	OO
that's	OO
ever	OO
happened	OO
to	OO
you	OO

it	OO
to	OO

your	OO

you	OO
can	OO
find	OO
a	OO

forward	.O
i	OU
knew	OO
i	OU
needed	OO
to	OO
make	OO
some	OO

to	OO

back	OO
out	OO

so	OO
i	OU
decided	OO
to	OO
go	OO
on	OO
a	OO
real	OO
journey	OO
—	OO
not	OO
the	OO

or	OO
the	OO

that	OO
everyone	OO

on	,O
but	OO
a	OO
real	,O
pack	OO
your	OO
bags	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
journey	.O
i	OU
put	OO
everything	OO
i	OU
owned	OO
into	OO

rented	OO
out	OO
my	OO

borrowed	OO
a	OO
car	OO
and	OO
talked	OO
a	OO
very	OO
a	OO
dear	OO

somewhat	OO
smelly	OO
friend	OO
into	OO
joining	OO
me	.O
together	,U
my	OO
dog	OO
oscar	OU

i	OU
embarked	OO
on	OO
a	OO
15,000	OO
mile	OO
road	OO
trip	OO
around	OO
the	OO
united	OU

along	OU
the	OO

we	OO
visited	OO
some	OO
of	OO
those	OO
strangers	OO
who'd	OO

i	OU
needed	OO
their	OO
advice	,O
also	OO
to	OO

to	OO
them	,O

you	.O
i	OU
went	OO
to	OO

the	OO

when	OU
you've	OO
suffered	OO
a	OO
loss	OO
or	OO
a	OO
trauma	,O
the	OO
impulse	OO

be	OO
to	OO

your	OO

howard	OU
urged	OO
me	OO
to	OO
open	OO
myself	OO
up	OO
to	OO

to	OO
the	OO

of	OO

howard	OU
will	OO

as	OO
a	OO

he	OO
had	OO
no	OO

of	OO
predicting	OO
how	OO
long	OO

that	OO

him	OO
from	OO

takes	OO
weekly	OO

when	OU
i	OU
visited	OO
them	,O
they’d	OO
recently	OO
celebrated	OO
their	OO
50th	OO

in	OU
his	OO
letter	OO

me	,O

it's	OO
not	OO
in	OO
dinner	,O

what's	OO
left	OO
when	OO
everything	OO

is	OO
stripped	OO
away	.O
i	OU
went	OO
to	OO
texas	,U

time	OO
i'd	OU

really	,O
really	OO
good	OO
at	OO

he	OO
said	,O
me	,U

a	OO

in	OO
florida	,U
to	OO
see	OO
that	OO
teenage	OO
girl	OO
who'd	OO
sent	OO
me	OO
all	OO
those	OO
emojis	.O
her	OU
name	OO
is	OO
unique	,U
which	OO
is	OO
perfect	,O
because	OO
she's	OO
the	OO
most	OO
luminous	,O
curious	OO
person	OO
i've	OU
ever	OO
met	.O
i	OU
asked	OO
her	OO
what	OO
she	OO
wants	OO
to	OO
do	OO
next	OO
and	OO
she	OO
said	,O
i	OU
want	OO
to	OO
go	OO
to	OO
college	OO
and	OO
travel	OO
and	OO
eat	OO
weird	OO
foods	OO
like	OO
octopus	OO
that	OO
i've	OU
never	OO
tasted	OO
before	OO
and	OO
come	OO
visit	OO
you	OO
in	OO
new	OU
york	OU
and	OO
go	OO
camping	,O
but	OO
i'm	OU
scared	OO
of	OO
bugs	,O
but	OO
i	OU
still	OO
want	OO
to	OO
go	OO
camping	.O
i	OU
was	OO
in	OO
awe	OO
of	OO
her	,O
that	OO
she	OO
could	OO
be	OO
so	OO
optimistic	OO
and	OO
so	OO
full	OO
of	OO
plans	OO
for	OO
the	OO
future	,O
given	OO
everything	OO
she'd	OO
been	OO
through	.O
but	OU
as	OO
unique	OU
showed	OO
me	,O
it	OO
is	OO
far	OO
more	OO
radical	OO
and	OO
dangerous	OO
to	OO
have	OO
hope	OO
than	OO
to	OO
live	OO
hemmed	OO
in	OO
by	OO
fear	.O
but	OU
the	OO
most	OO
important	OO
thing	OO
i	OU
learned	OO
on	OO
that	OO
road	OO
trip	OO
is	OO
that	OO
the	OO
divide	OO
between	OO
the	OO
sick	OO
and	OO
the	OO
well	OO
—	OO
it	OO
doesn't	OO
exist	.O
the	OU
border	OO
is	OO
porous	.O
as	OU
we	OO
live	OO
longer	OO
and	OO
longer	,O
surviving	OO
illnesses	OO
and	OO
injuries	OO
that	OO
would	OO
have	OO
killed	OO
our	OO
grandparents	,O
even	OO
our	OO
parents	,O
the	OO
vast	OO
majority	OO
of	OO
us	OO
will	OO
travel	OO
back	OO
and	OO
forth	OO
between	OO
these	OO
realms	,O
spending	OO
much	OO
of	OO
our	OO
lives	OO
somewhere	OO
between	OO
the	OO
two	.O
these	OU
are	OO
the	OO
terms	OO
of	OO
our	OO
existence	.O
now	,U
i	OU
wish	OO
i	OU
could	OO
say	OO
that	OO
since	OO
coming	OO
home	OO
from	OO
my	OO
road	OO
trip	,O
i	OU
feel	OO
fully	OO
healed	.O
i	OU
don't	.O
but	OU
once	OO
i	OU
stopped	OO
expecting	OO
myself	OO
to	OO
return	OO
to	OO
the	OO
person	OO
i'd	OU
been	OO
pre	OO
diagnosis	,O
once	OO
i	OU
learned	OO
to	OO
accept	OO
my	OO
body	OO
and	OO
its	OO
limitations	,O
i	OU
actually	OO
did	OO
start	OO
to	OO
feel	OO
better	.O
and	OU
in	OO
the	OO
end	,O
i	OU
think	OO
that's	OO
the	OO
trick:	OO
to	OO
stop	OO
seeing	OO
our	OO
health	OO
as	OO
binary	,O
between	OO
sick	OO
and	OO
healthy	,O
well	OO
and	OO
unwell	,O
whole	OO
and	OO
broken;	OO
to	OO
stop	OO
thinking	OO
that	OO
there's	OO
some	OO
beautiful	,O
perfect	OO
state	OO
of	OO
wellness	OO
to	OO
strive	OO
for;	OO
and	OO
to	OO
quit	OO
living	OO
in	OO
a	OO
state	OO
of	OO
constant	OO
dissatisfaction	OO
until	OO
we	OO
reach	OO
it	.O
every	OU
single	OO
one	OO
of	OO
us	OO
will	OO
have	OO
our	OO
life	OO
interrupted	,O
whether	OO
it's	OO
by	OO
the	OO
rip	OO
cord	OO
of	OO
a	OO
diagnosis	OO
or	OO
some	OO
other	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
heartbreak	OO
or	OO
trauma	OO
that	OO
brings	OO
us	OO
to	OO
the	OO
floor	.O
we	OU
need	OO
to	OO
find	OO
ways	OO
to	OO
live	OO
in	OO
the	OO
in	OO
between	OO
place	,O
managing	OO
whatever	OO
body	OO
and	OO
mind	OO
we	OO
currently	OO
have	.O
sometimes	,U
all	OO
it	OO
takes	OO
is	OO
the	OO
ingenuity	OO
of	OO
a	OO
handmade	OO
game	OO
of	OO
scrabble	OU
or	OO
finding	OO
that	OO
stripped	OO
down	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
meaning	OO
in	OO
the	OO
love	OO
of	OO
family	OO
and	OO
a	OO
night	OO
on	OO
the	OO
ballroom	OO
dance	OO
floor	,O
or	OO
that	OO
radical	,O
dangerous	OO
hope	OO
that	OO
i'm	OU
guessing	OO
will	OO
someday	OO
lead	OO
a	OO
teenage	OO
girl	OO
terrified	OO
of	OO
bugs	OO
to	OO
go	OO
camping	.O
if	OU
you're	OO
able	OO
to	OO
do	OO
that	,O
then	OO
you've	OO
taken	OO
the	OO
real	OO
hero's	OO
journey	.O
you've	OU
achieved	OO
what	OO
it	OO
means	OO
to	OO
actually	OO
be	OO
well	,O
which	OO
is	OO
to	OO
say:	OO
alive	,O
in	OO
the	OO
messiest	,O
richest	,O
most	OO
whole	OO
sense	.O
thank	OU
you	,O
that's	OO
all	OO
i've	OU
got	.O
thank	OU
you	.O
for	OU
thousands	OO
of	OO
years	,O
well	,O
really	OO
probably	OO
millions	OO
of	OO
years	,O
our	OO
ancestors	OO
have	OO
looked	OO
up	OO
at	OO
the	OO
sky	OO
and	OO
wondered	OO
what's	OO
up	OO
there	,O
and	OO
they've	OO
also	OO
started	OO
to	OO
wonder	,O
hmm	,O
could	OO
we	OO
be	OO
alone	OO
in	OO
this	OO
planet	?O
now	,U
i'm	OU
fortunate	OO
that	OO
i	OU
get	OO
to	OO
get	OO
paid	OO
to	OO
actually	OO
ask	OO
some	OO
of	OO
those	OO
questions	,O
and	OO
sort	OO
of	OO
bad	OO
news	OO
for	OO
you	,O
your	OO
tax	OO
dollars	OO
are	OO
paying	OO
me	OO
to	OO
try	OO
to	OO
answer	OO
some	OO
of	OO
those	OO
questions	.O
but	OU
then	,O
about	OO
10	OO
years	OO
ago	,O
i	OU
was	OO
told	,O
i	OU
mean	OO
asked	,O
if	OO
i	OU
would	OO
start	OO
to	OO
look	OO
at	OO
the	OO
technology	OO
to	OO
help	OO
get	OO
us	OO
off	OO
planet	,O
and	OO
so	OO
that's	OO
what	OO
i'm	OU
going	OO
to	OO
talk	OO
to	OO
you	OO
about	OO
today	.O
so	OU
playing	OO
to	OO
the	OO
local	OO
crowd	,O
this	OO
is	OO
what	OO
it	OO
looks	OO
like	OO
in	OO
your	OO
day	OO
to	OO
day	OO
life	OO
in	OO
boston	,U
but	OO
as	OO
you	OO
start	OO
to	OO
go	OO
off	OO
planet	,O
things	OO
look	OO
very	,O
very	OO
different	.O
so	OU
there	OO
we	OO
are	,O
hovering	OO
above	OO
the	OO
wgbh	OU
studios	.O
and	OU
here's	OO
a	OO
very	OO
famous	OO
picture	OO
of	OO
the	OO
earthrise	OU
from	OO
the	OO
moon	,U
and	OO
you	OO
can	OO
see	OO
the	OO
earth	OU
starting	OO
to	OO
recede	.O
and	OU
then	OO
what	OO
i	OU
love	OO
is	OO
this	OO
picture	OO
that	OO
was	OO
taken	OO
from	OO
the	OO
surface	OO
of	OO
mars	OU
looking	OO
back	OO
at	OO
the	OO
earth	.U
can	OU
anyone	OO
find	OO
the	OO
earth	?U
i'm	OU
going	OO
to	OO
help	OO
you	OO
out	OO
a	OO
little	.O
yeah	.U
the	OU
point	OO
of	OO
showing	OO
this	OO
is	OO
that	OO
when	OO
people	OO
start	OO
to	OO
go	OO
to	OO
mars	,U
they're	OO
not	OO
going	OO
to	OO
be	OO
able	OO
to	OO
keep	OO
calling	OO
in	OO
and	OO
be	OO
micromanaged	OO
the	OO
way	OO
people	OO
on	OO
a	OO
space	OO
station	OO
are	.O
they're	OU
going	OO
to	OO
have	OO
to	OO
be	OO
independent	.O
so	OU
even	OO
though	OO
they're	OO
up	OO
there	,O
there	OO
are	OO
going	OO
to	OO
be	OO
all	OO
sorts	OO
of	OO
things	OO
that	OO
they're	OO
going	OO
to	OO
need	,O
just	OO
like	OO
people	OO
on	OO
earth	OU
need	OO
things	OO
like	,O
oh	,O
transportation	,O
life	OO
support	,O
food	,O
clothing	OO
and	OO
so	OO
on	.O
but	OU
unlike	OO
on	OO
earth	,U
they	OO
are	OO
also	OO
going	OO
to	OO
need	OO
oxygen	.O
they're	OU
going	OO
to	OO
have	OO
to	OO
deal	OO
with	OO
about	OO
a	OO
third	OO
of	OO
the	OO
gravity	OO
that	OO
we	OO
have	OO
here	.O
they're	OU
going	OO
to	OO
have	OO
to	OO
worry	OO
about	OO
habitats	,O
power	,O
heat	,O
light	OO
and	OO
radiation	OO
protection	,O
something	OO
that	OO
we	OO
don't	OO
actually	OO
worry	OO
about	OO
nearly	OO
as	OO
much	OO
on	OO
the	OO
earth	,U
because	OO
we	OO
have	OO
this	OO
beautiful	OO
atmosphere	OO
and	OO
magnetosphere	.O
the	OU
problem	OO
with	OO
that	OO
is	OO
that	OO
we	OO
also	OO
have	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
constraints	.O
so	OU
the	OO
biggest	OO
one	OO
for	OO
us	OO
is	OO
upmass	,O
and	OO
the	OO
number	OO
that	OO
i've	OU
used	OO
for	OO
years	OO
is	OO
it	OO
costs	OO
about	OO
10,000	OO
dollars	OO
to	OO
launch	OO
a	OO
can	OO
of	OO
coke	OU
into	OO
low	OO
earth	OU
orbit	.O
the	OU
problem	OO
is	,O
there	OO
you	OO
are	OO
with	OO
10,000	OO
dollars	OO
later	,O
and	OO
you're	OO
still	OO
in	OO
low	OO
earth	OU
orbit	.O
you're	OU
not	OO
even	OO
at	OO
the	OO
moon	OU
or	OO
mars	OU
or	OO
anything	OO
else	.O
so	OU
you're	OO
going	OO
to	OO
have	OO
to	OO
try	OO
to	OO
figure	OO
out	OO
how	OO
to	OO
keep	OO
the	OO
mass	OO
as	OO
low	OO
as	OO
possible	OO
so	OO
you	OO
don't	OO
have	OO
to	OO
launch	OO
it	.O
but	OU
on	OO
top	OO
of	OO
that	OO
cost	OO
issue	OO
with	OO
the	OO
mass	,O
you	OO
also	OO
have	OO
problems	OO
of	OO
storage	OO
and	OO
flexibility	OO
and	OO
reliability	.O
you	OU
can't	OO
just	OO
get	OO
there	OO
and	OO
say	,O
oops	,U
i	OU
forgot	OO
to	OO
bring	,O
because	OO
amazon.com	OU
just	OO
does	OO
not	OO
deliver	OO
to	OO
mars	.U
so	OU
you	OO
better	OO
be	OO
prepared	.O
so	OU
what	OO
is	OO
the	OO
solution	OO
for	OO
this	?O
and	OU
i'm	OU
going	OO
to	OO
propose	OO
to	OO
you	OO
for	OO
the	OO
rest	OO
of	OO
this	OO
talk	OO
that	OO
the	OO
solution	OO
actually	OO
is	OO
life	,O
and	OO
when	OO
you	OO
start	OO
to	OO
look	OO
at	OO
life	OO
as	OO
a	OO
technology	,O
you	OO
realize	,O
ah	,O
that's	OO
it	,O
that's	OO
exactly	OO
what	OO
we	OO
needed	.O
this	OU
plant	OO
here	,O
like	OO
every	OO
person	OO
here	OO
and	OO
every	OO
one	OO
of	OO
your	OO
dogs	OO
and	OO
cats	OO
and	OO
plants	OO
and	OO
so	OO
on	,O
all	OO
started	OO
as	OO
a	OO
single	OO
cell	.O
so	OU
imagine	,O
you're	OO
starting	OO
as	OO
a	OO
very	OO
low	OO
upmass	OO
object	OO
and	OO
then	OO
growing	OO
into	OO
something	OO
a	OO
good	OO
deal	OO
bigger	.O
now	,U
my	OO
hero	OO
charles	OU
darwin	,U
of	OO
course	,O
reminds	OO
us	OO
that	OO
there's	OO
no	OO
such	OO
thing	OO
as	OO
a	OO
designer	OO
in	OO
biology	,O
but	OO
what	OO
if	OO
we	OO
now	OO
have	OO
the	OO
technology	OO
to	OO
design	OO
biology	,O
maybe	OO
even	OO
design	,O
oh	,O
whole	OO
new	OO
life	OO
forms	OO
that	OO
can	OO
do	OO
things	OO
for	OO
us	OO
that	OO
we	OO
couldn't	OO
have	OO
imagined	OO
otherwise	?O
so	OU
years	OO
ago	,O
i	OU
was	OO
asked	OO
to	OO
start	OO
to	OO
sell	OO
this	OO
program	,O
and	OO
while	OO
i	OU
was	OO
doing	OO
that	,O
i	OU
was	OO
put	OO
in	OO
front	OO
of	OO
a	OO
panel	OO
at	OO
nasa	,U
as	OO
you	OO
might	OO
sort	OO
of	OO
imagine	,O
a	OO
bunch	OO
of	OO
people	OO
in	OO
suits	OO
and	OO
white	OO
shirts	OO
and	OO
pencil	OO
protectors	,O
and	OO
i	OU
did	OO
this	OO
sort	OO
of	OO
crazy	,O
wild	,O
this	OU
is	OO
all	OO
the	OO
next	OO
great	OO
thing	,O
and	OO
i	OU
thought	OO
they	OO
would	OO
be	OO
blown	OO
over	,O
and	OO
instead	OO
the	OO
chairman	OO
of	OO
the	OO
committee	OO
just	OO
looked	OO
at	OO
me	OO
straight	OO
in	OO
the	OO
eye	,O
and	OO
said	,O
so	OU
what's	OO
the	OO
big	OO
idea	?O
so	OU
i	OU
was	OO
like	,O
ok	,U
you	OO
want	OO
star	OU
trek	?U
we'll	OU
do	OO
star	OU
trek	.U
and	OU
so	OO
let	OO
me	OO
tell	OO
you	OO
what	OO
the	OO
big	OO
idea	OO
is	.O
we've	OU
used	OO
organisms	OO
to	OO
make	OO
biomaterials	OO
for	OO
years	.O
so	OU
here's	OO
a	OO
great	OO
picture	OO
taken	OO
outside	OO
of	OO
glasgow	,U
and	OO
you	OO
can	OO
see	OO
lots	OO
of	OO
great	OO
biomaterials	OO
there	.O
there	OU
are	OO
trees	OO
that	OO
you	OO
could	OO
use	OO
to	OO
build	OO
houses	.O
there	OU
are	OO
sheep	OO
where	OO
you	OO
can	OO
get	OO
your	OO
wool	OO
from	.O
you	OU
could	OO
get	OO
leather	OO
from	OO
the	OO
sheep	.O
just	OU
quickly	OO
glancing	OO
around	OO
the	OO
room	,O
i'll	OU
bet	OO
there's	OO
no	OO
one	OO
in	OO
this	OO
room	OO
that	OO
doesn't	OO
have	OO
some	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
animal	OO
or	OO
plant	OO
product	OO
on	OO
them	,O
some	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
biomaterial	.O
but	OU
you	OO
know	OO
what	?O
we're	OU
not	OO
going	OO
to	OO
take	OO
sheep	OO
and	OO
trees	OO
and	OO
stuff	OO
to	OO
mars	.U
that's	OU
nuts	,O
because	OO
of	OO
the	OO
upmass	OO
problem	.O
but	OU
we	OO
are	OO
going	OO
to	OO
take	OO
things	OO
like	OO
this	.O
this	OU
is	OO
bacillus	OU
subtilis	.O
those	OU
white	OO
dots	OO
that	OO
you	OO
see	OO
are	OO
spores	.O
this	OU
happens	OO
to	OO
be	OO
a	OO
bacterium	OO
that	OO
can	OO
form	OO
incredibly	OO
resistant	OO
spores	,O
and	OO
when	OO
i	OU
say	OO
incredibly	OO
resistant	,O
they've	OO
proven	OO
themselves	.O
bacillus	OU
subtilis	OO
spores	OO
have	OO
been	OO
flown	OO
on	OO
what	OO
was	OO
called	OO
ldef	,U
long	OU
duration	OU
exposure	OU
facility	,U
for	OO
almost	OO
six	OO
years	OO
and	OO
some	OO
of	OO
them	OO
survived	OO
that	OO
in	OO
space	.O
unbelievable	,U
a	OO
lot	OO
better	OO
than	OO
any	OO
of	OO
us	OO
can	OO
do	.O
so	OU
why	OO
not	OO
just	OO
take	OO
the	OO
capabilities	,O
like	OO
to	OO
make	OO
wood	OO
or	OO
to	OO
make	OO
wool	OO
or	OO
spider	OO
silk	OO
or	OO
whatever	,O
and	OO
put	OO
them	OO
in	OO
bacillus	OU
subtilis	OO
spores	,O
and	OO
take	OO
those	OO
with	OO
you	OO
off	OO
planet	?O
so	OU
what	OO
are	OO
you	OO
going	OO
to	OO
do	OO
when	OO
you're	OO
off	OO
planet	?O
here's	OU
an	OO
iconic	OO
picture	OO
of	OO
buzz	OU
aldrin	OU
looking	OO
back	OO
at	OO
the	OO
eagle	OU
when	OO
he	OO
landed	,O
oh	,O
it	OO
was	OO
almost	OO
50	OO
years	OO
ago	,O
on	OO
the	OO
surface	OO
of	OO
the	OO
moon	.U
now	OU
if	OO
you're	OO
going	OO
to	OO
go	OO
to	OO
the	OO
moon	OU
for	OO
three	OO
days	OO
and	OO
you're	OO
the	OO
first	OO
person	OO
to	OO
set	OO
foot	,O
yeah	,O
you	OO
can	OO
live	OO
in	OO
a	OO
tin	OO
can	,O
but	OO
you	OO
wouldn't	OO
want	OO
to	OO
do	OO
that	OO
for	,O
say	,O
a	OO
year	OO
and	OO
a	OO
half	.O
so	OU
i	OU
did	OO
actually	OO
a	OO
calculation	,O
being	OO
in	OO
california	.U
i	OU
looked	OO
at	OO
what	OO
the	OO
average	OO
size	OO
of	OO
a	OO
cell	OO
at	OO
alcatraz	OU
is	,O
and	OO
i	OU
have	OO
news	OO
for	OO
you	,O
the	OO
volume	OO
in	OO
the	OO
eagle	OU
there	,O
in	OO
the	OO
lunar	OU
module	,U
was	OO
about	OO
the	OO
size	OO
of	OO
a	OO
cell	OO
at	OO
alcatraz	OU
if	OO
it	OO
were	OO
only	OO
five	OO
feet	OO
high	.O
so	OU
incredibly	OO
cramped	OO
living	OO
quarters	.O
you	OU
just	OO
can't	OO
ask	OO
a	OO
human	OO
to	OO
stay	OO
in	OO
there	OO
for	OO
long	OO
periods	OO
of	OO
time	.O
so	OU
why	OO
not	OO
take	OO
these	OO
biomaterials	OO
and	OO
make	OO
something	?O
so	OU
here's	OO
an	OO
image	OO
that	OO
a	OO
colleague	OO
of	OO
mine	OO
who	OO
is	OO
an	OO
architect	,O
chris	OU
maurer	,U
has	OO
done	OO
of	OO
what	OO
we've	OO
been	OO
proposing	,O
and	OO
we'll	OO
get	OO
to	OO
the	OO
point	OO
of	OO
why	OO
i've	OU
been	OO
standing	OO
up	OO
here	OO
holding	OO
something	OO
that	OO
looks	OO
like	OO
a	OO
dried	OO
sandwich	OO
this	OO
whole	OO
lecture	.O
so	OU
we've	OO
proposed	OO
that	OO
the	OO
solution	OO
to	OO
the	OO
habitat	OO
problem	OO
on	OO
mars	OU
could	OO
just	OO
simply	OO
lie	OO
in	OO
a	OO
fungus	.O
so	OU
i'm	OU
now	OO
probably	OO
going	OO
to	OO
turn	OO
off	OO
everyone	OO
from	OO
ever	OO
eating	OO
a	OO
mushroom	OO
again	.O
so	OU
let's	OO
talk	OO
about	OO
fungi	OO
for	OO
a	OO
second	.O
so	OU
you're	OO
probably	OO
familiar	OO
with	OO
this	OO
fruiting	OO
body	OO
of	OO
the	OO
fungus	.O
that's	OU
the	OO
mushroom	.O
but	OU
what	OO
we're	OO
interested	OO
in	OO
actually	OO
is	OO
what's	OO
beneath	OO
the	OO
surface	OO
there	,O
the	OO
mycelium	,O
which	OO
are	OO
these	OO
root	OO
hair	OO
like	OO
structures	OO
that	OO
are	OO
really	OO
the	OO
main	OO
part	OO
of	OO
the	OO
mushroom	.O
well	,U
it	OO
turns	OO
out	OO
you	OO
can	OO
take	OO
those	OO
—	OO
there's	OO
a	OO
micrograph	OO
i	OU
did	OO
—	OO
and	OO
you	OO
can	OO
put	OO
them	OO
in	OO
a	OO
mold	OO
and	OO
give	OO
them	OO
a	OO
little	OO
food	OO
—	OO
and	OO
it	OO
doesn't	OO
take	OO
much	,O
you	OO
can	OO
grow	OO
these	OO
things	OO
on	OO
sawdust	OO
—	OO
so	OO
this	OO
piece	OO
here	OO
was	OO
grown	OO
on	OO
sawdust	,O
and	OO
that	OO
mycelium	OO
then	OO
will	OO
fill	OO
that	OO
structure	OO
to	OO
make	OO
something	.O
we've	OU
actually	OO
tried	OO
growing	OO
mycelium	OO
on	OO
mars	OU
simulant	.U
so	OU
no	OO
one's	OO
actually	OO
gone	OO
to	OO
the	OO
surface	OO
of	OO
mars	,U
but	OO
this	OO
is	OO
a	OO
simulated	OO
surface	OO
of	OO
mars	,U
and	OO
you	OO
can	OO
see	OO
those	OO
hair	OO
like	OO
mycelia	OO
out	OO
there	.O
it's	OU
really	OO
amazing	OO
stuff	.O
how	OU
strong	OO
can	OO
you	OO
make	OO
these	OO
things	?O
well	,U
you	OO
know	,O
i	OU
could	OO
give	OO
you	OO
numbers	OO
and	OO
tests	OO
and	OO
so	OO
on	,O
but	OO
i	OU
think	OO
that's	OO
probably	OO
the	OO
best	OO
way	OO
to	OO
describe	OO
it	.O
there's	OU
one	OO
of	OO
my	OO
students	OO
proving	OO
that	OO
you	OO
can	OO
do	OO
this	.O
to	OU
do	OO
this	,O
then	,O
you've	OO
got	OO
to	OO
figure	OO
out	OO
how	OO
to	OO
put	OO
it	OO
in	OO
context	.O
how's	OU
this	OO
actually	OO
going	OO
to	OO
happen	?O
i	OU
mean	,O
this	OO
is	OO
a	OO
great	OO
idea	,O
lynn	,U
but	OO
how	OO
are	OO
you	OO
going	OO
to	OO
get	OO
from	OO
here	OO
to	OO
there	?O
so	OU
what	OO
we're	OO
saying	OO
is	OO
you	OO
grow	OO
up	OO
the	OO
mycelium	OO
in	OO
the	OO
lab	,O
for	OO
example	OO
and	OO
then	OO
you	OO
fill	OO
up	OO
a	OO
little	OO
structure	,O
maybe	OO
a	OO
house	OO
like	OO
structure	OO
that's	OO
tiny	,O
that	OO
is	OO
maybe	OO
a	OO
double	OO
bagged	OO
sort	OO
of	OO
plastic	OO
thing	,O
like	OO
an	OO
inflatable	OO
—	OO
i	OU
sort	OO
of	OO
think	OO
l.l.bean	OU
when	OO
i	OU
see	OO
this	.O
and	OU
then	OO
you	OO
put	OO
it	OO
in	OO
a	OO
rocket	OO
ship	OO
and	OO
you	OO
send	OO
it	OO
off	OO
to	OO
mars	.U
rocket	OU
lands	,O
you	OO
release	OO
the	OO
bag	OO
and	OO
you	OO
add	OO
a	OO
little	OO
water	,O
and	OO
voila	,O
you've	OO
got	OO
your	OO
habitat	.O
you	OU
know	,O
how	OO
cool	OO
would	OO
that	OO
be	?O
and	OU
the	OO
beauty	OO
of	OO
that	OO
is	OO
you	OO
don't	OO
have	OO
to	OO
take	OO
something	OO
prebuilt	.O
and	OU
so	OO
our	OO
estimates	OO
are	OO
that	OO
we	OO
could	OO
save	OO
90	OO
percent	OO
of	OO
the	OO
mass	OO
that	OO
nasa	OU
is	OO
currently	OO
proposing	OO
by	OO
taking	OO
up	OO
a	OO
big	OO
steel	OO
structure	OO
if	OO
we	OO
actually	OO
grow	OO
it	OO
on	OO
site	.O
so	OU
let	OO
me	OO
give	OO
you	OO
another	OO
big	OO
idea	.O
what	OU
about	OO
digital	OO
information	?O
what's	OU
really	OO
interesting	OO
is	OO
you	OO
have	OO
a	OO
physical	OO
link	OO
to	OO
your	OO
parents	OO
and	OO
they	OO
have	OO
a	OO
physical	OO
link	OO
to	OO
their	OO
parents	,O
and	OO
so	OO
on	,O
all	OO
the	OO
way	OO
back	OO
to	OO
the	OO
origin	OO
of	OO
life	.O
you	OU
have	OO
never	OO
broken	OO
that	OO
continuum	.O
but	OU
the	OO
fact	OO
is	OO
that	OO
we	OO
can	OO
do	OO
that	OO
today	.O
so	OU
we	OO
have	OO
students	OO
every	OO
day	OO
in	OO
our	OO
labs	OO
—	OO
students	OO
in	OO
boston	OU
even	OO
do	OO
this	OO
—	OO
that	OO
make	OO
up	OO
dna	OU
sequences	OO
and	OO
they	OO
hit	OO
the	OO
send	OO
button	OO
and	OO
they	OO
send	OO
them	OO
to	OO
their	OO
local	OO
dna	OU
synthesis	OO
company	.O
now	OU
once	OO
you	OO
break	OO
that	OO
physical	OO
link	OO
where	OO
you're	OO
sending	OO
it	OO
across	OO
town	,O
it	OO
doesn't	OO
matter	OO
if	OO
you're	OO
sending	OO
it	OO
across	OO
the	OO
charles	OU
river	OU
or	OO
if	OO
you're	OO
sending	OO
that	OO
information	OO
to	OO
mars	.U
you've	OU
broken	OO
that	OO
physical	OO
link	.O
so	OU
then	,O
once	OO
you're	OO
on	OO
mars	,U
or	OO
across	OO
the	OO
river	OO
or	OO
wherever	,O
you	OO
can	OO
take	OO
that	OO
digital	OO
information	,O
synthesize	OO
the	OO
physical	OO
dna	,U
put	OO
it	OO
maybe	OO
in	OO
another	OO
organism	OO
and	OO
voila	,O
you've	OO
got	OO
new	OO
capabilities	OO
there	.O
so	OU
again	,O
you've	OO
broken	OO
that	OO
physical	OO
link	.O
that's	OU
huge	.O
what	OU
about	OO
chemistry	?O
biology	OU
does	OO
chemistry	OO
for	OO
us	OO
on	OO
earth	,U
and	OO
again	OO
has	OO
for	OO
literally	OO
thousands	OO
of	OO
years	.O
i	OU
bet	OO
virtually	OO
everyone	OO
in	OO
this	OO
room	OO
has	OO
eaten	OO
something	OO
today	OO
that	OO
has	OO
been	OO
made	OO
by	OO
biology	OO
doing	OO
chemistry	.O
let	OU
me	OO
give	OO
you	OO
a	OO
big	OO
hint	OO
there	.O
what	OU
about	OO
another	OO
idea	?O
what	OU
about	OO
using	OO
dna	OU
itself	OO
to	OO
make	OO
a	OO
wire	?O
because	OU
again	,O
we're	OO
trying	OO
to	OO
miniaturize	OO
everything	.O
dna	OU
is	OO
really	OO
cheap	.O
strawberries	OU
have	OO
a	OO
gazillion	OO
amount	OO
of	OO
dna	.U
you	OU
know	,O
you	OO
could	OO
take	OO
a	OO
strawberry	OO
with	OO
you	,O
isolate	OO
the	OO
dna	,U
and	OO
one	OO
of	OO
my	OO
students	OO
has	OO
figured	OO
out	OO
a	OO
way	OO
to	OO
take	OO
dna	OU
and	OO
tweak	OO
it	OO
a	OO
little	OO
bit	OO
so	OO
that	OO
you	OO
can	OO
incorporate	OO
silver	OO
atoms	OO
in	OO
very	OO
specific	OO
places	,O
thus	OO
making	OO
an	OO
electrical	OO
wire	.O
how	OU
cool	OO
is	OO
that	?O
so	OU
while	OO
we're	OO
on	OO
the	OO
subject	OO
of	OO
metals	,O
we're	OO
going	OO
to	OO
need	OO
to	OO
use	OO
metals	OO
for	OO
things	OO
like	OO
integrated	OO
circuits	.O
probably	OU
we're	OO
going	OO
to	OO
want	OO
it	OO
for	OO
some	OO
structures	,O
and	OO
so	OO
on	.O
and	OU
things	OO
like	OO
integrated	OO
circuits	OO
ultimately	OO
go	OO
bad	.O
we	OU
could	OO
talk	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
about	OO
that	,O
but	OO
i'm	OU
going	OO
to	OO
leave	OO
it	OO
at	OO
that	,O
that	OO
they	OO
do	OO
go	OO
bad	,O
and	OO
so	OO
where	OO
are	OO
you	OO
going	OO
to	OO
get	OO
those	OO
metals	?O
yeah	,U
you	OO
could	OO
try	OO
to	OO
mine	OO
them	OO
with	OO
heavy	OO
equipment	,O
but	OO
you	OO
get	OO
that	OO
upmass	OO
problem	.O
and	OU
i	OU
always	OO
tell	OO
people	,O
the	OO
best	OO
way	OO
to	OO
find	OO
the	OO
metals	OO
for	OO
a	OO
new	OO
cell	OO
phone	OO
is	OO
in	OO
a	OO
dead	OO
cell	OO
phone	.O
so	OU
what	OO
if	OO
you	OO
take	OO
biology	OO
as	OO
the	OO
technology	OO
to	OO
get	OO
these	OO
metals	OO
out	?O
and	OU
how	OO
do	OO
you	OO
do	OO
this	?O
well	,U
take	OO
a	OO
look	OO
at	OO
the	OO
back	OO
of	OO
a	OO
vitamin	OO
bottle	OO
and	OO
you'll	OO
get	OO
an	OO
idea	OO
of	OO
all	OO
the	OO
sorts	OO
of	OO
metals	OO
that	OO
we	OO
actually	OO
use	OO
in	OO
our	OO
bodies	.O
so	OU
we	OO
have	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
proteins	OO
as	OO
well	OO
as	OO
other	OO
organisms	OO
that	OO
can	OO
actually	OO
specifically	OO
bind	OO
metals	.O
so	OU
what	OO
if	OO
we	OO
now	OO
take	OO
those	OO
proteins	OO
and	OO
maybe	OO
attach	OO
them	OO
to	OO
this	OO
fungal	OO
mycelium	OO
and	OO
make	OO
a	OO
filter	OO
so	OO
we	OO
can	OO
start	OO
to	OO
pull	OO
those	OO
metals	OO
out	OO
in	OO
a	OO
very	OO
specific	OO
way	OO
without	OO
big	OO
mining	OO
equipment	,O
and	,O
even	OO
better	,O
we've	OO
actually	OO
got	OO
a	OO
proof	OO
of	OO
concept	OO
where	OO
we've	OO
then	OO
taken	OO
those	OO
metals	OO
that	OO
we	OO
pulled	OO
out	OO
with	OO
proteins	OO
and	OO
reprinted	OO
an	OO
integrated	OO
circuit	OO
using	OO
a	OO
plasma	OO
printer	.O
again	,U
how	OO
cool	?O
electricity:	OU
i	OU
was	OO
asked	OO
by	OO
a	OO
head	OO
of	OO
one	OO
of	OO
the	OO
nasa	OU
centers	OO
if	OO
you	OO
could	OO
ever	OO
take	OO
chemical	OO
energy	OO
and	OO
turn	OO
that	OO
into	OO
electrical	OO
energy	.O
well	,U
the	OO
great	OO
news	OO
is	OO
it's	OO
not	OO
just	OO
the	OO
electric	OO
eel	OO
that	OO
does	OO
it	.O
everybody	OU
in	OO
this	OO
room	OO
who	OO
is	OO
still	OO
alive	OO
and	OO
functioning	OO
is	OO
doing	OO
that	.O
part	OU
of	OO
the	OO
food	OO
that	OO
you've	OO
eaten	OO
today	OO
has	OO
gone	OO
to	OO
operate	OO
the	OO
nerve	OO
cells	OO
in	OO
your	OO
body	.O
but	OU
even	OO
other	OO
organisms	,O
nonsentient	OO
ones	,O
are	OO
creating	OO
electric	OO
energy	,O
even	OO
bacteria	.O
some	OU
bacteria	OO
are	OO
very	OO
good	OO
at	OO
making	OO
little	OO
wires	.O
so	OU
if	OO
we	OO
can	OO
harvest	OO
that	OO
ability	OO
of	OO
turning	OO
chemical	OO
energy	OO
into	OO
electrical	OO
energy	,O
again	,O
how	OO
cool	OO
would	OO
that	OO
be	?O
so	OU
here	OO
are	OO
some	OO
of	OO
the	OO
big	OO
ideas	OO
we	OO
talked	OO
about	.O
let	OU
me	OO
try	OO
one	OO
more:	OO
life	OO
2.0	.O
so	OU
for	OO
example	,O
all	OO
of	OO
the	OO
sugars	OO
in	OO
our	OO
body	OO
are	OO
right	OO
handed	.O
why	OU
shouldn't	OO
we	OO
make	OO
an	OO
organism	OO
with	OO
left	OO
handed	OO
sugars	?O
why	OU
not	OO
make	OO
an	OO
organism	OO
that	OO
can	OO
do	OO
things	OO
that	OO
no	OO
organism	OO
can	OO
do	OO
today	?O
so	OU
organisms	OO
normally	OO
have	OO
evolved	OO
to	OO
live	OO
in	OO
very	OO
specific	OO
environments	.O
so	OU
here's	OO
this	OO
lion	OO
cub	OO
literally	OO
up	OO
a	OO
tree	,O
and	OO
i	OU
took	OO
a	OO
picture	OO
of	OO
him	OO
a	OO
bit	OO
later	,O
and	OO
he	OO
was	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
happier	OO
when	OO
he	OO
was	OO
down	OO
on	OO
the	OO
ground	.O
so	OU
organisms	OO
are	OO
designed	OO
for	OO
specific	OO
environments	.O
but	OU
what	OO
if	OO
you	OO
can	OO
go	OO
back	OO
to	OO
that	OO
idea	OO
of	OO
synthetic	OO
biology	OO
and	OO
tweak	OO
'em	OO
around	?O
so	OU
here	OO
is	OO
one	OO
of	OO
our	OO
favorite	OO
places	OO
in	OO
yellowstone	OU
national	OU
park	.U
this	OU
is	OO
octopus	OU
springs	.U
if	OU
you	OO
tilt	OO
your	OO
head	OO
a	OO
little	OO
bit	,O
it	OO
sort	OO
of	OO
looks	OO
like	OO
a	OO
body	OO
and	OO
tentacles	OO
coming	OO
out	.O
it's	OU
above	OO
the	OO
boiling	OO
temperature	OO
of	OO
water	.O
those	OU
organisms	OO
that	OO
you	OO
see	OO
on	OO
the	OO
edge	OO
and	OO
the	OO
colors	OO
actually	OO
match	OO
the	OO
temperatures	OO
that	OO
are	OO
there	,O
very	,O
very	OO
high	OO
temperature	OO
thermophiles	.O
so	OU
why	OO
not	OO
take	OO
organisms	OO
that	OO
can	OO
live	OO
at	OO
extremes	,O
whether	OO
it's	OO
high	OO
temperature	OO
or	OO
low	OO
temperature	OO
or	OO
low	OO
ph	OO
or	OO
high	OO
ph	OO
or	OO
high	OO
salt	OO
or	OO
high	OO
levels	OO
of	OO
radiation	,O
and	OO
take	OO
some	OO
of	OO
those	OO
capabilities	OO
and	OO
put	OO
it	OO
into	OO
other	OO
organisms	.O
and	OU
this	OO
is	OO
a	OO
project	OO
that	OO
my	OO
students	OO
have	OO
called	,O
and	OO
i	OU
love	OO
this	,O
the	OO
hell	OO
cell	.O
and	OU
so	OO
we've	OO
done	OO
that	.O
we've	OU
taken	OO
organisms	OO
and	OO
sort	OO
of	OO
tweaked	OO
them	OO
and	OO
pushed	OO
them	OO
to	OO
the	OO
edges	.O
and	OU
this	OO
is	OO
important	OO
for	OO
getting	OO
us	OO
off	OO
planet	OO
and	OO
also	OO
for	OO
understanding	OO
what	OO
life	OO
is	OO
like	OO
in	OO
the	OO
universe	.O
so	OU
let	OO
me	OO
give	OO
you	OO
just	OO
a	OO
couple	OO
of	OO
final	OO
thoughts	.O
first	OU
is	OO
this	OO
whole	OO
idea	OO
that	OO
we	OO
have	OO
all	OO
these	OO
needs	OO
for	OO
human	OO
settlement	OO
off	OO
planet	OO
that	OO
are	OO
in	OO
some	OO
ways	OO
exactly	OO
like	OO
we	OO
have	OO
on	OO
the	OO
earth	,U
that	OO
we	OO
need	OO
the	OO
food	OO
and	OO
we	OO
need	OO
the	OO
shelter	OO
and	OO
so	OO
on	,O
but	OO
we	OO
have	OO
very	,O
very	OO
different	OO
constraints	OO
of	OO
this	OO
upmass	OO
problem	OO
and	OO
the	OO
reliability	OO
and	OO
the	OO
flexibility	OO
and	OO
so	OO
on	.O
but	OU
because	OO
we	OO
have	OO
these	OO
constraints	OO
that	OO
you	OO
don't	OO
have	OO
here	,O
where	OO
you	OO
might	OO
have	OO
to	OO
think	OO
about	OO
the	OO
indigenous	OO
petrochemical	OO
industry	,O
or	OO
whatever	,O
you	OO
now	OO
have	OO
constraints	OO
that	OO
have	OO
to	OO
unleash	OO
creativity	.O
and	OU
once	OO
you	OO
unleash	OO
this	OO
creativity	OO
because	OO
you	OO
have	OO
the	OO
new	OO
constraints	,O
you're	OO
forcing	OO
game	OO
changing	OO
technological	OO
advances	OO
that	OO
you	OO
wouldn't	OO
have	OO
gotten	OO
any	OO
other	OO
way	.O
finally	,U
we	OO
have	OO
to	OO
think	OO
a	OO
little	OO
bit	,O
is	OO
it	OO
a	OO
good	OO
idea	OO
to	OO
tinker	OO
around	OO
with	OO
life	?O
well	,U
the	OO
sort	OO
of	OO
easy	OO
answer	OO
to	OO
that	OO
is	OO
that	OO
probably	OO
no	OO
one	OO
in	OO
the	OO
room	OO
keeps	OO
a	OO
wolf	OO
cub	OO
at	OO
home	,O
but	OO
you	OO
might	OO
have	OO
a	OO
puppy	OO
or	OO
a	OO
dog;	OO
you	OO
probably	OO
didn't	OO
eat	OO
teosinte	OO
this	OO
summer	,O
but	OO
you	OO
ate	OO
corn	.O
we	OU
have	OO
been	OO
doing	OO
genetic	OO
modification	OO
with	OO
organisms	OO
for	OO
literally	OO
10,000	OO
or	OO
more	OO
years	.O
this	OU
is	OO
a	OO
different	OO
approach	,O
but	OO
to	OO
say	OO
all	OO
of	OO
a	OO
sudden	OO
humans	OO
should	OO
never	OO
touch	OO
an	OO
organism	OO
is	OO
kinda	OO
silly	OO
because	OO
we	OO
have	OO
that	OO
capability	OO
now	OO
to	OO
do	OO
things	OO
that	OO
are	OO
far	OO
more	OO
beneficial	OO
for	OO
the	OO
planet	OO
earth	OU
and	OO
for	OO
life	OO
beyond	OO
that	.O
and	OU
so	OO
then	OO
the	OO
question	OO
is	,O
should	OO
we	?O
and	OU
of	OO
course	OO
i	OU
feel	OO
that	OO
not	OO
only	OO
should	OO
we	,O
at	OO
least	OO
for	OO
getting	OO
off	OO
earth	,U
but	OO
actually	OO
if	OO
we	OO
don't	OO
use	OO
synthetic	OO
biology	,O
we	OO
will	OO
never	OO
solve	OO
this	OO
upmass	OO
problem	.O
so	OU
once	OO
you	OO
think	OO
of	OO
life	OO
as	OO
a	OO
technology	,O
you've	OO
got	OO
the	OO
solution	.O
and	OU
so	,O
with	OO
that	,O
i'd	OU
like	OO
to	OO
finish	OO
the	OO
way	OO
i	OU
always	OO
finish	,O
and	OO
say	OO

astrobiologists	OU

to	OO

until	OO

that	OO

the	OO

similarly	OU
to	OO

it	OO
likely	OO
contains	OO
an	OO
ocean	OO
deep	OO
under	OO
the	OO

enceladus	OU

geysers	OO
that	OO
frequently	OO

astrobiologists	OU

about	OO

to	OO
the	OO

they	OU
hope	OO
to	OO

whether	OO

what	OO

if	OU

astrobiologists	OO

for	OO
many	OO
reasons	.O
one	OU
of	OO
the	OO
biggest	OO
concerns	OO
is	OO
to	OO
make	OO
sure	OO
we	OO
sterilize	OO
our	OO

otherwise	OU
we	OO

which	OO

are	OO
just	OO
three	OO
of	OO
possibly	OO
many	OO
ocean	OO
worlds	OO
that	OO
we	OO
could	OO

we	OU

in	OO
our	OO

including	OO
jupiter’s	OU
moons	OO
callisto	OU
and	OO
ganymede	,U
neptune’s	OU
triton	,U
and	OO
even	OO
pluto	.U
if	OU
there’s	OO
this	OO
much	OO
potential	OO
for	OO
life	OO
to	OO
exist	OO
in	OO
our	OO
own	OO
tiny	OO
solar	OO
system	,O
what	OO
unimagined	OO
secrets	OO
might	OO
the	OO
rest	OO
of	OO
the	OO

contain	?O
do	OU
you	OO
think	OO
the	OO
things	OO
we	OO
build	OO
today	OO
will	OO
be	OO
considered	OO
wonders	OO
in	OO
the	OO
future	?O
think	OU
of	OO
stonehenge	,U
the	OO
pyramids	,U
machu	OU
picchu	OU
and	OO
easter	OU
island	.U
now	,U
they're	OO
all	OO
pretty	OO
different	OO
from	OO
what	OO
we're	OO
doing	OO
today	,O
with	OO
those	OO
massive	OO
stones	,O
assembled	OO
in	OO
complex	OO
but	OO
seemingly	OO
illogical	OO
ways	,O
and	OO
all	OO
traces	OO
of	OO
their	OO
construction	OO
erased	,O
shrouding	OO
them	OO
in	OO
mystery	.O
it	OU
seems	OO
like	OO
people	OO
could	OO
not	OO
have	OO
possibly	OO
built	OO
these	OO
things	,O
because	OO
people	OO
didn't	.O
they	OU
were	OO
carefully	OO
crafted	OO
by	OO
a	OO
primordial	OO
race	OO
of	OO
giants	OO
known	OO
as	OO
cyclops	.U
and	OU
i've	OU
been	OO
collaborating	OO
with	OO
these	OO
monsters	OO
to	OO
learn	OO
their	OO
secrets	OO
for	OO
moving	OO
those	OO
massive	OO
stones	.O
and	OU
as	OO
it	OO
turns	OO
out	,O
cyclops	OU
aren't	OO
even	OO
that	OO
strong	.O
they're	OU
just	OO
really	OO
smart	OO
about	OO
getting	OO
material	OO
to	OO
work	OO
for	OO
them	.O
now	,U
the	OO
videos	OO
you	OO
see	OO
behind	OO
me	OO
of	OO
large	,O
stone	OO
like	,O
wobbly	OO
creatures	OO
are	OO
the	OO
results	OO
of	OO
this	OO
collaboration	.O
ok	,U
so	OO
cyclops	OU
might	OO
be	OO
a	OO
mythical	OO
creature	,O
but	OO
those	OO
wonders	OO
are	OO
still	OO
real	.O
people	OU
made	OO
them	.O
but	OU
they	OO
also	OO
made	OO
the	OO
myths	OO
that	OO
surround	OO
them	,O
and	OO
when	OO
it	OO
comes	OO
to	OO
wonders	,O
there's	OO
this	OO
thick	OO
connective	OO
tissue	OO
between	OO
mythology	OO
and	OO
reality	.O
take	OU
easter	OU
island	,U
for	OO
example	.O
when	OU
the	OO
dutch	OU
explorers	OO
first	OO
encountered	OO
the	OO
island	,O
they	OO
asked	OO
the	OO
people	OO
of	OO
rapa	OU
nui	OU
how	OO
their	OO
ancestors	OO
could	OO
have	OO
possibly	OO
moved	OO
those	OO
massive	OO
statues	.O
and	OU
the	OO
rapa	OU
nui	OU
said	,O
our	OU
ancestors	OO
didn't	OO
move	OO
the	OO
statues	,O
because	OO
the	OO
statues	OO
walked	OO
themselves	.O
for	OU
centuries	,O
this	OO
was	OO
dismissed	,O
but	OO
actually	OO
it's	OO
true	.O
the	OU
statues	,O
known	OO
as	OO
moai	,O
were	OO
transported	OO
standing	,O
pivoting	OO
from	OO
side	OO
to	OO
side	.O
ok	?U
as	OU
spectacular	OO
as	OO
the	OO
moai	OO
are	OO
for	OO
visitors	OO
today	,O
you	OO
have	OO
to	OO
imagine	OO
being	OO
there	OO
then	,O
with	OO
colossal	OO
moai	OO
marching	OO
around	OO
the	OO
island	.O
because	OU
the	OO
real	OO
memorial	OO
was	OO
not	OO
the	OO
objects	OO
themselves	,O
it	OO
was	OO
the	OO
cultural	OO
ritual	OO
of	OO
bringing	OO
a	OO
stone	OO
to	OO
life	.O
so	OU
as	OO
an	OO
architect	,O
i've	OU
been	OO
chasing	OO
that	OO
dream	.O
how	OU
can	OO
we	OO
shift	OO
our	OO
idea	OO
of	OO
construction	OO
to	OO
accommodate	OO
that	OO
mythical	OO
side	?O
so	OU
what	OO
i've	OU
been	OO
doing	OO
is	OO
challenging	OO
myself	OO
with	OO
putting	OO
on	OO
a	OO
series	OO
of	OO
performances	OO
of	OO
the	OO
ancient	OO
but	OO
pretty	OO
straightforward	OO
task	OO
of	OO
just	OO
moving	OO
and	OO
standing	OO
big	OO
heavy	OO
objects	,O
like	OO
this	OO
16	OO
foot	OO
tall	OO
megalith	OO
designed	OO
to	OO
walk	OO
across	OO
land	OO
and	OO
stand	OO
vertically;	OO
or	OO
this	OO
4,000	OO
pound	OO
behemoth	OO
that	OO
springs	OO
itself	OO
to	OO
life	OO
to	OO
dance	OO
onstage	.O
and	OU
what	OO
i've	OU
found	OO
is	OO
that	OO
by	OO
thinking	OO
of	OO
architecture	OO
not	OO
as	OO
an	OO
end	OO
product	OO
but	OO
as	OO
a	OO
performance	OO
from	OO
conception	OO
to	OO
completion	,O
we	OO
end	OO
up	OO
rediscovering	OO
some	OO
really	OO
smart	OO
ways	OO
to	OO
build	OO
things	OO
today	.O
you	OU
know	,O
so	OO
much	OO
of	OO
the	OO
discussion	OO
surrounding	OO
our	OO
future	OO
focuses	OO
on	OO
technology	,O
efficiency	OO
and	OO
speed	.O
but	OU
if	OO
i've	OU
learned	OO
anything	OO
from	OO
cyclops	,U
it's	OO
that	OO
wonders	OO
can	OO
be	OO
smart	,O
spectacular	OO
and	OO
sustainable	OO
—	OO
because	OO
of	OO
their	OO
mass	OO
and	OO
their	OO
mystery	.O
and	OU
while	OO
people	OO
still	OO
want	OO
to	OO
know	OO
how	OO
those	OO
ancient	OO
wonders	OO
were	OO
built	,O
i've	OU
been	OO
asking	OO
cyclops	OU
how	OO
to	OO
create	OO
the	OO
mystery	OO
that	OO
compels	OO
people	OO
to	OO
ask	OO
that	OO
very	OO
question	.O
because	OU
in	OO
an	OO
era	OO
where	OO
we	OO
design	OO
buildings	OO
to	OO
last	OO
30	,O
maybe	OO
60	OO
years	,O
i	OU
would	OO
love	OO
to	OO
learn	OO
how	OO
to	OO
create	OO
something	OO
that	OO
could	OO
entertain	OO
for	OO
an	OO

you	.O
i	OU

a	OO

kaveh	OU

a	OO

kaveh	OU

that	OO

which	OO

how	OO
they	OO

to	OO

that	OO
the	OO

big	OO
enough	OO
that	OO
a	OO

with	OO
the	OO

there	OU

these	OO

that	OO

they	OO
fly	OO
in	OO
what's	OO

a	OO

a	OO

someone	OO

these	OO

at	OO

it's	OO
just	OO
an	OO

then	OO
there's	OO
a	OO
moment	OO
where	OO
the	OO

shift	,O

they	OO
form	OO
the	OO

it's	OO

my	OO

to	OO

his	OO

hamlet’s	OU
madness	OO
part	OO
of	OO
a	OO
performance	OO
to	OO

watching	OO
a	OO

these	OU
questions	OO
weigh	OO
heavily	OO
on	OO
hamlet’s	OU

and	OU
since	OO
he	OO

much	OO
of	OO
the	OO

to	OO

overlooked	OO
throughout	OO

sometimes	,U
these	OO

blindness–	OO
such	OO
as	OO
when	OO

at	OU

these	OU
moments	OO
leave	OO
us	OO
with	OO
the	OO

knowledge	OO
that	OO

evolves	OO
from	OO

error–	OO
even	OO
if	OO

the	OO
one	OO

back	OO

an	OO

that	OO
i	OU

that	OO

some	OO

and	OU
this	OO
issue	,O
as	OO
was	OO
stated	OO
in	OO
the	OO

was	OO
something	OO
towards	OO

and	OO
how	OO
i	OU
was	OO
not	OO
immunized	OO
against	OO
various	OO

as	OO

hepatitis	OO
—	OO
the	OO
standard	OO
vaccine	OO
someone	OO
my	OO

now	,U
this	OO
question	OO
i	OU
asked	OO
was	OO
simple	OO
and	OO
pretty	OO
strange	,O
because	,O
you	OO
know	,O
i	OU
wanted	OO
to	OO
get	OO
vaccinated	.O
that's	OU
kind	OO
of	OO
weird	,O
but	OO
it	OO
happened	,O
and	OO
then	OO
this	OO
turned	OO
into	OO
a	OO
public	OO
story	,O
because	OO
i	OU
wanted	OO
to	OO
get	OO
vaccinated	.O
so	OU
that	OO
was	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
strange	,O
and	OO
then	OO
it	OO
blew	OO
up	OO
more	,O
and	OO
i	OU
was	OO
doing	OO
interviews	OO
and	OO
talking	OO
to	OO
more	OO
people	,O
and	OO
again	,O
i'm	OU
a	OO
normal	OO

i'm	OU
not	OO
a	OO

i	OU
don't	OO
lead	OO
a	OO

i	OU
am	OO
a	OO
pretty	OO
casual	OO
person	,O
i'm	OU
wearing	OO
a	OO

because	OU
of	OO
this	OO
question	OO
and	OO
this	OO
story	,O
because	OO
i	OU
wanted	OO
to	OO
get	OO
vaccinated	OO
and	OO
this	OO
interesting	OO
situation	OO
i	OU
was	OO
in	,O
i	OU
saw	OO
that	OO
i	OU
quickly	OO
was	OO
in	OO
this	OO
public	OO
setting	OO
of	OO
an	OO
extremely	OO
important	OO
controversy	OO
and	OO
discussion	OO
taking	OO

now	,U
i	OU
saw	OO
that	OO
the	OO

and	OO

were	OO
pretty	OO
accurate	OO
for	OO
most	OO

you	OO

after	OU
defying	OO

ohio	OU
teen	OO

why	OO
he	OO

pretty	OU
accurate	,O
pretty	OO
true	.O
and	,U
as	OO
stated	,O
i	OU
testified	OO
in	OO
front	OO
of	OO
a	OO

so	OO
there	,O
they	OO
said	,O
this	OU

who	OO

just	OO

his	OO

ok	,U
i	OU
didn't	OO
really	OO
do	OO
that	,O

that's	OO
fine	.O
and	OU
certain	OO

it	OO
a	OO

further	.O
'god	OO

how	OO

teenager	,U

so	OU
i	OU

not	OO

my	OO

that's	OO
not	OO

at	OO

and	OU
you	OO

my	OO

about	OO

it	OU

about	OO

i	OU

and	OO
even	OO
in	OO
public	OO
settings	OO
where	OO
i	OU
expressed	OO
how	OO
her	OO
beliefs	OO
were	OO
misinformed	,O
i	OU
said	OO
that	OO
she	OO
was	OO
a	OO
loving	OO
mother	,O
and	OO
that's	OO
important	OO
to	OO
understand	.O
because	OU
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
people	,O
i	OU
think	,O
in	OO
the	OO
scientific	OO
community	OO
that	OO
understand	OO
why	OO
vaccines	OO
are	OO
so	OO
important	,O
can	OO
really	OO
be	OO
confused	OO
by	OO
someone	OO
who	OO
would	OO
not	OO
vaccinate	.O
really	,U
we	OO
can	OO
compare	OO
it	OO
to	OO
someone	OO
not	OO
taking	OO
their	OO
child	OO
to	OO
the	OO
er	.U
that's	OU
a	OO
very	OO
dangerous	OO
situation	OO
to	OO
be	OO
in	OO
and	OO
it	OO
shows	OO
some	OO
lack	OO
of	OO
empathy	OO
towards	OO
your	OO
children	OO
in	OO
some	OO
regards	.O
and	OU
really	,O
i	OU
can	OO
understand	OO
that	,O
i	OU
can	.O
but	OU
my	OO
mom	,O
she	OO
was	OO
misinformed	OO
and	OO
misled	OO
by	OO
sources	OO
that	OO
convinced	OO
her	OO
that	OO
if	OO
she	OO
was	OO
a	OO
loving	OO
parent	,O
she	OO
wouldn't	OO
vaccinate	.O
now	,U
when	OO
i	OU
encountered	OO
this	OO
and	OO
i	OU
talked	OO
to	OO
my	OO
mom	,O
it	OO
didn't	OO
obviously	OO
go	OO
well	OO
at	OO
first	,O
because	OO
i	OU
was	OO
wanting	OO
to	OO
do	OO
something	OO
that	OO
she	OO
thought	OO
would	OO
either	OO
cause	OO
autism	OO
or	OO
maim	OO
me	OO
for	OO
the	OO
rest	OO
of	OO
my	OO
life	,O
and	OO
i	OU
said	OO
i	OU
wanted	OO
to	OO
do	OO
this	OO
—	OO
didn't	OO
really	OO
fly	,O
didn't	OO
really	OO
go	OO
well	.O
but	OU
the	OO
thing	OO
that	OO
i	OU
found	OO
interesting	OO
was	OO
that	OO
when	OO
i	OU
had	OO
started	OO
to	OO
get	OO
into	OO
this	OO
circumstance	,O
do	OO
these	OO
interviews	,O
there	OO
was	OO
one	OO
question	OO
i	OU
proposed	.O
wasn't	OU
a	OO
positive	OO
one:	OO
what	OU
in	OO
the	OO
world	OO
have	OO
i	OU
gotten	OO
myself	OO
into	?O
that's	OU
what	OO
i	OU
asked	OO
constantly	,O
because	,O
again	,O
i	OU
am	OO
not	OO
an	OO
expert	,O
i	OU
am	OO
a	OO
normal	OO
kid	,O
and	OO
now	OO
i'm	OU
talking	OO
to	OO
cnn	OU
and	OO
fox	OU
news	OU
about	OO
a	OO
scientific	OO
discussion	OO
that	OO
really	,O
should	OO
i	OU
be	OO
facilitating	,O
should	OO
i	OU
be	OO
commenting	OO
on	?O
and	OU
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
people	OO
questioned	OO
that	,O
and	OO
for	OO
good	OO
reason	.O
but	OU
i	OU
never	OO
claimed	OO
things	OO
i	OU
didn't	OO
understand	,O
i	OU
talked	OO
about	OO
my	OO
personal	OO
experiences	.O

even	OO
at	OO
the	OO

i	OU
just	OO
talked	OO
about	OO
how	OO

dangerous	.O
my	OU

a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
her	OO

from	OO

from	OO

from	OO

that	OO

that	OO

very	OO
dangerous	.O
now	,U
i	OU
also	OO

that	OO

i	OU

i	OU

doing	OO
this	OO

as	OO

i	OU

a	OO

when	OU

the	OO

that	OO

so	OU
really	,O
for	OO

for	OO
most	OO

most	OO
people	,O
when	OO

it	OO

that	OO

that's	OO

to	OO

the	OO

the	OO

the	OO

people	OU
resonate	OO
with	OO

and	OU
you	OO
have	OO
to	OO

you're	OO

to	OO
the	OO

to	OO

to	OO
an	OO

i	OU

outside	OO
of:	OO
people	OO

that's	OO

that	OO
children	OO

that's	OO

and	OU
that	OO
we're	OO
having	OO
disease	OO

that	OO

here	.O
and	OU
i	OU
believe	,O
as	OO
john	OU

put	OO
it	,O
these	OO
diseases	OO
should	OO
be	OO
in	OO
history	OO
books	OO
and	OO
not	OO
in	OO
our	OO
communities	.O
so	OU
because	OO
of	OO
that	,O
you	OO
need	OO
to	OO
make	OO
a	OO
personal	OO
decision	OO
to	OO
stand	OO

you	OU

to	OO

this	OU

accurate	,O
this	OO
is	OO
what's	OO
real	,O
and	OO
these	OO
lies	OO
are	OO
not	OO
ok	.U
because	OU
it	OO
started	OO
with	OO
me	OO
doing	OO
that	OO
on	OO
a	OO
personal	OO
level	.O
i	OU
wasn't	OO
going	OO
from	OO
small	OO
town	OO
to	OO
senate	OU
in	OO
a	OO
day	.O
it	OU
wasn't	OO
like	,O
i	OU
go	OO
to	OO
bed	,O
i	OU
wake	OO
up	OO
and	OO
there's	OO
senator	OU
isakson	,U
asking	OO
me	OO
questions	OO
about	OO
vaccines	.O
it	OU
was	OO
a	OO
slow	OO
progression	OO
and	OO
it	OO
started	OO
with	OO
me	OO
saying	,O
this	OU
is	OO
true	,O
my	OO
mom	OO
doesn't	OO
believe	OO
it	,O
but	OO
that's	OO
ok	.U
because	OU
that	OO
doesn't	OO
change	OO
the	OO
truth	,O
doesn't	OO
change	OO
what's	OO
accurate	OO
and	OO
what's	OO
important	.O
and	OU
honestly	,O
the	OO
biggest	OO
thing	,O
this	OO
whole	OO
idea	OO
of	OO
unbreakable:	OO
remain	OO
unbroken	.O
when	OU
you	OO
stand	OO
up	OO
for	OO
what's	OO
true	OO
and	OO
you	OO
have	OO
that	OO
criticism	,O
and	OO
you're	OO
trying	OO
to	OO
cause	OO
a	OO
movement	,O
don't	OO
sway	.O
thank	OU
you	.O
so	,U
asking	OO
for	OO
help	OO
is	OO
basically	OO
the	OO
worst	,O
right	?O
i've	OU
actually	OO
never	OO
seen	OO
it	OO
on	OO
one	OO
of	OO
those	OO
top	OO
ten	OO
lists	OO
of	OO
things	OO
people	OO
fear	,O
like	OO
public	OO
speaking	OO
and	OO
death	,O
but	OO
i'm	OU
pretty	OO
sure	OO
it	OO
actually	OO
belongs	OO
there	.O
even	OU
though	OO
in	OO
many	OO
ways	OO
it's	OO
foolish	OO
for	OO
us	OO
to	OO
be	OO
afraid	OO
to	OO
admit	OO
we	OO
need	OO
help	,O
whether	OO
it's	OO
from	OO
a	OO
loved	OO
one	OO
or	OO
a	OO
friend	OO
or	OO
from	OO
a	OO
coworker	OO
or	OO
even	OO
from	OO
a	OO
stranger	,O
somehow	OO
it	OO
always	OO
feel	OO
just	OO
a	OO
little	OO
bit	OO
uncomfortable	OO
and	OO
embarrassing	OO
to	OO
actually	OO
ask	OO
for	OO
help	,O
which	OO
is	,O
of	OO
course	,O
why	OO
most	OO
of	OO
us	OO
try	OO
to	OO
avoid	OO
asking	OO
for	OO
help	OO
whenever	OO
humanly	OO
possible	.O
my	OU
father	OO
was	OO
one	OO
of	OO
those	OO
legions	OO
of	OO
fathers	OO
who	,O
i	OU
swear	,O
would	OO
rather	OO
drive	OO
through	OO
an	OO
alligator	OO
infested	OO
swamp	OO
than	OO
actually	OO
ask	OO
someone	OO
for	OO
help	OO
getting	OO
back	OO
to	OO
the	OO
road	.O
when	OU
i	OU
was	OO
a	OO
kid	,O
we	OO
took	OO
a	OO
family	OO
vacation	.O
we	OU
drove	OO
from	OO
our	OO
home	OO
in	OO
south	OU
jersey	OU
to	OO
colonial	OU
williamsburg	.U
and	OU
i	OU
remember	OO
we	OO
got	OO
really	OO
badly	OO
lost	.O
my	OU
mother	OO
and	OO
i	OU
pleaded	OO
with	OO
him	OO
to	OO
please	OO
just	OO
pull	OO
over	OO
and	OO
ask	OO
someone	OO
for	OO
directions	OO
back	OO
to	OO
the	OO
highway	,O
and	OO
he	OO
absolutely	OO
refused	,O
and	,O
in	OO
fact	,O
assured	OO
us	OO
that	OO
we	OO
were	OO
not	OO
lost	,O
he	OO
had	OO
just	OO
always	OO
wanted	OO
to	OO
know	OO
what	OO
was	OO
over	OO
here	.O
so	OU
if	OO
we're	OO
going	OO
to	OO
ask	OO
for	OO
help	OO
—	OO
and	OO
we	OO
have	OO
to	,O
we	OO
all	OO
do	,O
practically	OO
every	OO
day	OO
—	OO
the	OO
only	OO
way	OO
we're	OO
going	OO
to	OO
even	OO
begin	OO
to	OO
get	OO
comfortable	OO
with	OO
it	OO
is	OO
to	OO
get	OO
good	OO
at	OO
it	,O
to	OO
actually	OO
increase	OO
the	OO
chances	OO
that	OO
when	OO
you	OO
ask	OO
for	OO
help	OO
from	OO
someone	,O
they're	OO
actually	OO
going	OO
to	OO
say	OO
yes	.O
and	OU
not	OO
only	OO
that	,O
but	OO
they're	OO
going	OO
to	OO
find	OO
it	OO
actually	OO
satisfying	OO
and	OO
rewarding	OO
to	OO
help	OO
you	,O
because	OO
that	OO
way	,O
they'll	OO
be	OO
motivated	OO
to	OO
continue	OO
to	OO
help	OO
you	OO
into	OO
the	OO
future	.O
so	OU
research	OO
that	OO
i	OU
and	OO
some	OO
of	OO
my	OO
colleagues	OO
have	OO
done	OO
has	OO
shed	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
light	OO
on	OO
why	OO
it	OO
is	OO
that	OO
sometimes	OO
people	OO
say	OO
yes	OO
to	OO
our	OO
requests	OO
for	OO
help	OO
and	OO
why	OO
sometimes	OO
they	OO
say	OO
no	.O
now	OU
let	OO
me	OO
just	OO
start	OO
by	OO
saying	OO
right	OO
now:	OO
if	OO
you	OO
need	OO
help	,O
you	OO
are	OO
going	OO
to	OO
have	OO
to	OO
ask	OO
for	OO
it	.O
out	OU
loud	.O
ok	?U
we	OU
all	,O
to	OO
some	OO
extent	,O
suffer	OO
from	OO
something	OO
that	OO
psychologists	OO
call	OO
the	OO
illusion	OO
of	OO
transparency	OO
—	OO
basically	,O
the	OO
mistaken	OO
belief	OO
that	OO
our	OO
thoughts	OO
and	OO
our	OO
feelings	OO
and	OO
our	OO
needs	OO
are	OO
really	OO
obvious	OO
to	OO
other	OO
people	.O
this	OU
is	OO
not	OO
true	,O
but	OO
we	OO
believe	OO
it	.O
and	OU
so	,O
we	OO
just	OO
mostly	OO
stand	OO
around	OO
waiting	OO
for	OO
someone	OO
to	OO
notice	OO
our	OO
needs	OO
and	OO
then	OO
spontaneously	OO
offer	OO
to	OO
help	OO
us	OO
with	OO
it	.O
this	OU
is	OO
a	OO
really	,O
really	OO
bad	OO
assumption	.O
in	OU
fact	,O
not	OO
only	OO
is	OO
it	OO
very	OO
difficult	OO
to	OO
tell	OO
what	OO
your	OO
needs	OO
are	,O
but	OO
even	OO
the	OO
people	OO
close	OO
to	OO
you	OO
often	OO
struggle	OO
to	OO
understand	OO
how	OO
they	OO
can	OO
support	OO
you	.O
my	OU
partner	OO
has	OO
actually	OO
had	OO
to	OO
adopt	OO
a	OO
habit	OO
of	OO
asking	OO
me	OO
multiple	OO
times	OO
a	OO
day	,O
are	OU
you	OO
ok	?U
do	OU
you	OO
need	OO
anything	?O
because	OO
i	OU
am	OO
so	,O
so	OO
bad	OO
at	OO
signaling	OO
when	OO
i	OU
need	OO
someone's	OO
help	.O
now	,U
he	OO
is	OO
more	OO
patient	OO
than	OO
i	OU
deserve	OO
and	OO
much	OO
more	OO
proactive	,O
much	OO
more	,O
about	OO
helping	OO
than	OO
any	OO
of	OO
us	OO
have	OO
any	OO
right	OO
to	OO
expect	OO
other	OO
people	OO
to	OO
be	.O
so	OU
if	OO
you	OO
need	OO
help	,O
you're	OO
going	OO
to	OO
have	OO
to	OO
ask	OO
for	OO
it	.O
and	OU
by	OO
the	OO
way	,O
even	OO
when	OO
someone	OO
can	OO
tell	OO
that	OO
you	OO
need	OO
help	,O
how	OO
do	OO
they	OO
know	OO
that	OO
you	OO
want	OO
it	?O
did	OU
you	OO
ever	OO
try	OO
to	OO
give	OO
unsolicited	OO
help	OO
to	OO
someone	OO
who	,O
it	OO
turns	OO
out	,O
did	OO
not	OO
actually	OO
want	OO
your	OO
help	OO
in	OO
the	OO
first	OO
place	?O
they	OU
get	OO
nasty	OO
real	OO
quick	,O
don't	OO
they	?O
the	OU
other	OO
day	OO
—	OO
true	OO
story	OO
—	OO
my	OO
teenage	OO
daughter	OO
was	OO
getting	OO
dressed	OO
for	OO
school	,O
and	OO
i	OU
decided	OO
to	OO
give	OO
her	OO
some	OO
unsolicited	OO
help	OO
about	OO
that	.O
i	OU
happen	OO
to	OO
think	OO
she	OO
looks	OO
amazing	OO
in	OO
brighter	OO
colors	.O
she	OU
tends	OO
to	OO
prefer	OO
sort	OO
of	OO
darker	,O
more	OO
neutral	OO
tones	.O
and	OU
so	OO
i	OU
said	,O
very	OO
helpfully	,O
that	OO
i	OU
thought	OO
maybe	OO
she	OO
could	OO
go	OO
back	OO
upstairs	OO
and	OO
try	OO
to	OO
find	OO
something	OO
a	OO
little	OO
less	OO
somber	.O
so	,U
if	OO
looks	OO
could	OO
kill	,O
i	OU
would	OO
not	OO
be	OO
standing	OO
here	OO
right	OO
now	.O
we	OU
really	OO
can't	OO
blame	OO
other	OO
people	OO
for	OO
not	OO
just	OO
spontaneously	OO
offering	OO
to	OO
help	OO
us	OO
when	OO
we	OO
don't	OO
actually	OO
know	OO
that	OO
that's	OO
what	OO
is	OO
wanted	.O
in	OU
fact	,O
actually	,O
research	OO
shows	OO
that	OO
90	OO
percent	OO
of	OO
the	OO
help	OO
that	OO
coworkers	OO
give	OO
one	OO
another	OO
in	OO
the	OO
workplace	OO
is	OO
in	OO
response	OO
to	OO
explicit	OO
requests	OO
for	OO
help	.O
so	OU
you're	OO
going	OO
to	OO
have	OO
to	OO
say	OO
the	OO
words	OO
i	OU
need	OO
your	OO
help	.O
right	?U
there's	OU
no	OO
getting	OO
around	OO
it	.O
now	,U
to	OO
be	OO
good	OO
at	OO
it	,O
to	OO
make	OO
sure	OO
that	OO
people	OO
actually	OO
do	OO
help	OO
you	OO
when	OO
you	OO
ask	OO
for	OO
it	,O
there	OO
are	OO
a	OO
few	OO
other	OO
things	OO
that	OO
are	OO
very	OO
helpful	OO
to	OO
keep	OO
in	OO
mind	.O
first	OU
thing:	OO
when	OO
you	OO
ask	OO
for	OO
help	,O
be	OO
very	,O
very	OO
specific	OO
about	OO
the	OO
help	OO
you	OO
want	OO
and	OO
why	.O
vague	,U
sort	OO
of	OO
indirect	OO
requests	OO
for	OO
help	OO
actually	OO
aren't	OO
very	OO
helpful	OO
to	OO
the	OO
helper	,O
right	?O
we	OU
don't	OO
actually	OO
know	OO
what	OO
it	OO
is	OO
you	OO
want	OO
from	OO
us	,O
and	,O
just	OO
as	OO
important	,O
we	OO
don't	OO
know	OO
whether	OO
or	OO
not	OO
we	OO
can	OO
be	OO
successful	OO
in	OO
giving	OO
you	OO
the	OO
help	.O
nobody	OU
wants	OO
to	OO
give	OO
bad	OO
help	.O
like	OU
me	,O
you	OO
probably	OO
get	OO
some	OO
of	OO
these	OO
requests	OO
from	OO
perfectly	OO
pleasant	OO
strangers	OO
on	OO
linkedin	OU
who	OO
want	OO
to	OO
do	OO
things	OO
like	OO
get	OO
together	OO
over	OO
coffee	OO
and	OO
connect	OO
or	OO
pick	OO
your	OO
brain	.O
i	OU
ignore	OO
these	OO
requests	OO
literally	OO
every	OO
time	.O
and	OU
it's	OO
not	OO
that	OO
i'm	OU
not	OO
a	OO
nice	OO
person	.O
it's	OU
just	OO
that	OO
when	OO
i	OU
don't	OO
know	OO
what	OO
it	OO
is	OO
you	OO
want	OO
from	OO
me	,O
like	OO
the	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
help	OO
you're	OO
hoping	OO
that	OO
can	OO
i	OU
provide	,O
i'm	OU
not	OO
interested	.O
nobody	OU
is	.O
i'd	OU
have	OO
been	OO
much	OO
more	OO
interested	OO
if	OO
they	OO
had	OO
just	OO
come	OO
out	OO
and	OO
said	OO
whatever	OO
it	OO
is	OO
was	OO
they	OO
were	OO
hoping	OO
to	OO
get	OO
from	OO
me	,O
because	OO
i'm	OU
pretty	OO
sure	OO
they	OO
had	OO
something	OO
specific	OO
in	OO
mind	.O
so	OU
go	OO
ahead	OO
and	OO
say	,O
i'm	OU
hoping	OO
to	OO
discuss	OO
opportunities	OO
to	OO
work	OO
in	OO
your	OO
company	,O
or	,O
i'd	OU

to	OO

a	OO

in	OO
an	OO

i	OU

you're	OO

in	,O
or	,O
i'd	OU
like	OO
your	OO
advice	OO
on	OO
getting	OO
into	OO
medical	OO
school	.O
technically	,U
i	OU
can't	OO
help	OO
you	OO
with	OO
that	OO
last	OO
one	OO
because	OO
i'm	OU
not	OO
that	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
doctor	,O
but	OO
i	OU
could	OO
point	OO
you	OO
in	OO
the	OO
direction	OO
of	OO
someone	OO
who	OO
could	.O
ok	,U
second	OO
tip	.O
this	OU
is	OO
really	OO
important:	OO
please	OO
avoid	OO
disclaimers	,O
apologies	OO
and	OO
bribes	.O
really	,U
really	OO
important	.O
do	OU
any	OO
of	OO
these	OO
sound	OO
familiar	?O
'i'm	OO
so	,O
so	OO
sorry	OO
that	OO
i	OU
have	OO
to	OO
ask	OO
you	OO
for	OO
this	.O
i	OU
really	OO
hate	OO
bothering	OO
you	OO
with	OO
this	.O
if	OU
i	OU
had	OO
any	OO
way	OO
of	OO
doing	OO
this	OO
without	OO
your	OO
help	,O
i	OU
would	.O
sometimes	OU
it	OO
feels	OO
like	OO
people	OO
are	OO
so	OO
eager	OO
to	OO
prove	OO
that	OO
they're	OO
not	OO
weak	OO
and	OO
greedy	OO
when	OO
they	OO
ask	OO
your	OO
for	OO
help	,O
they're	OO
completely	OO
missing	OO
out	OO
on	OO
how	OO
uncomfortable	OO
they're	OO
making	OO
you	OO
feel	.O
and	OU
by	OO
the	OO
way	OO
—	OO
how	OO
am	OO
i	OU
supposed	OO
to	OO
find	OO
it	OO
satisfying	OO
to	OO
help	OO
you	OO
if	OO
you	OO
really	OO
hated	OO
having	OO
to	OO
ask	OO
me	OO
for	OO
help	?O
and	OU
while	OO
it	OO
is	OO
perfectly	,O
perfectly	OO
acceptable	OO
to	OO
pay	OO
strangers	OO
to	OO
do	OO
things	OO
for	OO
you	,O
you	OO
need	OO
to	OO
be	OO
very	,O
very	OO
careful	OO
when	OO
it	OO
comes	OO
to	OO
incentivizing	OO
your	OO
friends	OO
and	OO
coworkers	.O
when	OU
you	OO
have	OO
a	OO
relationship	OO
with	OO
someone	,O
helping	OO
one	OO
another	OO
is	OO
actually	OO
a	OO
natural	OO
part	OO
of	OO
that	OO
relationship	.O
it's	OU
how	OO
we	OO
show	OO
one	OO
another	OO
that	OO
we	OO
care	.O
if	OU
you	OO
introduce	OO
incentives	OO
or	OO
payments	OO
into	OO
that	,O
what	OO
can	OO
happen	OO
is	,O
it	OO
starts	OO
to	OO
feel	OO
like	OO
it	OO
isn't	OO
a	OO
relationship	,O
it's	OO
a	OO
transaction	.O
and	OU
that	OO
actually	OO
is	OO
experienced	OO
as	OO
distancing	,O
which	,O
ironically	,O
makes	OO
people	OO
less	OO
likely	OO
to	OO
help	OO
you	.O
so	OU
a	OO
spontaneous	OO
gift	OO
after	OO
someone	OO
gives	OO
you	OO
some	OO
help	OO
to	OO
show	OO
your	OO
appreciation	OO
and	OO
gratitude	OO
—	OO
perfectly	OO
fine	.O
an	OU
offer	OO
to	OO
pay	OO
your	OO
best	OO
friend	OO
to	OO
help	OO
you	OO
move	OO
into	OO
your	OO
new	OO
apartment	OO
is	OO
not	.O
ok	,U
third	OO
rule	,O
and	OO
i	OU
really	OO
mean	OO
this	OO
one:	OO
please	OO
do	OO
not	OO
ask	OO
for	OO
help	OO
over	OO
email	OO
or	OO
text	.O
really	,U
seriously	,O
please	OO
don't	.O
email	OU
and	OO
text	OO
are	OO
impersonal	.O
i	OU
realize	OO
sometimes	OO
there's	OO
no	OO
alternative	,O
but	OO
mostly	OO
what	OO
happens	OO
is	,O
we	OO
like	OO
to	OO
ask	OO
for	OO
help	OO
over	OO
email	OO
and	OO
text	OO
because	OO
it	OO
feels	OO
less	OO
awkward	OO
for	OO
us	OO
to	OO
do	OO
so	.O
you	OU
know	OO
what	OO
else	OO
feels	OO
less	OO
awkward	OO
over	OO
email	OO
and	OO
text	?O
telling	OU
you	OO
no	.O
and	OU
it	OO
turns	OO
out	,O
there's	OO
research	OO
to	OO
support	OO
this	.O
in	OU
person	OO
requests	OO
for	OO
help	OO
are	OO
30	OO
times	OO
more	OO
likely	OO
to	OO
get	OO
a	OO
yes	OO
than	OO
a	OO
request	OO
made	OO
by	OO
email	.O
so	OU
when	OO
something	OO
is	OO
really	OO
important	OO
and	OO
you	OO
really	OO
need	OO
someone's	OO
help	,O
make	OO
face	OO
time	OO
to	OO
make	OO
the	OO
request	,O
or	OO
use	OO
your	OO
phone	OO
as	OO
a	OO
phone	OO
—	OO
to	OO
ask	OO
for	OO
the	OO
help	OO
that	OO
you	OO
need	.O
ok	.U
last	OU
one	,O
and	OO
this	OO
is	OO
actually	OO
a	OO
really	,O
really	OO
important	OO
one	OO
and	OO
probably	OO
the	OO
one	OO
that	OO
is	OO
most	OO
overlooked	OO
when	OO
it	OO
comes	OO
to	OO
asking	OO
for	OO
help:	OO
when	OO
you	OO
ask	OO
someone	OO
for	OO
their	OO
help	OO
and	OO
they	OO
say	OO
yes	,O
follow	OO
up	OO
with	OO
them	OO
afterward	.O
there's	OU
a	OO
common	OO
misconception	OO
that	OO
what's	OO
rewarding	OO
about	OO
helping	OO
is	OO
the	OO
act	OO
of	OO
helping	OO
itself	.O
this	OU
is	OO
not	OO
true	.O
what	OU
is	OO
rewarding	OO
about	OO
helping	OO
is	OO
knowing	OO
that	OO
your	OO
help	OO
landed	,O
that	OO
it	OO
had	OO

that	OO
you	OO
were	OO

this	OO

of	OO
why	OO

of	OO

—	OO
because	OO

to	OO

that	OO

that	OO

the	OU

i	OU
know	OO
—	OO
that	OO
it	OO
is	OO
not	OO

we	OU
are	OO
all	OO
a	OO
little	OO

afraid	OO
to	OO
do	OO
it	.O
it	OU
makes	OO
us	OO

the	OO
reality	OO
of	OO

that	OO
nobody	OO

it	OO
alone	.O
nobody	OU

out	OO

when	OO
you	OO

that	OO

we've	OO
all	OO
felt	OO
this	OO

or	,U
at	OO

i	OU

i	OU
wrote	OO

a	OO
moment	OO
in	OO

was	OO

i	OU
had	OO
just	OO
moved	OO
to	OO

and	OO
started	OO
my	OO

at	OO

i	OU
was	OO

very	OO
much	OO
like	OO
i	OU
didn't	OO
belong	.O
but	OU
i	OU
had	OO
a	OO
lifeline	OO
of	OO
sorts	.O
see	,U
i	OU
was	OO
writing	OO
jokes	OO
for	OO
years	OO
and	OO
years	OO
and	OO
sharing	OO
them	OO
on	OO
social	OO

and	OO
i	OU
found	OO
that	OO
i	OU
was	OO
turning	OO
to	OO
doing	OO
this	OO
more	OO
and	OO
more	.O
now	,U
for	OO
many	OO
people	,O
the	OO
internet	OO
can	OO
feel	OO
like	OO
a	OO
lonely	OO
place	.O
it	OU
can	OO
feel	OO
like	OO
this	,O
a	OO
big	,O
endless	,O
expansive	OO
void	OO
where	OO
you	OO
can	OO
constantly	OO
call	OO
out	OO
to	OO
it	OO
but	OO
no	OO
one's	OO
ever	OO
listening	.O
but	OU
i	OU
actually	OO
found	OO
a	OO
comfort	OO
in	OO
speaking	OO
out	OO
to	OO
the	OO
void	.O
i	OU
found	,O
in	OO
sharing	OO
my	OO
feelings	OO
with	OO
the	OO
void	,O
eventually	OO
the	OO
void	OO
started	OO
to	OO
speak	OO
back	.O
and	OU
it	OO
turns	OO
out	OO
that	OO
the	OO
void	OO
isn't	OO
this	OO
endless	OO
lonely	OO
expanse	OO
at	OO
all	,O
but	OO
instead	OO
it's	OO
full	OO
of	OO
all	OO
sorts	OO
of	OO
other	OO
people	,O
also	OO
staring	OO
out	OO
into	OO
it	OO
and	OO
also	OO
wanting	OO
to	OO
be	OO
heard	.O
now	,U
there	OO
have	OO
been	OO
many	OO
bad	OO
things	OO
that	OO
have	OO
come	OO
from	OO
social	OO
media	.O
i'm	OU
not	OO
trying	OO
to	OO
dispute	OO
that	OO
at	OO
all	.O
to	OU
be	OO
online	OO
at	OO
any	OO
given	OO
point	OO
is	OO
to	OO
feel	OO
so	OO
much	OO
sadness	OO
and	OO
anger	OO
and	OO
violence	.O
it	OU
can	OO
feel	OO
like	OO
the	OO
end	OO
of	OO
the	OO
world	.O
yet	,U
at	OO
the	OO
same	OO
time	,O
i'm	OU
conflicted	OO
because	OO
i	OU
can't	OO
deny	OO
the	OO
fact	OO
that	OO
so	OO
many	OO
of	OO
my	OO
closest	OO
friends	OO
are	OO
people	OO
that	OO
i	OU
had	OO
met	OO
originally	OO
online	.O
and	OU
i	OU
think	OO
that's	OO
partly	OO
because	OO
there's	OO
this	OO
confessional	OO
nature	OO
to	OO
social	OO
media	.O
it	OU
can	OO
feel	OO
like	OO
you	OO
are	OO
writing	OO
in	OO
this	OO
personal	,O
intimate	OO
diary	OO
that's	OO
completely	OO
private	,O
yet	OO
at	OO
the	OO
same	OO
time	OO
you	OO
want	OO
everyone	OO
in	OO
the	OO
world	OO
to	OO
read	OO
it	.O
and	OU
i	OU
think	OO
part	OO
of	OO
that	,O
the	OO
joy	OO
of	OO
that	OO
is	OO
that	OO
we	OO
get	OO
to	OO
experience	OO
things	OO
from	OO
perspectives	OO
from	OO
people	OO
who	OO
are	OO
completely	OO
different	OO
from	OO
ourselves	,O
and	OO
sometimes	OO
that's	OO
a	OO
nice	OO
thing	.O
for	OU
example	,O
when	OO
i	OU
first	OO
joined	OO
twitter	,U
i	OU
found	OO
that	OO
so	OO
many	OO
of	OO
the	OO
people	OO
that	OO
i	OU
was	OO
following	OO
were	OO
talking	OO
about	OO
mental	OO
health	OO
and	OO
going	OO
to	OO
therapy	OO
in	OO
ways	OO
that	OO
had	OO
none	OO
of	OO
the	OO
stigma	OO
that	OO
they	OO
often	OO
do	OO
when	OO
we	OO
talk	OO
about	OO
these	OO
issues	OO
in	OO
person	.O
through	OU
them	,O
the	OO
conversation	OO
around	OO
mental	OO
health	OO
was	OO
normalized	,O
and	OO
they	OO
helped	OO
me	OO
realize	OO
that	OO
going	OO
to	OO
therapy	OO
was	OO
something	OO
that	OO
would	OO
help	OO
me	OO
as	OO
well	.O
now	,U
for	OO
many	OO
people	,O
it	OO
sounds	OO
like	OO
a	OO
scary	OO
idea	OO
to	OO
be	OO
talking	OO
about	OO
all	OO
these	OO
topics	OO
so	OO
publicly	OO
and	OO
so	OO
openly	OO
on	OO
the	OO
internet	.O
i	OU
feel	OO
like	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
people	OO
think	OO
that	OO
it	OO
is	OO
a	OO
big	,O
scary	OO
thing	OO
to	OO
be	OO
online	OO
if	OO
you're	OO
not	OO
already	OO
perfectly	OO
and	OO
fully	OO
formed	.O
but	OU
i	OU
think	OO
the	OO
internet	OO
can	OO
be	OO
actually	OO
a	OO
great	OO
place	OO
to	OO
not	OO
know	,O
and	OO
i	OU
think	OO
we	OO
can	OO
treat	OO
that	OO
with	OO
excitement	,O
because	OO
to	OO
me	OO
there's	OO
something	OO
important	OO
about	OO
sharing	OO
your	OO
imperfections	OO
and	OO
your	OO
insecurities	OO
and	OO
your	OO
vulnerabilities	OO
with	OO
other	OO
people	.O
now	,U
when	OO
someone	OO
shares	OO
that	OO
they	OO
feel	OO
sad	OO
or	OO
afraid	OO
or	OO
alone	,O
for	OO
example	,O
it	OO
actually	OO
makes	OO
me	OO
feel	OO
less	OO
alone	,O
not	OO
by	OO
getting	OO
rid	OO
of	OO
any	OO
of	OO
my	OO
loneliness	OO
but	OO
by	OO
showing	OO
me	OO
that	OO
i	OU
am	OO
not	OO
alone	OO
in	OO
feeling	OO
lonely	.O
and	OU
as	OO
a	OO
writer	OO
and	OO
as	OO
an	OO
artist	,O
i	OU
care	OO
very	OO
much	OO
about	OO
making	OO
this	OO
comfort	OO
of	OO
being	OO
vulnerable	OO
a	OO
communal	OO
thing	,O
something	OO
that	OO
we	OO
can	OO
share	OO
with	OO
each	OO
other	.O
i'm	OU
excited	OO
about	OO
externalizing	OO
the	OO
internal	,O
about	OO
taking	OO
those	OO
invisible	OO
personal	OO
feelings	OO
that	OO
i	OU
don't	OO
have	OO
words	OO
for	,O
holding	OO
them	OO
to	OO
the	OO
light	,O
putting	OO
words	OO
to	OO
them	,O
and	OO
then	OO
sharing	OO
them	OO
with	OO
other	OO
people	OO
in	OO
the	OO
hopes	OO
that	OO
it	OO
might	OO
help	OO
them	OO
find	OO
words	OO
to	OO
find	OO
their	OO
feelings	OO
as	OO
well	.O
now	,U
i	OU
know	OO
that	OO
sounds	OO
like	OO
a	OO
big	OO
thing	,O
but	OO
ultimately	OO
i'm	OU
interested	OO
in	OO
putting	OO
all	OO
these	OO
things	OO
into	OO
small	,O
approachable	OO
packages	,O
because	OO
when	OO
we	OO
can	OO
hide	OO
them	OO
into	OO
these	OO
smaller	OO
pieces	,O
i	OU
think	OO
they	OO
are	OO
easier	OO
to	OO
approach	,O
i	OU
think	OO
they're	OO
more	OO
fun	.O
i	OU
think	OO
they	OO
can	OO
more	OO
easily	OO
help	OO
us	OO
see	OO
our	OO
shared	OO
humanness	.O
sometimes	OU
that	OO
takes	OO
the	OO
form	OO
of	OO
a	OO
short	OO
story	,O
sometimes	OO
that	OO
takes	OO
the	OO
form	OO
of	OO
a	OO
cute	OO
book	OO
of	OO
illustrations	,O
for	OO
example	.O
and	OU
sometimes	OO
that	OO
takes	OO
the	OO
form	OO
of	OO
a	OO
silly	OO
joke	OO
that	OO
i'll	OU
throw	OO
on	OO
the	OO
internet	.O
for	OU
example	,O
a	OO
few	OO
months	OO
ago	,O
i	OU
posted	OO
this	OO
app	OO
idea	OO
for	OO
a	OO
dog	OO
walking	OO
service	OO
where	OO
a	OO
dog	OO
shows	OO
up	OO
at	OO

and	OO
you	OO
have	OO
to	OO
get	OO
out	OO

go	OO
for	OO
a	OO
walk	.O
if	OU
there	OO
are	OO

developers	OO
in	OO
the	OO
audience	,O
please	OO
find	OO
me	OO
after	OO
the	OO
talk	.O
or	,U
i	OU
like	OO
to	OO

every	OO

i	OU

when	OU

don't	OO

me	,O
i	OU
promise	OO
i'm	OU
trying	OO
my	OO

my	OO
answer	OO
to	OO
the	OO
classic	OO

if	OO
i	OU
could	OO
have	OO
dinner	OO
with	OO
anyone	,O
dead	OO

i	OU

i	OU

i	OU

that	OO
when	OO
i	OU
post	OO
things	OO
like	OO
these	OO
online	,O
the	OO
reaction	OO
is	OO
very	OO
similar	.O
people	OU
come	OO
together	OO
to	OO
share	OO
a	OO
laugh	,O
to	OO
share	OO
in	OO
that	OO

to	OO
disburse	OO
just	OO
as	OO
quickly	.O
yes	,U
leaving	OO
me	OO
once	OO
again	OO
alone	.O
but	OU
i	OU
think	OO
sometimes	OO
these	OO
little	OO
gatherings	OO
can	OO
be	OO
quite	OO
meaningful	.O
for	OU
example	,O
when	OO
i	OU
graduated	OO
from	OO

and	OO
i	OU
moved	OO
to	OO
cambridge	,U
i	OU
posted	OO
this	OO
question:	OO
how	OU
many	OO
people	OO
in	OO
your	OO
life	OO
have	OO
you	OO
already	OO
had	OO
your	OO
last	OO
conversation	OO
with	?O
and	OU
i	OU
was	OO
thinking	OO
about	OO
my	OO

who	OO

how	OO

it	OO
would	OO
be	OO
for	OO
me	OO
to	OO
keep	OO
in	OO

every	OO
time	OO
we	OO
do	OO
this	,O
there's	OO

there's	OU
a	OO

all	OO

together	.O
and	OU
sometimes	,O
through	OO
the	OO
muck	OO
of	OO
the	OO
internet	,O
you	OO
get	OO
to	OO
find	OO
a	OO
kindred	OO
spirit	.O
sometimes	OU
that's	OO
in	OO
the	OO
reading	OO
the	OO
replies	OO

the	OO
comments	OO
sections	OO
and	OO
finding	OO
a	OO
reply	OO
that	OO
is	OO
particularly	OO
kind	OO
or	OO
insightful	OO
or	OO
funny	.O
sometimes	OU
that's	OO
in	OO
going	OO
to	OO
follow	OO
someone	OO
and	OO
seeing	OO
that	OO
they	OO
already	OO
follow	OO
you	OO
back	.O

sometimes	OO
that's	OO
in	OO
looking	OO
at	OO
someone	OO
that	OO
you	OO
know	OO
in	OO

life	OO
and	OO
seeing	OO
the	OO
things	OO
that	OO
you	OO

the	OO
things	OO
that	OO
they	OO
write	OO
and	OO
realizing	OO
that	OO
you	OO
share	OO
so	OO
many	OO
of	OO
the	OO

interests	OO
as	OO
they	OO
do	,O

that	OO

to	OO
you	.O
sometimes	,U
if	OO
you're	OO
lucky	,O
you	OO
get	OO
to	OO
meet	OO
another	OO
alien	.O
but	OU
i	OU
am	OO
worried	,O
too	,O
because	OO
as	OO
we	OO
all	OO
know	,O
the	OO
internet	OO
for	OO
the	OO
most	OO
part	OO
doesn't	OO
feel	OO
like	OO
this	.O
we	OU
all	OO
know	OO
that	OO
for	OO
the	OO
most	OO
part	,O
the	OO
internet	OO
feels	OO
like	OO
a	OO
place	OO
where	OO
we	OO
misunderstand	OO
each	OO
other	,O
where	OO
we	OO
come	OO
into	OO
conflict	OO
with	OO
each	OO
other	,O
where	OO
there's	OO
all	OO
sorts	OO
of	OO
confusion	OO
and	OO
screaming	OO
and	OO
yelling	OO
and	OO
shouting	,O
and	OO
it	OO
feels	OO
like	OO
there's	OO
too	OO
much	OO
of	OO
everything	.O
it	OU
feels	OO
like	OO
chaos	,O
and	OO
i	OU
don't	OO
know	OO
how	OO
to	OO
square	OO
away	OO
the	OO
bad	OO
parts	OO
with	OO
the	OO
good	,O
because	OO
as	OO
we	OO
know	OO
and	OO
as	OO
we've	OO
seen	,O
the	OO
bad	OO
parts	OO
can	OO
really	,O
really	OO
hurt	OO
us	.O
it	OU
feels	OO
to	OO
me	OO
that	OO
the	OO
platforms	OO
that	OO
we	OO
use	OO
to	OO
inhabit	OO
these	OO
online	OO
spaces	OO
have	OO
been	OO
designed	OO
either	OO
ignorantly	OO
or	OO
willfully	OO
to	OO
allow	OO
for	OO
harassment	OO
and	OO
abuse	,O
to	OO
propagate	OO
misinformation	,O
to	OO
enable	OO
hatred	OO
and	OO
hate	OO
speech	OO
and	OO
the	OO
violence	OO
that	OO
comes	OO
from	OO
it	,O
and	OO
it	OO
feels	OO
like	OO
none	OO
of	OO
our	OO
current	OO
platforms	OO
are	OO
doing	OO
enough	OO
to	OO
address	OO
and	OO
to	OO
fix	OO
that	.O
but	OU
still	,O
and	OO
maybe	OO
probably	OO
unfortunately	,O
i'm	OU
still	OO
drawn	OO
to	OO
these	OO
online	OO
spaces	,O
as	OO
many	OO
others	OO
are	,O
because	OO
sometimes	OO
it	OO
just	OO
feels	OO
like	OO
that's	OO
where	OO
all	OO
the	OO
people	OO
are	.O
and	OU
i	OU
feel	OO
silly	OO
and	OO
stupid	OO
sometimes	OO
for	OO
valuing	OO
these	OO
small	OO
moments	OO
of	OO
human	OO
connection	OO
in	OO
times	OO
like	OO
these	.O
but	OU
i've	OU
always	OO
operated	OO
under	OO
this	OO
idea	OO
that	OO
these	OO
little	OO
moments	OO
of	OO
humanness	OO
are	OO
not	OO
superfluous	.O
they're	OU
not	OO
retreats	OO
from	OO
the	OO
world	OO
at	OO
all	,O
but	OO
instead	OO
they're	OO
the	OO
reasons	OO
why	OO
we	OO
come	OO
to	OO
these	OO
spaces	.O
they	OU
are	OO
important	OO
and	OO
vital	OO
and	OO
they	OO
affirm	OO
and	OO
they	OO
give	OO
us	OO
life	.O
and	OU
they	OO
are	OO
these	OO
tiny	,O
temporary	OO
sanctuaries	OO
that	OO
show	OO
us	OO
that	OO
we	OO
are	OO
not	OO
as	OO
alone	OO
as	OO
we	OO
think	OO
we	OO
are	.O
and	OU
so	OO
yes	,O
even	OO
though	OO
life	OO
is	OO
bad	OO
and	OO
everyone's	OO
sad	OO
and	OO
one	OO
day	OO
we're	OO
all	OO
going	OO
to	OO

—	OO
i	OU
think	OO
the	OO
inflatable	OO
metaphorical	OO
bouncy	OO
castle	OO
in	OO
this	OO

is	OO
really	OO
our	OO
relationships	OO
and	OO
our	OO

to	OO

people	.O
and	OU
so	OO
one	OO
night	,O
when	OO
i	OU

sad	OO
and	OO
hopeless	OO
about	OO
the	OO

at	OU
this	OO

someone's	OO

at	OO
the	OO

the	OO

this	OO

i	OU

even	OU
so	,O
my	OO

i	OU
couldn't	OO
resist	OO
the	OO

you're	OO

well	.O
that	OU

i	OU

we	OU
decided	OO
the	OO
world	OO
needed	OO
some	OO
bronx	OU
steasoning	OO
on	OO
it	,O
so	OO
we	OO
mobbed	OO
up	OO
and	OO
formed	OO
ghetto	OU
gastro	.U
while	OU
i'm	OU
aware	OO
our	OO
name	OO
makes	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
people	OO
uncomfortable	,O
for	OO
us	OO
ghetto	OO
means	OO
home	.O
similar	OU
to	OO
the	OO
way	OO
someone	OO
in	OO
mumbai	OU
or	OO
nairobi	OU
might	OO
use	OO
the	OO
word	OO
slum	,O
it's	OO
to	OO
locate	OO

people	OO
and	OO
to	OO
indict	OO
the	OO

that	OO

what	OO

ghetto	OU

it's	OO
a	OO

a	OO

we	OU

from	OO
a	OO

in	OO
the	OO

of	OO
the	OO

above	OO
the	OO

the	OU

use	OO

up	OO
there	OO
to	OO
create	OO

through	OO

this	OU

the	OO

either	OO

the	OO

on	OO
the	OO

they	OU
can	,O
however	,O

from	OO

much	OO
more	OO
efficiently	OO
than	OO

where	OO
they	OO
are	OO

or	OO
from	OO

that	OU
means	OO
that	OO
the	OO

flow	OO
from	OO
the	OO

into	OO
the	OO
fungal	OO
hyphae	.O
once	OU
the	OO

enter	OO
the	OO

they	OO
travel	OO
along	OO
the	OO

through	OO

or	OO
through	OO
special	OO

the	OU
fungus	OO
absorbs	OO
some	OO
of	OO
the	OO

but	OO
some	OO

on	OO

enters	OO
the	OO

of	OO
a	OO

a	OO

in	OO
the	OO

why	OO

this	OU
is	OO
one	OO
of	OO
the	OO

of	OO
the	OO

it	OU
makes	OO

for	OO

to	OO

in	OO

the	OO
exact	OO
ways	OO

maybe	OU
the	OO

from	OO

and	OO
they	OO
went	OO
back	,O

then	OO
ruger	OU
hit	OO
on	OO
a	OO
tiny	OO
matchbox	OO
wrapped	OO
in	OO
a	OO
plastic	OO
bag	OO
inside	OO

and	OU
inside	OO
that	OO

was	OO
a	OO
primer	OO
cap	,O
which	OO
is	OO
an	OO
illegal	OO
firing	OO
pin	OO
for	OO
a	OO

and	OU
so	OO
everyone	,O
all	OO
the	OO
passengers	OO
on	OO
that	OO

all	OO
the	OO
scouts	,O
they	OO
suddenly	OO
believed	.O
they	OU
believed	OO
that	OO
ruger	OU
knew	OO
what	OO
he	OO
was	OO
doing	OO
because	OO
he	OO
didn't	OO
quit	.O
he	OU
has	OO
an	OO
even	OO
more	OO
interesting	OO
backstory	.O
he	OU
came	OO
off	OO
of	OO
an	OO
indian	OU
reservation	,O
the	OO
blackfeet	OU
reservation	OU
in	OO
montana	.U
and	OU
he	OO
was	OO
a	OO
horrible	OO
puppy	,O
and	OO
the	OO
owner	OO
of	OO
this	OO
litter	OO
shot	OO
all	OO
of	OO
the	OO
dogs	.O
somehow	OU
ruger	OU
escaped	,O
he	OO
ended	OO
up	OO
in	OO
a	OO
shelter	OO
in	OO
helena	.U
someone	OU
found	OO
him	OO
and	OO
noticed	OO
how	OO
bad	OO
he	OO
was	OO
and	OO
brought	OO
him	OO
to	OO
us	OO
to	OO
be	OO
trained	OO
as	OO
a	OO
conservation	OO
detection	OO
dog	.O
he	OU
has	OO
made	OO
a	OO
huge	OO
difference	.O
because	OU
of	OO
his	OO
unrelenting	OO
energy	OO
and	OO
desire	OO
to	OO
work	OO
and	OO
love	OO
of	OO
work	,O
he	OO
brings	OO
us	OO
amazing	OO
information	.O
then	OU
there	OO
is	OO
another	OO
dog	OO
i'd	OU
like	OO
you	OO
to	OO
meet	.O
his	OU
name	OO
is	OO
pepin	,U
and	OO
he	OO
is	OO
with	OO
our	OO
executive	,O
dr	.U
pete	OU
coppolillo	,U
who	OO
is	OO
going	OO
to	OO
tell	OO
you	OO
a	OO
little	OO
bit	OO
more	,O
and	OO
i'm	OU
going	OO
to	OO
work	OO
pepin	OU
for	OO
you	.O
pc:	OU
well	,U
megan	,U
pepin	OU
get	OO
ready	.O
i'll	OU
give	OO
you	OO
a	OO
little	OO
update	OO
on	OO
ruger	.U
the	OU
four	OO
months	OO
after	OO
he	OO
made	OO
his	OO
first	OO
find	OO
in	OO
the	OO
minibus	,O
he	OO
detected	OO
and	OO
the	OO
scouts	OO
he	OO
works	OO
with	OO
confiscated	OO
15	OO
guns	.O
mostly	OU
homemade	OO
muzzleloaders	,O
which	OO
are	OO
their	OO
gun	OO
of	OO
preference	OO
for	OO
elephant	OO
poaching	.O
they're	OU
also	OO
used	OO
because	OO
guns	OO
are	OO
hard	OO
to	OO
come	OO
by	OO
in	OO
africa	,U
by	OO
sometimes	OO
seven	,O
sometimes	OO
10	,O
sometimes	OO
more	OO
different	OO
poachers	.O
so	,U
as	OO
of	OO
now	,O
there	OO
may	OO
be	OO
100	OO
150	OO
different	OO
poachers	OO
who	OO
are	OO
out	OO
of	OO
business	OO
thanks	OO
to	OO
ruger	.U
and	OU
for	OO
these	OO
exceptional	,O
really	OO
high	OO
drive	OO
dogs	,O
you	OO
know	,O
ruger	OU
is	OO
really	OO
the	OO
rule	OO
rather	OO
than	OO
the	OO
exception	.O
and	OU
i'll	OU
tell	OO
you	OO
about	OO
a	OO
couple	OO
more	.O
this	OU
is	OO
seamus	.U
seamus	OU
is	OO
trained	OO
to	OO
detect	OO
dyer’s	OO
woad	,O
which	OO
is	OO
the	OO
weed	OO
that's	OO
in	OO
that	OO
pot	OO
there	.O
and	OU
speaking	OO
of	OO
resilience	,O
dyer’s	OO
woad	OO
drops	OO
between	OO
12,000	OO
and	OO
15,000	OO
seeds	OO
a	OO
year	.O
so	OU
it's	OO
a	OO
noxious	OO
weed	,O
and	OO
when	OO
it	OO
gets	OO
established	,O
it's	OO
very	OO
hard	OO
to	OO
get	OO
rid	OO
of	.O
so	OU
people	OO
were	OO
working	OO
on	OO
getting	OO
rid	OO
of	OO
it	OO
on	OO
mount	OU
sentinel	OU
in	OO
missoula	OU
for	OO
about	OO
10	OO
years	,O
and	OO
they	OO
weren't	OO
making	OO
any	OO
progress	.O
so	OU
in	OO
2011	,O
we	OO
brought	OO
in	OO
seamus	.U
and	OU
seamus	OU
is	OO
able	OO
to	OO
do	OO
something	OO
that	OO
we	OO
human	OO
searchers	OO
can't	,O
which	OO
is	OO
find	OO
it	OO
by	OO
smell	OO
before	OO
it	OO
flowers	.O
seamus	OU
has	OO
knocked	OO
back	OO
dyer’s	OO
woad	OO
by	OO
over	OO
95	OO
percent	.O
thanks	OU
to	OO
him	,O
we're	OO
going	OO
to	OO
do	OO
something	OO
that	OO
was	OO
unthinkable	OO
just	OO
a	OO
few	OO
years	OO
ago	,O
which	OO
is	OO
eradicate	OO
a	OO
noxious	OO
weed	,O
a	OO
bad	OO
infestation	OO
of	OO
a	OO
noxious	OO
weed	.O
and	OU
this	OO
is	OO
wicket	.U
wicket	OU
is	OO
one	OO
of	OO
the	OO
best	OO
stories	.O
she	OU
was	OO
in	OO
a	OO
shelter	OO
in	OO
anaconda	,U
montana	,U
and	OO
when	OO
we	OO
came	OO
to	OO
get	OO
her	,O
the	OO
director	OO
of	OO
the	OO
shelter	OO
said	,O
you	OU
don't	OO
want	OO
that	OO
dog	.O
that	OU
dog	OO
is	OO
crazy	.O
and	OU
now	OO
aimee	OU
famously	OO
said	,O
i	OU
think	OO
she	OO
might	OO
be	OO
the	OO
right	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
crazy	.O
wicket	OU
is	OO
now	OO
the	OO
most	OO
accomplished	OO
conservation	OO
detection	OO
dog	OO
in	OO
the	OO
world	.O
she's	OU
worked	OO
on	OO
three	OO
continents	,O
she's	OO
worked	OO
in	OO
dozens	OO
of	OO
us	OU
states	,O
and	OO
here	OO
she	OO
is	OO
searching	OO
a	OO
boat	OO
for	OO
zebra	OO
mussels	OO
which	OO

a	OO
microscopic	OO
larval	OO
stage	OO
that	OO
we	OO
can't	OO
see	.O
speaking	OU
of	OO
accomplished	OO
and	OO
crazy	,O
now	OO
you	OO
guys	OO
will	OO
get	OO
to	OO
watch	OO
pepin	OU
do	OO
his	OO
thing	.O
so	OU
meg's	OU
put	OO
his	OO
vest	OO
on	.O
that	OU
is	OO
his	OO
signal	OO
that	OO
it's	OO
time	OO
to	OO
work	.O
you	OU
can	OO
see	OO
he's	OO
low	OO
focused	.O
he	OU
is	OO
ready	OO
to	OO
go	.O
so	OU
i	OU
hid	OO
ivory	.O
i	OU
hid	OO
some	OO
ivory	OO
in	OO
the	OO
room	.O
pepin	OU
is	OO
one	OO
of	OO
the	OO
ivory	OO
dogs	,O
and	OO
i	OU
hid	OO
some	OO
ivory	OO
in	OO
the	OO
room	.O
you	,U
guys	,O
just	OO
stay	OO
put	.O
he's	OU
also	OO
not	OO
trained	OO
on	OO
narcotics	,O
so	OO
no	OO
one	OO
has	OO
to	OO
make	OO
a	OO
run	,O
for	OO
the	OO
door	OO
or	OO
anything	OO
like	OO
that	,O
and	OO
when	OO
meg	OU
tells	OO
him	OO
to	OO
go	,O
he'll	OO
do	OO
his	OO
thing	.O
so	OU
what	OO
you're	OO
going	OO
to	OO
see	OO
is	OO
you're	OO
going	OO
to	OO
see	OO
him	OO
work	,O
and	OO
you	OO
can	OO
watch	OO
his	OO
head	,O
he'll	OO
move	OO
his	OO
head	OO
up	OO
and	OO
down	,O
it's	OO
a	OO
little	OO
hard	OO
indoors	OO
because	OO
there's	OO
not	OO
much	OO
air	OO
moving	OO
around	OO
in	OO
here	.O
but	OU
he'll	OO
search	,O
and	OO
you	OO
may	OO
see	OO
him	OO
whip	OO
around	,O
change	OO
directions	,O
his	OO
alert	OO
is	OO
something	OO
we	OO
call	OO
passive	OO
alert	.O
he	OU
sits	.O
and	OU
the	OO
reason	OO
he	OO
does	OO
that	OO
is	OO
because	OO
we	OO
have	OO
him	OO
trained	OO
not	OO
to	OO
disturb	OO
the	OO
samples	.O
sometimes	OU
it's	OO
a	OO
crime	OO
scene	,O
so	OO
they	OO
want	OO
to	OO
collect	OO
evidence	.O
sometimes	OU
we	OO
collect	OO
scats	OO
for	OO
dna	OU
or	OO
things	OO
like	OO
that	.O
normally	,U
he	OO
works	OO
in	OO
big	OO
open	OO
places	.O
he	OU
is	OO
trained	OO
on	OO
grizzly	OO
bear	,O
he	OO
is	OO
trained	OO
on	OO
wolverine	,O
so	OO
he	OO
runs	OO
on	OO
big	,O
high	OO
meadows	OO
and	OO
pastures	,O
but	OO
he's	OO
also	OO
trained	OO
on	OO
containers	,O
vehicles	OO
and	OO
buildings	.O
and	OU
he's	OO
checking	OO
there	.O
you	OU
see	OO
he's	OO
got	OO
scent	OO
now	.O
there	OU
he	OO
goes	.O
good	OU
job	,O
pal	.O
that's	OU
his	OO
alert	.O
and	OU
she	OO
has	OO
a	OO
command	OO
that	OO
is	,O
show	OU
me	.O
and	OU
he'll	OO
show	OO
where	OO
it	OO
is	.O

that's	OO
a	OO
broken	OO
ivory	OO

well	OU

a	OO

between	OO

the	OU
reality	OO

that	OO

a	OO
result	OO
of	OO
the	OO

we	OO
ended	OO
up	OO
holding	OO
a	OO

tie	OO
into	OO
the	OO

i	OU
ran	OO
the	OO
new	OU

city	OU
marathon	OU
in	OO
chains	OO
to	OO
spread	OO
awareness	OO
to	OO
this	OO

i	OU
was	OO

for	OO

a	OO

at	OO
their	OO

we	OU

it	OO
everything	OO
that	OO
we	OO
had	,O
but	OO
in	OO
the	OO
end	,O
new	OU
york	OU
city	OU
decided	OO
to	OO
keep	OO
the	OO
statue	,O
and	OO
new	OU
york	OU
state	OU
unanimously	OO
voted	OO
to	OO
make	OO
it	OO
a	OO

the	OU
news	OO
was	OO
devastating	,O
but	OO
it	OO
opened	OO
up	OO
another	OO
door	.O
we	OU
realized	OO
that	OO
with	OO
augmented	OO
reality	OO
you	OO
don't	OO
need	OO
permission	OO
from	OO
the	OO
government	OO
to	OO
put	OO
up	OO
a	OO
monument	OO
or	OO
to	OO
make	OO
a	OO
statement	.O
you	OU
can	OO
just	OO
do	OO
it	.O
so	OU
new	OU
york	OU
city	OU
right	OO
now	OO
currently	OO
has	OO
more	OO
than	OO
150	OO
statues	OO
of	OO
men	OO
and	OO
six	OO
of	OO
women	OO
and	OO
currently	OO
acknowledges	OO
slaveholders	OO
in	OO
public	OO
spaces	OO
as	OO
well	.O
so	OU
we	OO
decided	,O
why	OO
not	OO
just	OO
put	OO
up	OO
a	OO
bunch	OO
of	OO
ar	OU
monuments	OO
of	OO
women	OO
and	OO
people	OO
of	OO
color	OO
throughout	OO
the	OO
city	?O
typically	,U
monuments	OO
are	OO
created	OO
to	OO
commemorate	OO
the	OO
achievements	OO
of	OO
the	OO
deceased	,O
but	OO
with	OO
augmented	OO
reality	,O
we	OO
can	OO
reroute	OO
the	OO
rules	.O
we	OU
started	OO
with	OO
sports	.O
colin	OU
kaepernick	.U
he	OU
was	OO
the	OO
starting	OO
quarterback	OO
of	OO
the	OO
san	OU
francisco	OU
49ers	,O
and	OO
he	OO
wanted	OO
to	OO
use	OO
his	OO
platform	OO
to	OO
highlight	OO
the	OO
injustice	OO
of	OO
systemic	OO
racism	.O
so	OU
he	OO
consulted	OO
a	OO
green	OU
beret	OU
on	OO
the	OO
most	OO
respectful	OO
way	OO
to	OO
do	OO
this	,O
and	OO
he	OO
decided	OO
to	OO
take	OO
a	OO
knee	OO
during	OO
the	OO
national	OO
anthem	.O
he	OU
lost	OO
his	OO
contract	OO
with	OO
the	OO
49ers	,O
he	OO
was	OO
blackballed	OO
by	OO
every	OO
nfl	OU
owner	,O
he	OO
was	OO
criticized	OO
by	OO
millions	OO
and	OO
even	OO
the	OO
president	OO
of	OO
the	OO
united	OU
states	OU
decided	OO
to	OO
insult	OO
him	.O
it	OU
may	OO
be	OO
decades	OO
before	OO
colin	OU
kaepernick	OU
is	OO
adequately	OO
respected	OO
for	OO
his	OO
courage	,O
so	OO
our	OO
team	OO
decided	OO
to	OO
do	OO
this	.O
now	OU
anyone	OO
that	OO
walks	OO
by	OO
trump	OU

can	OO
see	OO
colin	OU
kaepernick	OU
take	OO
a	OO
knee	OO
in	OO
augmented	OO

and	OO
there's	OO
nothing	OO
they	OO

do	OO
about	OO
it	.O

who	OO

how	OO
many	OO

you	OO
have	OO
thought	,O
wouldn't	OU
it	OO
be	OO
great	OO
to	OO
know	OO
what	OO
my	OO
dog	OO
is	OO
thinking	?O
i	OU
think	OO
everyone	OO
else	OO
already	OO
knows	OO
what	OO
their	OO
dog	OO
is	OO
thinking	,O
right	?O
i	OU
got	OO
into	OO
this	OO
project	,O
and	OO
i'm	OU
going	OO
to	OO
tell	OO
you	OO
a	OO
little	OO
bit	OO
about	OO
how	OO
this	OU
is	OO
basically	OO
a	OO
stupid	OO
dog	OO
trick	OO
story	.O
it	OU
really	OO
started	OO
with	OO
this	OO
dog	OO
named	OO
newton	,U
who	OO
was	OO
really	OO
my	OO
favorite	OO
dog	.O
i've	OU
had	OO
many	OO
dogs	OO
through	OO
my	OO
life	,O
but	OO
newton	OU
was	OO
my	OO
favorite	,O
and	OO
he	OO
lived	OO
to	OO
be	OO
about	OO
15	OO
years	OO
old	.O
after	OU
he	OO
passed	OO
away	,O
i	OU
thought	,O
i	OU
have	OO
these	OO
tools	,O
this	OO
mri	OU
machine	,O
that	OO
i	OU
have	OO
been	OO
using	OO
for	OO
decades	OO
to	OO
study	OO
human	OO
decision	OO
making	OO
and	OO
what	OO
motivates	OO
people	,O
why	OO
haven't	OO
we	OO
used	OO
this	OO
on	OO
other	OO
animals	?O
certainly	,U
other	OO
animals	OO
have	OO
many	OO
of	OO
the	OO
same	OO
feelings	OO
and	OO
motivations	OO
that	OO
people	OO
do	.O
but	OU
this	OO
is	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
an	OO
area	OO
of	OO
science	OO
that	OO
people	OO
don't	OO
like	OO
to	OO
talk	OO
about	.O
so	OU
i	OU
embarked	OO
on	OO
this	OO
project	OO
about	OO
four	OO
years	OO
ago	OO
to	OO
try	OO
to	OO
figure	OO
out	OO
what	OO
dogs	OO
think	,O
and	OO
specifically	OO
what	OO
dogs	OO
think	OO
of	OO
us	.O
if	OU
we're	OO
talking	OO
about	OO
humans	,O
we	OO
have	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
two	OO
ways	OO
we	OO
can	OO
think	OO
about	OO
what	OO
other	OO
people	OO
are	OO
thinking:	OO
we	OO
can	OO
either	OO
ask	OO
them	,O
and	OO
sometimes	OO
they	OO
will	OO
tell	OO
us	OO
if	OO
they	OO
know	,O
and	OO
they	OO
want	OO
us	OO
to	OO
know	OO
what	OO
they	OO
are	OO
thinking;	OO
or	OO
we	OO
can	OO
observe	OO
actions	,O
we	OO
can	OO
observe	OO
behaviors	,O
we	OO
can	OO
try	OO
to	OO
infer	OO
things	OO
about	OO
what	OO
people	OO
are	OO
thinking	OO
from	OO
their	OO
actions	.O
with	OU
animals	,O
and	OO
dogs	,O
of	OO
course	,O
we	OO
can't	OO
really	OO
ask	OO
them	.O
we	OU
can	OO
ask	OO
them	,O
and	OO
we	OO
may	OO
think	OO
that	OO
they	OO
tell	OO
us	,O
but	OO
we	OO
really	OO
don't	OO
know	OO
what	OO
they're	OO
thinking	.O
so	OU
we're	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
left	OO
with	OO
their	OO
behaviors:	OO
we	OO
can	OO
observe	OO
their	OO
actions	,O
and	OO
we	OO
can	OO
try	OO
to	OO
infer	OO
what	OO
they	OO
are	OO
thinking	.O
this	OU
is	OO
the	OO
foundation	OO
of	OO
behaviorism	,O
and	OO
it's	OO
been	OO
around	OO
since	OO
pavlov	.U
but	OU
there	OO
are	,O
of	OO
course	,O
very	OO
tricky	OO
issues	OO
here	,O
and	OO
humans	OO
being	OO
humans	,O
we	OO
tend	OO
to	OO
anthropomorphize	OO
everything	.O
it's	OU
kind	OO
of	OO
in	OO
this	OO
area	OO
that	OO
i	OU
became	OO
very	OO
interested	OO
in	OO
intrigued	OO
with	OO
the	OO
possibility	OO
of	OO
trying	OO
to	OO
figure	OO
out	OO
what	OO
dogs	OO
are	OO
thinking	OO
by	OO
using	OO
mri	.U
the	OU
technique	OO
is	OO
straightforward	.O
it's	OU
been	OO
around	OO
for	OO
decades	.O
the	OU
idea	OO
is:	OO
if	OO
we	OO
were	OO
studying	OO
a	OO
human	,O
we	OO
would	OO
put	OO
a	OO
human	OO
in	OO
an	OO
mri	,U
have	OO
them	OO
do	OO
some	OO
type	OO
of	OO
task	,O
and	OO
we'd	OO
measure	OO
blood	OO
flow	OO
or	OO
brain	OO
activity	OO
and	OO
then	OO
try	OO
to	OO
figure	OO
out	OO
what	OO
parts	OO
of	OO
the	OO
brain	OO
do	OO
what	.O
very	OU
straightforward	,O
if	OO
you've	OO
had	OO
an	OO
mri	,U
it's	OO
not	OO
terribly	OO
pleasant	,O
but	OO
people	OO
will	OO
do	OO
it	.O
how	OU
do	OO
we	OO
do	OO
this	OO
with	OO
other	OO
animals	?O
how	OU
do	OO
we	OO
do	OO
it	OO
with	OO
a	OO
dog	?O
i'm	OU
going	OO
to	OO
show	OO
you	OO
what	OO
we	OO
found	.O
here's	OU
a	OO
short	OO
video	.O
it's	OU
a	OO
what	OO
we	OO
call	OO
our	OO
training	OO
video	,O
and	OO
it	OO
demonstrates	OO
how	OO
we	OO
did	OO
this	.O
before	OU
i	OU
start	OO
it	,O
you're	OO
going	OO
to	OO
see	OO
two	OO
dogs	OO
in	OO
this	OO
video	.O
the	OU
first	OO
dog	,O
callie	,U
is	OO
my	OO
dog	.O
she	OU
was	OO
actually	OO
the	OO
replacement	OO
for	OO
newton	.U
she	OU
was	OO
adopted	OO
here	OO
in	OO
atlanta	OU
from	OO
the	OO
humane	OU
society	.U
we	OU
loved	OO
newton	OU
so	OO
much;	OO
we	OO
could	OO
never	OO
get	OO
another	OO
pug	,O
so	OO
callie	OU
is	OO
the	OO
anti	OO
pug	.O
the	OU
other	OO
dog	OO
is	OO
mckenzie	,U
a	OO
border	OO
collie	.O
we	OU
just	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
get	OO
right	OO
into	OO
it	.O
i'll	OU
narrate	OO
as	OO
we	OO
go	OO
along	.O
this's	OU
mark	OU
spivak	.U
he's	OU
my	OO
partner	OO
in	OO
this	OO
endeavor	,O
he's	OO
a	OO
dog	OO
trainer	.O
the	OU
first	OO
thing	OO
that	OO
we	OO
had	OO
to	OO
do	OO
is	OO
figure	OO
out	OO
how	OO
do	OO
we	OO
get	OO
dogs	OO
to	OO
go	OO
into	OO
a	OO
tube	,O
to	OO
put	OO
a	OO
head	OO
coil	OO
around	OO
their	OO
head	OO
to	OO
pick	OO
up	OO
the	OO
brain	OO
waves	,O
and	OO
hold	OO
absolutely	OO
still	.O
what	OU
you	OO
are	OO
seeing	OO
here	,O
is	OO
that	OO
callie	OU
is	OO
not	OO
a	OO
particularly	OO
obedient	OO
dog;	OO
she	OO
has	OO
no	OO
particularly	OO
special	OO
skills	.O
but	OU
she	OO
does	OO
have	OO
one	OO
very	OO
good	OO
trait	,O
and	OO
that	OO
is:	OO
she	OO
likes	OO
hot	OO
dogs	.O
mark	OU
is	OO
doing	OO
what	OO
we	OO
call	OO
clicker	OO
training	.O
every	OU
time	OO
she	OO
approximates	OO
what	OO
we	OO
want	OO
her	OO
to	OO
do	,O
he	OO
clicks	,O
and	OO
then	OO
she	OO
gets	OO
a	OO
hot	OO
dog	.O
this's	OU
the	OO
very	OO
first	OO
time	OO
she's	OO
been	OO
introduced	OO
to	OO
the	OO
thing	OO
we	OO
call	OO
the	OO
head	OO
coil	,O
and	OO
we	OO
didn't	OO
know	OO
at	OO
this	OO
point	OO
whether	OO
this	OO
was	OO
even	OO
going	OO
to	OO
be	OO
possible	.O
this	OU
dog	,O
mckenzie	,U
a	OO
border	OO
collie	,O
is	OO
highly	OO
trained	.O
she's	OU
very	OO
skilled	OO
in	OO
agility	,O
and	OO
her	OO
owner	,O
as	OO
you'll	OO
see	,O
gets	OO
her	OO
to	OO
sit	OO
in	OO
this	OO
coil	OO
very	OO
quickly	.O
dog	OU
owner:	OO
good	OU
girl	.O
yes	.U
is	OU
she	OO
too	OO
far	OO
out	OO
now	?O
gregory	OU
berns:	OU
yeah	,U
basically	,O
we	OO
are	OO
looking	OO
for	OO
the	OO
brain	OO
case	OO
to	OO
be	OO
in	OO
the	OO
center	,O
right	OO
there	.O
that's	OU
good	.O
gb:	OU
if	OU
you've	OO
had	OO
an	OO
mri	,U
you	OO
know	OO
that	OO
you're	OO
told	OO
not	OO
to	OO
move	,O
right	?O
this	OU
is	OO
the	OO
big	OO
challenge	OO
of	OO
doing	OO
this	.O
up	OU
until	OO
this	OO
point	,O
i	OU
didn't	OO
know	OO
if	OO
this	OO
was	OO
going	OO
to	OO
be	OO
possible	OO
until	OO
i	OU
saw	OO
this	.O
this	OU
was	OO
literally	OO
after	OO
about	OO
five	OO
minutes	OO
of	OO
training	.O
when	OU
i	OU
saw	OO
that	,O
i	OU
knew	OO
we	OO
could	OO
do	OO
this	.O
what	OU
you	OO
saw	OO
mckenzie	OU
doing	OO
was	OO
close	OO
but	OO
not	OO
quite	OO
good	OO
enough	.O
what	OU
we	OO
are	OO
going	OO
after	OO
if	OO
we're	OO
to	OO
achieve	OO
data	OO
that	OO
compares	OO
to	OO
humans	OO
gb:	OU
you	OU
are	OO
perfect	.O
excellent	.U
perfect	OU
job	.O
gb:	OU
mark	OU
told	OO
me	OO
i	OU
had	OO
to	OO
be	OO
more	OO
demonstrative	OO
than	OO
i	OU
am	OO
normally	.O
gb:	OU
perfect	.U
yes	.U
gb:	OU
what	OU
you	OO
notice	OO
we	OO
did	OO
was	OO
we	OO
introduced	OO
a	OO
little	OO
chin	OO
rest	OO
because	OO
we	OO
have	OO
to	OO
give	OO
the	OO
dogs	OO
a	OO
target	OO
to	OO
put	OO
their	OO
head	OO
on	.O
mckenzie	OU
adapts	OO
this	OO
very	OO
quickly	.O
she's	OU
actually	OO
in	OO
a	OO
simulator	OO
for	OO
an	OO
mri	OU
that	OO
we	OO
built	.O
she's	OU
doing	OO
quite	OO
well	,O
but	OO
this	OO
is	OO
actually	OO
still	OO
too	OO
much	OO
movement	.O
the	OU
really	OO
difficult	OO
part	OO
of	OO
this	OO
is	OO
the	OO
noise	OO
that	OO
the	OO
scanner	OO
makes	,O
playing	OO
in	OO
the	OO
background	.O
these	OU
are	OO
recordings	OO
that	OO
we	OO
made	OO
to	OO
acclimate	OO
the	OO
dogs	OO
to	OO
the	OO
training	.O
it's	OU
very	OO
loud	.O
this's	OU
being	OO
played	OO
at	OO
low	OO
volume	OO
just	OO
to	OO
get	OO
her	OO
used	OO
to	OO
it	.O
but	OU
it's	OO
really	OO
about	OO
95	OO
decibels	,O
and	OO
it's	OO
like	OO
jackhammer	OO
loud	.O
gb:	OU
that's	OU
it	,O
that	OO
what	OO
we	OO
are	OO
doing	.O
gb:	OU
this	OU
is	OO
after	OO
about	OO
a	OO
month	OO
or	OO
two	OO
of	OO
training	.O
we're	OU
at	OO
the	OO
real	OO
mri	OU
now	.O
this's	OU
probably	OO
the	OO
most	OO
expensive	OO
training	OO
session	OO
ever	OO
performed	.O
we	OU
get	OO
charged	OO
about	OO
500	OO
dollars	OO
an	OO
hour	OO
to	OO
use	OO
the	OO
mri	.U
but	OU
we	OO
had	OO
to	OO
use	OO
the	OO
real	OO
thing	OO
at	OO
a	OO
certain	OO
point	.O
at	OU
this	OO
point	,O
we	OO
didn't	OO
even	OO
know	OO
how	OO
they	OO
would	OO
react	OO
to	OO
the	OO
magnetic	OO
field	.O
the	OU
key	OO
thing	OO
i	OU
want	OO
you	OO
to	OO
notice	OO
is	OO
these	OO
dogs	OO
are	OO
doing	OO
it	OO
willingly	,O
and	OO
they	OO
enjoy	OO
it	.O
that	OU
is	OO
the	OO
whole	OO
point	OO
of	OO
this	OO
project	.O
we	OU
treat	OO
these	OO
animals	OO
as	OO
family	OO
members	.O
we	OU
don't	OO
sedate	OO
them	,O
and	OO
we	OO
don't	OO
restrain	OO
them	.O
this's	OU
actually	OO
after	OO
about	OO
two	OO
months	OO
of	OO
training	.O
we	OU
made	OO
some	OO
modifications	OO
to	OO
the	OO
chin	OO
rest	,O
and	OO
even	OO
a	OO
shelter	OO
dog	OO
like	OO
callie	OU
can	OO
do	OO
this	.O
if	OU
you	OO
look	OO
carefully	,O
you	OO
also	OO
notice	OO
that	OO
she's	OO
wearing	OO
ear	OO
muffs	.O
it's	OU
very	OO
important	OO
because	OO
the	OO
scanner	OO
is	OO
so	OO
loud	,O
and	OO
the	OO
dogs	OO
hearing	OO
is	OO
quite	OO
sensitive	.O
the	OU
other	OO
thing	OO
that	OO
we	OO
did	OO
this's	OU
a	OO
scientific	OO
experiment	,O
really	.O
that's	OU
the	OO
training	OO
video	.O
the	OU
hot	OO
dog	,O
no	OO
hot	OO
dog	OO
hand	OO
signals	,O
we	OO
started	OO
with	OO
this	OO
because	OO
we	OO
didn't	OO
know	OO
if	OO
this	OO
was	OO
going	OO
to	OO
work	,O
so	OO
we	OO
decided	OO
we	OO
needed	OO
to	OO
do	OO
something	OO
really	OO
simple	.O
this's	OU
just	OO
straight	OO
up	OO
pavlovian	OU
conditioning	OO
where	OO
we	OO
taught	OO
the	OO
dogs	OO
two	OO
hand	OO
signals:	OO
this	OO
means	OO
hot	OO
dog	,O
and	OO
this	OO
means	OO
no	OO
hot	OO
dog	.O
if	OU
this	OO
technique	OO
works	,O
what	OO
we	OO
should	OO
see	OO
is	OO
activity	OO
in	OO
the	OO
reward	OO
system	OO
of	OO
their	OO
brain	OO
to	OO
this	OO
hand	OO
signal	OO
but	OO
not	OO
this	OO
signal	.O
i	OU
also	OO
put	OO
up	OO
a	OO
slide	OO
here	.O
once	OU
we	OO
started	OO
doing	OO
this	,O
the	OO
word	OO
got	OO
out	OO
amongst	OO
the	OO
community	OO
here	OO
in	OO
atlanta	OU
that	OO
we're	OO
doing	OO
this	OO
crazy	OO
dog	OO
scanning	OO
project	.O
we're	OU
looking	OO
for	OO
volunteers	,O
especially	OO
people	OO
who	OO
like	OO
to	OO
train	OO
dogs	OO
and	OO
have	OO
dogs	OO
that	OO
are	OO
very	OO
well	OO
behaved	.O
that's	OU
still	OO
true	.O
if	OU
you	OO
have	OO
a	OO
dog	OO
that	OO
can	OO
do	OO
this	OO
or	OO
you	OO
think	OO
can	OO
do	OO
this	,O
talk	OO
to	OO
me	.O
because	OU
the	OO
project	OO
is	OO
still	OO
going	OO
on	,O
and	OO
it's	OO
gotten	OO
quite	OO
large	.O
you've	OU
seen	OO
the	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
preliminary	OO
video	.O
this's	OU
one	OO
of	OO
my	OO
favorite	OO
photos	OO
because	OO
it's	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
captures	OO
this	OO
is	OO
the	OO
first	OO
day	OO
we	OO
were	OO
actually	OO
doing	OO
the	OO
scanning	.O
it	OU
captures	OO
the	OO
human	OO
confusion	OO
here	.O
we	OU
were	OO
just	OO
standing	OO
around	OO
trying	OO
to	OO
figure	OO
out	OO
how	OO
we	OO
are	OO
going	OO
to	OO
do	OO
this	.O
but	OU
callie	OU
knows	,O
she's	OO
been	OO
trained	,O
she's	OO
been	OO
doing	OO
this	OO
for	OO
two	OO
months;	OO
so	OO
she's	OO
ready	OO
to	OO
go	.O
the	OU
head	OO

is	OO
just	OO
to	OO
keep	OO
the	OO

in	OO

this	OU

what	OO
it	OO

from	OO

of	OO
the	OO

this's	OU
actually	OO
a	OO
dog	OO
named	OO
zen	.U
he's	OU
a	OO
yellow	OO
lab	OO
golden	OO

what	OU
we're	OO
studying	OO
initially	OO
is	OO
just	OO
the	OO
reward	OO
system	OO
response	.O
very	OU
simply	,O
we	OO
got	OO
these	OO
two	OO
hand	OO
signals	,O
and	OO
the	OO
idea	OO
is	OO
we	OO
compare	OO
the	OO
brain	OO
response	OO
to	OO
these	OO
two	OO
things	.O
as	OU
i	OU
said	,O
we	OO
have	OO
many	OO
dogs	OO
doing	OO
this	OO
now	,O
it's	OO
not	OO
just	OO
shelter	OO
dogs	.O
we	OU
have	OO
dogs	OO
from	OO
service	OO
dog	OO
organizations	,O
we	OO
have	OO
shelter	OO
dogs	OO
really	OO
all	OO
sorts	OO
of	OO
breeds	.O
before	OU
i	OU
show	OO
you	OO
some	OO
of	OO
the	OO
results	,O
i	OU
do	OO
want	OO
to	OO
say	OO
something	OO
about	OO
brain	OO
anatomy	.O
a	OU
dog	OO
brain	OO
this	OO
slide	OO
is	OO
not	OO
to	OO
scale	.O
a	OU
dog	OO
brain	OO
is	OO
probably	OO
about	OO
the	OO
size	OO
of	OO
a	OO
plum	OO
or	OO
a	OO
lemon	OO
maybe	,O
depending	OO
on	OO
the	OO
size	OO
of	OO
the	OO
dog	.O
it's	OU
not	OO
big	,O
even	OO
if	OO
you	OO
have	OO
a	OO
big	OO
dog	,O
most	OO
of	OO
the	OO
head	OO
is	OO
muscle	,O
so	OO
just	OO
going	OO
to	OO
be	OO
aware	OO
of	OO
that	.O
but	OU
i	OU
like	OO
putting	OO
up	OO
this	OO
slide	OO
because	OO
it	OO
shows	OO
the	OO
similarities	OO
of	OO
animal	OO
brains	.O
you	OU
can	OO
immediately	OO
make	OO
out	OO
common	OO
structures	.O
you	OU
can	OO
see	OO
towards	OO
the	OO
right	OO
that	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
pretty	OO
structure	OO
is	OO
the	OO
cerebellum	OO
that	OO
controls	OO
various	OO
types	OO
of	OO
motor	OO
movement	,O
and	OO
then	OO
below	OO
that	,O
there	OO
is	OO
the	OO
brainstem	.O
the	OU
really	OO
the	OO
parts	OO
of	OO
the	OO
brain	OO
that	OO
are	OO
different	OO
are	OO
what	OO
we	OO
call	OO
the	OO
cortex	.O
that's	OU
the	OO
upper	OO
part	,O
the	OO
folded	OO
part	.O
the	OU
big	OO
differences	OO
between	OO

have	OO
to	OO
do	OO
with	OO
the	OO
size	OO
of	OO
the	OO
cortex	OO
and	OO
how	OO

it	OO
is	.O
what	OU
folding	OO
accomplishes	OO
is	OO
packing	OO
a	OO

a	OO

what	OU

what	OU

the	OO

this's	OU
a	OO
very	OO
compact	OO
way	OO
of	OO
summarizing	OO
an	OO
experiment	OO
which	OO
i	OU
showed	OO
you	OO
where	OO
the	OO
dogs	OO
receive	OO
two	OO
different	OO
hand	OO

and	OO
we've	OO
averaged	OO
the	OO
results	OO
over	,O
in	OO
this	OO
case	,O
12	OO
dogs	,O
i	OU
think	OO
though	,O
we've	OO
done	OO
this	OO
probably	OO
in	OO
over	OO
20	OO
dogs	.O
the	OU
orange	OO
areas	OO
show	OO
what	OO
parts	OO
of	OO
the	OO

are	OO
more	OO
active	OO
to	OO
this	OO
reward	OO
signal	,O
this	OO
hot	OO
dog	OO
signal	.O
what	OU
i	OU
want	OO
to	OO
emphasize	OO
is	OO
the	OO
brain	OO
response	OO
is	OO
not	OO
directly	OO
to	OO
hot	OO
dogs	,O
it's	OO
to	OO
the	OO
hand	OO
signal	OO
that	OO
means	OO
hot	OO
dogs	.O
you	OU
may	OO
think	OO
that's	OO
not	OO
a	OO
big	OO
deal;	OO
it's	OO
still	OO
hot	OO
dogs	.O
it's	OU
no	OO
surprise	OO
that	OO
dogs	OO
like	OO
hot	OO
dogs	.O
but	OU
it	OO
is	OO
a	OO
big	OO
deal	OO
because	OO
we	OO
train	OO
this	OO
signal;	OO
it's	OO
a	OO
symbolic	OO
representation	OO
of	OO
a	OO
hot	OO
dog	OO
that	OO
the	OO
dog	OO
has	OO
learned	OO
and	OO
has	OO
learned	OO
to	OO
recognize	OO
this	OO
meaning	.O
the	OU
particular	OO
parts	OO
of	OO
the	OO
brain	OO
that	OO
are	OO
being	OO
active	OO
are	OO
the	OO
reward	OO
system	.O
there's	OU
kind	OO
of	OO
two	OO
hot	OO
spots	.O
there's	OU
a	OO
headlight	OO
type	OO
picture	.O
that's	OU
in	OO
an	OO
area	OO
of	OO
the	OO
brain	OO
called	OO
the	OO
cortex	OO
nucleus	.O
it's	OU
the	OO
area	OO
of	OO
the	OO
brain	OO
that	OO
all	OO
mammals	OO
have	,O
and	OO
it's	OO
the	OO
area	OO
that	OO
has	OO
the	OO
most	OO
dopamine	OO
receptors	OO
in	OO
the	OO
brain	.O
it's	OU
kind	OO
of	OO
the	OO
key	OO
center	OO
that	OO
links	OO
reward	OO
and	OO
motivation	OO
with	OO
action	.O
normally	,U
when	OO
that's	OO
active	OO
in	OO
a	OO
human	OO
or	OO
any	OO
other	OO
animal	,O
it	OO
means	OO
that	OO
something	OO
important	OO
has	OO
happened	,O
and	OO
the	OO
animal	OO
needs	OO
to	OO
do	OO
something	.O
in	OU
this	OO
case	OO
it's	OO
quite	OO
simple	OO
because	OO
they	OO
will	OO
just	OO
eat	OO
the	OO
hot	OO
dogs	.O
well	,U
so	OO
what	?O
so	OU
we	OO
proved	OO
that	OO
dog	OO
brains	OO
like	OO
hot	OO
dogs	.O
that	OU
was	OO
just	OO
the	OO
beginning	.O
this	OU
started	OO
about	OO
four	OO
years	OO
ago	,O
and	OO
we've	OO
since	OO
gone	OO
on	OO
and	OO
done	OO
many	OO
other	OO
experiments	.O
most	OU
of	OO
the	OO
dogs	OO
in	OO
these	OO
pictures	,O
are	OO
still	OO
working	OO
with	OO
us	OO
in	OO
the	OO
project	.O
we've	OU
done	OO
things	OO
looking	OO
at	OO
how	OO
their	OO
olfaction	,O
or	OO
their	OO
sensory	OO
system	OO
for	OO

how	OO
they	OO

people	,O
and	OO
other	OO
dogs	OO
in	OO
their	OO
household	OO
by	OO
smell	.O
one	OU
of	OO
the	OO
things	OO
that	OO
we	OO
found	OO
is	OO
that	OO
this	OO
reward	OO
system	,O
the	OO
same	OO
part	OO
of	OO
the	OO
brain	OO
activates	OO
when	OO
the	OO
dogs	OO
smell	OO
a	OO
familiar	OO
human	,O
even	OO
if	OO
the	OO
human	OO
is	OO
not	OO
there	.O
it	OU
shows	OO
that	OO
dogs	OO
have	OO
representations	OO
of	OO
us	OO
of	OO
our	OO
identities	OO
that	OO
persist	OO
when	OO
we	OO

when	OU
people	OO
ask	OO
me	,O
do	OU
dogs	OO
miss	OO
us	OO
when	OO
we	OO
are	OO
gone	?O
i	OU
have	OO
to	OO
say	OO
yes	OO
because	OO
we	OO
find	OO
evidence	OO
that	OO
they	OO
are	OO
remembering	OO
their	OO
humans	,O
that	OO
they	OO
care	OO
about	OO
them	,O
and	OO
that	OO
it's	OO

with	OO
these	OO

is	OU
it	OO
still	OO
just	OO
hot	OO
dogs	?O
to	OU
answer	OO
this	OO
question	,O
one	OO
of	OO
the	OO
other	OO
things	OO
that	OO
we	OO
did	OO
was	OO
we	OO
actually	OO
repeated	OO
the	OO
experiment	OO
i	OU
showed	OO
you	,O
where	OO
we	OO
show	OO
the	OO
different	OO
hand	OO
signals	.O
with	OU
one	OO
little	OO
twist:	OO
we	OO
manipulate	OO
who	OO
gives	OO
the	OO
signals	.O
does	OU
it	OO
matter	OO
if	OO
the	OO
dog's	OO
owner	OO
gives	OO
a	OO
signal	?O
or	OU
whether	OO
a	OO
stranger	OO
comes	OO
in	OO
and	OO
gives	OO
the	OO
signal	?O
or	OU
even	OO
whether	OO
a	OO
computer	OO
gives	OO
the	OO
signal	?O
because	OU
if	OO
you	OO
believe	OO
pavlov	,U
and	OO
all	OO
the	OO
behaviorist	OO
who	OO
followed	OO
him	,O
it	OO
really	OO
shouldn't	OO
matter	,O
because	OO
any	OO
signal	OO
that	OO
indicates	OO
an	OO
upcoming	OO
food	OO
treat	OO
is	OO
all	OO
the	OO
same	,O
if	OO
animals	OO
and	OO
dogs	OO
are	OO
just	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
robots	.O
but	OU
in	OO
fact	,O
we	OO
did	OO
find	OO
a	OO
difference	.O
what's	OU
very	OO
interesting	OO
about	OO
it	OO
is	OO
that	OO
not	OO
all	OO
dogs	OO
are	OO
the	OO
same	.O
for	OU
example	,O
my	OO
dog	OO
callie	OU
had	OO
a	OO
much	OO
greater	OO
response	OO
in	OO
that	OO
part	OO
of	OO
the	OO
brain	OO
when	OO
a	OO
stranger	OO
gave	OO
the	OO
signals	OO
or	OO
even	OO
a	OO
computer	OO
as	OO
opposed	OO
to	OO
me	.O
other	OU
dogs	OO
in	OO
the	OO
project	,O
some	OO
of	OO
the	OO
golden	OO
retrievers	OO
in	OO
the	OO
labs	OO
can	OO
have	OO
had	OO
the	OO
opposite	OO
pattern	,O
where	OO
their	OO
owners	OO
had	OO
really	OO
elicited	OO
the	OO
strongest	OO
brain	OO
response	.O
this	OU
is	OO
very	OO
interesting	OO
because	OO
what	OO
it	OO
does	OO
is	OO
it	OO
provides	OO
us	OO
with	OO
a	OO
neural	OO
biomarker	OO
of	OO
the	OO
dog's	OO
personality	OO
profile	.O
in	OU
fact	,O
what	OO
we've	OO
done	OO
is	OO
we've	OO
spun	OO
off	OO
a	OO
new	OO
project	OO
which	OO
we're	OO
very	OO
excited	OO
about	.O
we've	OU
partnered	OO
with	OO
canine	OU
companions	OU
for	OO
independence	,U
which	OO
is	OO
the	OO
largest	OO
service	OO
dog	OO
training	OO
organization	OO
in	OO
the	OO
united	OU
states	.U
if	OU
you	OO
know	OO
anything	OO
about	OO
service	OO
dogs	,O
they're	OO
incredibly	OO
difficult	OO
to	OO
train	.O
it's	OU
very	OO
expensive	,O
and	OO
there's	OO
a	OO
very	OO
low	OO
success	OO
rate	.O
roughly	OU
about	OO
35%	OO
of	OO
dogs	OO
that	OO
enter	OO
these	OO
programs	OO
to	OO
train	OO
to	OO
be	OO
assistance	OO
dogs	OO
will	OO
succeed;	OO
the	OO
other	OO
2/3	OO
end	OO
up	OO
being	OO
released	OO
and	OO
adopted	OO
to	OO
their	OO
puppy	OO
raisers	.O
so	OU
we've	OO
partnered	OO
with	OO
cci	,U
and	OO
they're	OO
actually	OO
training	OO
their	OO
dogs	OO
to	OO
do	OO
the	OO
mri	OU
procedure	.O
what	OU
we're	OO
going	OO
to	OO
do	OO
is	OO
try	OO
to	OO
predict	OO
which	OO
of	OO
those	OO
dogs	OO
will	OO
actually	OO
be	OO
good	OO
service	OO
dogs	.O
i	OU
really	OO
love	OO
this	OO
project	OO
because	OO
it	OO
shows	OO
that	OO
even	OO
though	OO
we	OO
started	OO
this	OO
just	OO
as	OO
my	OO
silly	OO
example	OO
of	OO
trying	OO
to	OO
understand	OO
what	OO
my	OO
dogs	OO
think	,O
and	OO
whether	OO
they	OO
love	OO
me	,O
it's	OO
actually	OO
gotten	OO
much	OO
bigger	.O
dogs	OU
are	OO
special	.O
they're	OU
the	OO
first	OO
domesticated	OO
animals	.O
they	OU
have	OO
been	OO
with	OO
humans	OO
since	OO
humans	OO
have	OO
been	OO
humans	.O
when	OU
we	OO
look	OO
at	OO
their	OO
brains	,O
it's	OO
almost	OO
like	OO
we	OO
are	OO
looking	OO
back	OO
in	OO
time	,O
and	OO
it's	OO
giving	OO
us	OO
a	OO

it's	OO
my	OO

once	OO
in	OO
a	OO
while	,O
two	OO
of	OO
these	OO
things	OO
will	OO
collide	OO
with	OO
each	OO
other	OO
or	OO
one	OO
of	OO
these	OO
things	OO
will	OO
explode	,O
or	OO
even	OO
worse	,O
somebody	OO
might	OO
just	OO
happen	OO
to	OO
destroy	OO
one	OO
of	OO
their	OO
satellites	OO
on	OO

many	,O
many	OO
more	OO
pieces	,O
most	OO
of	OO
which	OO
also	OO
never	OO
come	OO
back	.O
now	OU
these	OO
things	OO
are	OO
not	OO
just	OO

there	OO
are	OO

where	OO
we	OO
put	OO
some	OO
of	OO
these	OO

—	OO
think	OO
of	OO
these	OO
as	OO
space	OO
highways	.O
very	OU
much	OO
like	OO
highways	OO
on	OO
earth	,O
these	OO
space	OO
highways	OO
can	OO
only	OO
take	OO
up	OO
a	OO
maximum	OO
capacity	OO
of	OO
traffic	OO
to	OO
sustain	OO
space	OO
safe	OO
operations	.O
unlike	OU
highways	OO
on	OO

there	OO
are	OO
actually	OO
no	OO
space	OO
traffic	OO
rules	.O
none	OU
whatsoever	,O
ok	?U
wow	.U
what	OU
could	OO
possibly	OO
go	OO
wrong	OO
with	OO
that	?O
now	,U
what	OO
would	OO
be	OO
really	OO
nice	OO
is	OO
if	OO
we	OO
had	OO
something	OO
like	OO
a	OO
space	OO
traffic	OO
map	,O
like	OO
a	OO
waze	OU
for	OO
space	OO
that	OO
i	OU
could	OO
look	OO
up	OO
and	OO
see	OO
what	OO
the	OO
current	OO
traffic	OO
conditions	OO
are	OO
in	OO
space	,O
maybe	OO
even	OO
predict	OO
these	.O
the	OU
problem	OO
with	OO
that	,O
however	,O
is	OO
that	OO
ask	OO
five	OO
different	OO
people	,O
what's	OU
going	OO
on	OO
in	OO
orbit	?O
where	OU
are	OO
things	OO
going	?O
and	OO
you're	OO
probably	OO
going	OO
to	OO
get	OO
10	OO
different	OO
answers	.O
why	OU
is	OO
that	?O
it's	OU
because	OO
information	OO
about	OO
things	OO
on	OO
orbit	OO
is	OO
not	OO
commonly	OO
shared	OO
either	.O
so	OU
what	OO
if	OO
we	OO
had	OO
a	OO
globally	OO
accessible	,O
open	OO
and	OO
transparent	OO
space	OO
traffic	OO
information	OO
system	OO
that	OO
can	OO
inform	OO
the	OO
public	OO
of	OO
where	OO
everything	OO
is	OO
located	OO
to	OO
try	OO
to	OO
keep	OO
space	OO
safe	OO
and	OO
sustainable	?O
and	OU
what	OO
if	OO
the	OO
system	OO
could	OO
be	OO
used	OO
to	OO
form	OO
evidence	OO
based	OO
norms	OO
of	OO
behavior	OO
—	OO
these	OO

it	OO

but	OU
back	OO
to	OO
my	OO
problem	OO
of	OO
space	OO

map:	OO
what	OU
if	OO
you	OO
only	OO
had	OO
information	OO
from	OO
the	OO
us	OU

well	,U
in	OO
that	OO
case	,O
that's	OO
what	OO
your	OO

would	OO
look	OO

but	OU
what	OO

the	OO
russians	OU

that	OU
looks	OO
significantly	OO

who's	OU
right	?O
who's	OU

what	OU
should	OO
i	OU
believe	?O
what	OU

i	OU

this	OU
is	OO
part	OO
of	OO
the	OO
issue	.O
in	OU
the	OO
absence	OO
of	OO
this	OO

to	OO

to	OO

of	OO
the	OO
president	OO
as	OO

of	OO
state	OO
of	OO
the	OO

i	OU

four	OU
years	OO
earlier	,O
i	OU
was	OO
one	OO
of	OO
30	OO
heavily	OO
armed	OO
military	OO
officers	,O
all	OO
in	OO
our	OO
20s	,O
who	OO
had	OO
driven	OO
from	OO
the	OO
war	OO
front	OO
into	OO
the	OO
capital	OO
city	,O
freetown	.U
we	OU
had	OO
only	OO
one	OO
objective:	OO
to	OO
overthrow	OO
a	OO
corrupt	,O
repressive	OO
and	OO
single	OO
party	OO
dictatorship	OO
that	OO
had	OO
kept	OO
itself	OO
in	OO
power	OO
for	OO
over	OO
25	OO
years	.O
but	OU
in	OO
the	OO
end	,O
it	OO
wasn't	OO
a	OO
violent	OO
coup	.O
after	OU
we	OO
fired	OO
a	OO
few	OO
shots	OO
and	OO
seized	OO
the	OO
radio	OO
station	,O
hundreds	OO
of	OO
thousands	OO
of	OO
citizens	OO
jumped	OO
onto	OO
the	OO
streets	OO
to	OO
welcome	OO
us	OO
as	OO
liberators	.O
if	OU
you	OO
are	OO
thinking	OO
this	OO
seems	OO
like	OO
a	OO
movie	OO
script	,O
i'm	OU
with	OO
you	.O
i	OU
was	OO
part	OO
of	OO
the	OO
ruling	OO
military	OO
government	,O
and	OO
i	OU
served	OO
in	OO
several	OO
roles	.O
our	OU
goal	OO
was	OO
always	OO
to	OO
return	OO
the	OO
country	OO
to	OO
democratic	OO
civilian	OO
rule	.O
but	OU
after	OO
four	OO
years	,O
those	OO
multiparty	OO
democratic	OO
elections	OO
had	OO
still	OO
not	OO
happened	.O
citizens	OU
were	OO
beginning	OO
to	OO
lose	OO
faith	OO
in	OO
our	OO
promise	.O
but	OU
you	OO
know	OO
what	?O
i	OU
like	OO
to	OO
keep	OO
my	OO
promises	.O
some	OU
of	OO
my	OO
comrades	OO
and	OO
i	OU
staged	OO
another	OO
military	OO
coup	,O
and	OO
this	OO
time	,O
against	OO
our	OO
own	OO
head	OO
of	OO
state	OO
and	OO
commander	.O
again	,U
it	OO
was	OO
a	OO
bloodless	OO
coup	.O
that	OU
is	OO
how	OO
i	OU
became	OO
the	OO
new	OO
military	OO
head	OO
of	OO
state	OO
on	OO
january	OU
16	,O
1996	.O
i	OU
was	OO
still	OO
only	OO
31	OO
years	OO
old	.O
of	OU
course	,O
power	OO
was	OO
sweet	.O
i	OU
felt	OO
invulnerable	.O
i	OU
had	OO
thousands	OO
of	OO
heavily	OO
armed	OO
men	OO
and	OO
aircraft	OO
at	OO
my	OO
command	.O
i	OU
was	OO
heavily	OO
protected	,O
and	OO
i	OU
lived	OO
in	OO
luxury	.O
but	OU
my	OO
obligations	OO
to	OO
my	OO
nation	OO
were	OO
always	OO
superior	.O
millions	OU
of	OO
fellow	OO
citizens	OO
were	OO
either	OO
displaced	OO
or	OO
fleeing	OO
the	OO
violence	OO
and	OO
pillage	OO
of	OO
war	.O
so	OU
i	OU
engaged	OO
in	OO
a	OO
series	OO
of	OO
diplomatic	OO
activities	OO
right	OO
across	OO
the	OO
subregion	OO
and	OO
convinced	OO
the	OO
reclusive	OO
rebel	OO
leader	OO
to	OO
initiate	OO
peace	OO
talks	OO
for	OO
the	OO
very	OO
first	OO
time	.O
i	OU
also	OO
called	OO
a	OO
national	OO
consultative	OO
conference	OO
of	OO
civil	OO
society	OO
organizations	OO
and	OO
stakeholders	OO
to	OO
advise	OO
on	OO
the	OO
best	OO
way	OO
forward	.O
in	OU
both	OO
cases	,O
i	OU
shared	OO
with	OO
them	OO
what	OO
i	OU
believed	OO
in	OO
then	OO
and	OO
now:	OO
that	OO
sierra	OU
leone	OU
is	OO
bigger	OO
than	OO
all	OO
of	OO
us	,O
and	OO
that	OO
sierra	OU
leone	OU
must	OO
be	OO
a	OO
secure	,O
peaceful	OO
and	OO
just	OO
society	OO
where	OO
every	OO
person	OO
can	OO
thrive	OO
and	OO
contribute	OO
to	OO
national	OO
development	.O
and	OU
so	,O
i	OU
initiated	OO
peace	OO
talks	OO
with	OO
the	OO
rebels	.O
i	OU
organized	OO
the	OO
first	OO
multiparty	OO
democratic	OO
elections	OO
in	OO
nearly	OO
30	OO
years	.O
i	OU
handed	OO
over	OO
power	OO
to	OO
the	OO
newly	OO

i	OU
retired	OO
from	OO
the	OO

i	OU
left	OO
my	OO
country	OO
for	OO
the	OO
united	OU

to	OO
study	OO
—	OO
all	OO
in	OO
three	OO

in	OU
many	OO
a	OO

i	OU
wondered	OO
how	OO
we	OO

get	OO
it	OO
right	OO
again	OO
as	OO
a	OO
nation	.O
more	OU
than	OO
20	OO

later	,O
in	OO
april	OU
2018	,O
with	OO
a	OO
few	OO
more	OO
wrinkles	OO
and	OO
grey	OO

i	OU
was	OO
again	OO
head	OO
of	OO

but	OU
guess	OO
what	?O
this	OU
time	OO
i	OU
have	OO
been	OO
democratically	OO
elected	.O
at	OU
the	OO

last	OO

my	OO
three	OO

at	OU
that	OO

with	OO
my	OO

in	OO
both	OO

if	OO
i	OU

of	OO
the	OO

that	OO

of	OO
other	OO

that	OO

that	OU

what	OO

all	OO
about:	OO
a	OO
mission	OO

listen	OO
with	OO

to	OO
the	OO

of	OO

the	OO

of	OO
a	OO

for	OO
a	OO
chance	OO
to	OO
be	OO
better	OO

to	OO

our	OO

better	.O
it	OU
is	OO
about	OO
letting	OO
them	OO

that	OO

it	OU

about	OO

asking	,O
why	OU
not	?O
when	OO
they	OO

it	OU

about	OO

to	OO
me	OO
that	OO

each	OO

looking	OO
for	OO

as	OU
a	OO

my	OO
goal	OO
was	OO
to	OO
sort	OO
through	OO
everyone	OO
that	OO
i	OU
met	OO
and	OO
make	OO
a	OO
quick	OO
determination	OO
about	OO
which	OO
ones	OO
had	OO
the	OO
potential	OO
to	OO
make	OO
something	OO
really	OO
big	.O
but	OU
what	OO
makes	OO
a	OO
great	OO
founder	?O
this	OU
is	OO
a	OO
question	OO
i	OU
ask	OO
myself	OO
daily	.O
some	OU

based	OO
on	OO
a	OO

this	OO

and	OO
build	OO

across	OO

clients	?O
i	OU
have	OO
a	OO
different	OO
methodology	OO
to	OO
assess	OO
start	OO
up	OO
founders	,O
though	,O
and	OO
it's	OO
not	OO
complicated	.O
i	OU
look	OO
for	OO
signs	OO
of	OO
one	OO
specific	OO
trait	.O
not	OU
iq	,U
not	OO
eq	.U
it's	OU
adaptability:	OO
how	OO
well	OO
a	OO
person	OO
reacts	OO
to	OO
the	OO
inevitability	OO
of	OO
change	,O
and	OO
lots	OO
of	OO
it	.O
that's	OU
the	OO
single	OO
most	OO
important	OO
determinant	OO
for	OO
me	.O
i	OU
subscribe	OO
to	OO
the	OO
belief	OO
that	OO
adaptability	OO
itself	OO
is	OO
a	OO
form	OO
of	OO
intelligence	,O
and	OO
our	OO
adaptability	OO
quotient	,O
or	OO
aq	,U
is	OO
something	OO
that	OO
can	OO
be	OO
measured	,O
tested	OO
and	OO
improved	.O
aq	OU
isn't	OO
just	OO
useful	OO
for	OO
start	OO
up	OO
founders	,O
however	.O
i	OU
think	OO
it's	OO
increasingly	OO
important	OO
for	OO
all	OO
of	OO
us	.O
because	OU
the	OO
world	OO
is	OO
speeding	OO
up	.O
we	OU
know	OO
that	OO
the	OO
rate	OO
of	OO
technological	OO
change	OO
is	OO
accelerating	,O
which	OO
is	OO
forcing	OO
our	OO
brains	OO
to	OO
react	.O
whether	OU
you're	OO
navigating	OO
changing	OO
job	OO
conditions	OO
brought	OO
on	OO
by	OO
automation	,O
shifting	OO
geopolitics	OO
in	OO
a	OO
more	OO
globalized	OO
world	,O
or	OO
simply	OO
changing	OO
family	OO
dynamics	OO
and	OO
personal	OO
relationships	.O
each	OU
of	OO
us	,O
as	OO
individuals	,O
groups	,O
corporations	OO
and	OO
even	OO
governments	OO
are	OO
being	OO
forced	OO
to	OO
grapple	OO
with	OO
more	OO
change	OO
than	OO
ever	OO
before	OO
in	OO
human	OO
history	.O
so	,U
how	OO
do	OO
we	OO
assess	OO
our	OO
adaptability	?O
i	OU
use	OO
three	OO
tricks	OO
when	OO
meeting	OO
with	OO
founders	.O
here's	OU
the	OO
first	.O
think	OU
back	OO
to	OO
your	OO
most	OO
recent	OO
job	OO
interview	.O
what	OU
kind	OO
of	OO
questions	OO
were	OO
you	OO
asked	?O
probably	OU
some	OO
variation	OO
of	,O
tell	OU
me	OO
about	OO
a	OO
time	OO
when	,O
right	?O
instead	,U
to	OO
interview	OO
for	OO
adaptability	,O
i	OU
like	OO
to	OO
ask	OO
what	OO
if	OO
questions	.O
what	OU
if	OO
your	OO
main	OO
revenue	OO
stream	OO
were	OO
to	OO
dry	OO
up	OO
overnight	?O
what	OU
if	OO
a	OO
heat	OO
wave	OO
prevented	OO
every	OO
single	OO
customer	OO
from	OO
being	OO
able	OO
to	OO
visit	OO
your	OO
store	?O
asking	OU
what	OO
if	,O
instead	OO
of	OO
asking	OO
about	OO
the	OO
past	,O
forces	OO
the	OO
brain	OO
to	OO
simulate	.O
to	OU
picture	OO
multiple	OO
possible	OO
versions	OO
of	OO
the	OO
future	.O
the	OU
strength	OO
of	OO
that	OO
vision	,O
as	OO
well	OO
as	OO
how	OO
many	OO
distinct	OO
scenarios	OO
someone	OO
can	OO
conjure	,O
tells	OO
me	OO
a	OO
lot	.O
practicing	OU
simulations	OO
is	OO
a	OO
sort	OO
of	OO
safe	OO
testing	OO
ground	OO
for	OO
improving	OO
adaptability	.O
instead	OU
of	OO
testing	OO
how	OO
you	OO
take	OO
in	OO
and	OO
retain	OO
information	,O
like	OO
an	OO
iq	OU
test	OO
might	,O
it	OO
tests	OO
how	OO
you	OO
manipulate	OO
information	,O
given	OO
a	OO
constraint	,O
in	OO
order	OO
to	OO
achieve	OO
a	OO
specific	OO
goal	.O
the	OU
second	OO
trick	OO
that	OO
i	OU
use	OO
to	OO
assess	OO
adaptability	OO
in	OO
founders	OO
is	OO
to	OO
look	OO
for	OO
signs	OO
of	OO
unlearning	.O
active	OU
unlearners	OO
seek	OO
to	OO
challenge	OO
what	OO
they	OO
presume	OO
to	OO
already	OO
know	,O
and	OO
instead	,O
override	OO
that	OO
data	OO
with	OO
new	OO
information	.O
kind	OU
of	OO
like	OO
a	OO
computer	OO
running	OO
a	OO
disk	OO
cleanup	.O
take	OU
the	OO
example	OO
of	OO
destin	OU
sandlin	,U
who	OO
programed	OO
his	OO
bicycle	OO
to	OO
turn	OO
left	OO
when	OO
he	OO
steered	OO
it	OO
right	OO
and	OO
vice	OO
versa	.O
he	OU
called	OO
this	OO
his	OO
backwards	OU
brain	OU
bike	,U
and	OO
it	OO
took	OO
him	OO
nearly	OO
eight	OO
months	OO
just	OO
to	OO
learn	OO
how	OO
to	OO
ride	OO
it	OO
kind	OO
of	,O
sort	OO
of	OO
normally	.O
the	OU
fact	OO
that	OO
destin	OU
was	OO
able	OO
to	OO
unlearn	OO
his	OO
regular	OO
bike	OO
in	OO
favor	OO
of	OO
a	OO
new	OO
one	,O
though	,O
signals	OO
something	OO
awesome	OO
about	OO
our	OO
adaptability	.O
it's	OU
not	OO
fixed	.O
instead	,U
each	OO
of	OO
us	OO
has	OO
the	OO
capacity	OO
to	OO
improve	OO
it	,O
through	OO
dedication	OO
and	OO
hard	OO
work	.O
on	OU
the	OO
last	OO
page	OO
of	OO
gandhi's	OU
autobiography	,O
he	OO
wrote	,O
i	OU
must	OO
reduce	OO
myself	OO
to	OO
zero	.O
at	OU
many	OO
points	OO
in	OO
his	OO
very	OO
full	OO
life	,O
he	OO
was	OO
still	OO
seeking	OO
to	OO
return	OO
to	OO
a	OO
beginner's	OO
mindset	,O
to	OO
zero	.O
to	OU
unlearn	.O
in	OU
this	OO
way	,O
i	OU
think	OO
it's	OO
pretty	OO
safe	OO
to	OO
say	OO
gandhi	OU
had	OO
a	OO
high	OO
aq	OU
score	.O
the	OU
third	OO
and	OO
final	OO
trick	OO
that	OO
i	OU
use	OO
to	OO
assess	OO
a	OO
founder's	OO
adaptability	OO
is	OO
to	OO
look	OO
for	OO
people	OO
who	OO
infuse	OO
exploration	OO
into	OO
their	OO
life	OO
and	OO
their	OO
business	.O
there's	OU
a	OO
sort	OO
of	OO
natural	OO
tension	OO
between	OO
exploration	OO
and	OO
exploitation	.O
and	OU
collectively	,O
all	OO
of	OO
us	OO
tend	OO
to	OO
overvalue	OO
exploitation	.O
here's	OU
what	OO
i	OU
mean	.O
in	OU
the	OO
year	OO
2000	,O
a	OO
man	OO
finagled	OO
his	OO
way	OO
into	OO
a	OO
meeting	OO
with	OO
john	OU
antioco	,U
the	OO
ceo	OU
of	OO
blockbuster	,U
and	OO
proposed	OO
a	OO
partnership	OO
to	OO
manage	OO
blockbuster's	OU
fledgling	OO
online	OO
business	.O
the	OU
ceo	OU
john	OU
laughed	OO
him	OO
out	OO
of	OO
the	OO
room	,O
saying	,O
i	OU
have	OO
millions	OO
of	OO
existing	OO
customers	OO
and	OO
thousands	OO
of	OO
successful	OO
retail	OO
stores	.O
i	OU
really	OO
need	OO
to	OO
focus	OO
on	OO
the	OO
money	.O
the	OU
other	OO
man	OO
in	OO
the	OO
meeting	,O
however	,O
turned	OO
out	OO
to	OO
be	OO
reed	OU
hastings	,U
the	OO
ceo	OU
of	OO
netflix	.U
in	OU
2018	,O
netflix	OU
brought	OO
in	OO
15.8	OO
billion	OO
dollars	,O
while	OO
blockbuster	OU
filed	OO
for	OO
bankruptcy	OO
in	OO
2010	,O
directly	OO
10	OO
years	OO
after	OO
that	OO
meeting	.O
the	OU
blockbuster	OU
ceo	OU
was	OO
too	OO
focused	OO
on	OO
exploiting	OO
his	OO
already	OO
successful	OO
business	OO
model	,O
so	OO
much	OO
so	OO
that	OO
he	OO
couldn't	OO
see	OO
around	OO
the	OO
next	OO
corner	.O
in	OU
that	OO
way	,O
his	OO
previous	OO
success	OO
became	OO
the	OO
enemy	OO
of	OO
his	OO
adaptability	OO
potential	.O
for	OU
the	OO
founders	OO
that	OO
i	OU
work	OO
with	,O
i	OU
frame	OO
exploration	OO
as	OO
a	OO
state	OO
of	OO
constant	OO
seeking	.O
to	OU
never	OO
fall	OO
too	OO
far	OO
in	OO
love	OO
with	OO
your	OO
wins	OO
but	OO
rather	OO
continue	OO
to	OO
proactively	OO
seek	OO
out	OO
what	OO
might	OO
kill	OO
you	OO
next	.O
when	OU
i	OU
first	OO
started	OO
exploring	OO
adaptability	,O
the	OO
thing	OO
i	OU
found	OO
most	OO
exciting	OO
is	OO
that	OO
we	OO
can	OO
improve	OO
it	.O
each	OU
of	OO
us	OO
has	OO
the	OO
capacity	OO
to	OO
become	OO
more	OO
adaptable	.O
but	OU
think	OO
of	OO
it	OO
like	OO
a	OO
muscle:	OO
it's	OO
got	OO
to	OO
be	OO
exercised	.O
and	OU
don't	OO
get	OO
discouraged	OO
if	OO
it	OO
takes	OO
a	OO
while	.O
remember	OU
destin	OU
sandlin	?U
it	OU
took	OO
him	OO
eight	OO
months	OO
just	OO
to	OO
learn	OO
how	OO
to	OO
ride	OO
a	OO
bike	.O
over	OU
time	,O
using	OO
the	OO
tricks	OO
that	OO
i	OU
use	OO
on	OO
founders	OO
—	OO
asking	OO

today	OO
about	OO
an	OO
orca	OO
named	OO
tahlequah	.U
tahlequah	OU
is	OO
also	OO
known	OO
as	OO
j35	OU
to	OO
scientists	,O
because	OO
she	OO
swims	OO
with	OO
the	OO
j	OU
pod	OU
in	OO
the	OO
salish	OU
sea	.U
these	OU
are	OO
the	OO
waters	OO
off	OO
of	OO
british	OU

washington	OU
state	.U
now	,U
last	OO
year	,O
in	OO
july	OU
2018	,O
she	OO
was	OO
well	OO
along	OO
in	OO
her	OO
17	OO
month	OO
pregnancy	,O
and	OO
scientists	OO
were	OO
very	OO
excited	OO
because	OO
no	OO
baby	OO
had	OO
survived	OO
in	OO
this	OO
pod	OO
for	OO
three	OO
long	OO
years	.O
now	,U
orcas	OO
are	OO
also	OO
known	OO
as	OO
killer	OO
whales	.O
they're	OU
profoundly	OO
social	OO
and	OO
profoundly	OO
intelligent	OO
beings	.O
and	OU
scientists	OO
are	OO
very	OO
interested	OO
in	OO
their	OO
behavior	,O
because	OO
in	OO
their	OO
social	OO
networks	,O
they	OO
share	OO
habits	,O
information	OO
and	OO
even	OO
affection	.O
they	OU
create	OO
true	OO
cultures	OO
of	OO
the	OO
ocean	.O
but	OU
this	OO
pod	OO
has	OO
been	OO
in	OO
trouble	.O
the	OU
chinook	OU
salmon	OO
that	OO
the	OO
orcas	OO
favor	OO
has	OO
been	OO
way	OO
down	OO
in	OO
the	OO
region	,O
and	OO
pollution	OO
has	OO
been	OO
up	.O
but	OU
on	OO
july	OU
24th	,O
tahlequah	OU
gave	OO
birth	OO
to	OO
a	OO
daughter	,O
and	OO
scientists	OO
were	OO
so	OO
excited	OO
by	OO
this	OO
development	.O
but	OU
unfortunately	,O
the	OO
same	OO
day	OO
—	OO
in	OO
fact	,O
shortly	OO
after	OO
birth	OO
—	OO
the	OO
calf	OO
died	.O
well	,U
what	OO
happened	OO
next	OO
electrified	OO
animal	OO
lovers	OO
across	OO
the	OO
world	,O
because	OO
tahlequah	OU
refused	OO
to	OO
let	OO
her	OO
baby	OO
slip	OO
off	OO
into	OO
the	OO
water	.O
she	OU
kept	OO
it	OO
on	OO
her	OO
body	OO
and	OO
she	OO
swam	OO
with	OO
it	.O
if	OU
it	OO
did	OO
fall	OO
off	,O
she	OO
would	OO
dive	OO
and	OO
rescue	OO
it	,O
and	OO
she	OO
battled	OO
stiff	OO
currents	OO
to	OO
do	OO
this	.O
now	,U
she	OO
kept	OO
this	OO
behavior	OO
up	OO
for	OO
17	OO
days	,O
and	OO
during	OO
this	OO
time	,O
she	OO
swam	OO
over	OO
1,000	OO
miles	.O
at	OU
that	OO
point	,O
she	OO
let	OO
the	OO
little	OO
baby	OO
slip	OO
off	OO
into	OO
the	OO
water	.O
so	OU
today	,O
tahlequah	OU
swims	OO
on	OO
with	OO
the	OO
j	OU
pod	,U
but	OO
her	OO
grief	OO
still	OO
moves	OO
me	.O
and	OU
i	OU
do	OO
believe	OO
that	OO
grief	OO
is	OO
the	OO
right	OO
word	OO
to	OO
use	.O
i	OU
believe	OO
that	OO
grief	OO
is	OO
the	OO
right	OO
word	OO
to	OO
use	OO
for	OO
numerous	OO
animals	OO
who	OO
mourn	OO
the	OO
dead	.O
they	OU
may	OO
be	OO
friends	OO
or	OO
mates	OO
or	OO
relatives	.O
because	OU
these	OO
visible	OO
cues	,O
these	OO
behavioral	OO
cues	,O
tell	OO
us	OO
something	OO
about	OO
an	OO
animal's	OO
emotional	OO
state	.O
now	,U
for	OO
the	OO
last	OO
seven	OO
years	,O
i've	OU
been	OO
working	OO
to	OO
document	OO
examples	OO
of	OO
animal	OO
grief	OO
—	OO
in	OO
birds	,O
in	OO
mammals	,O
in	OO
domesticated	OO
animals	OO
and	OO
in	OO
wild	OO
animals	OO
—	OO
and	OO
i	OU
believe	OO
in	OO
the	OO
reality	OO
of	OO
animal	OO
grief	.O
now	,U
i	OU
say	OO
it	OO
this	OO
way	OO
because	OO
i	OU
need	OO
to	OO
acknowledge	OO
to	OO
you	OO
right	OO
up	OO
front	OO
that	OO
not	OO
all	OO
scientists	OO
agree	OO
with	OO
me	.O
and	OU
part	OO
of	OO
the	OO
reason	,O
i	OU
think	,O
is	OO
because	OO
of	OO
what	OO
i	OU
call	OO
the	OO
a	OO
word	.O
the	OU
a	OO
word	OO
is	OO
anthropomorphism	,O
and	OO
historically	,O
it's	OO
been	OO
a	OO
big	OO
deterrent	OO
to	OO
recognizing	OO
animal	OO
emotions	.O
so	,U
anthropomorphism	OO
is	OO
when	OO
we	OO
project	OO
onto	OO
other	OO
animals	OO
our	OO
capacities	OO
or	OO
our	OO
emotions	.O
and	OU
we	OO
can	OO
all	OO
probably	OO
think	OO
of	OO
examples	OO
of	OO
this	.O
let's	OU
say	OO
we	OO
have	OO
a	OO
friend	OO
who	OO
tells	OO
us	,O
my	OU
cat	OO
understands	OO
everything	OO
i	OU
say	.O
or	,U
my	OU
dog	,O
he's	OO
so	OO
sweet	.O
he	OO
ran	OO
right	OO
across	OO
the	OO
yard	OO
this	OO
morning	OO
towards	OO
a	OO
squirrel	,O
and	OO
i	OU
know	OO
he	OO
just	OO
wants	OO
to	OO
play	.O
well	,U
maybe	.O
or	OU
maybe	OO
not	.O
i'm	OU
skeptical	OO
about	OO
claims	OO
like	OO
those	.O
but	OU
animal	OO
grief	OO
is	OO
different	,O
because	OO
we're	OO
not	OO
trying	OO
to	OO
read	OO
an	OO
animal's	OO
mind	.O
we're	OU
looking	OO
at	OO
visible	OO
cues	OO
of	OO
behavior	OO
and	OO
trying	OO
to	OO
interpret	OO
them	OO
with	OO
some	OO
meaning	.O
now	,U
it's	OO
true	OO
—	OO
scientists	OO
often	OO
push	OO
back	OO
at	OO
me	,O
and	OO
they'll	OO
say	,O
ah	,U
look	,O
the	OO
animal	OO
might	OO
be	OO
stressed	,O
or	OO
maybe	OO
the	OO
animal's	OO
just	OO
confused	OO
because	OO
his	OO
or	OO
her	OO
routine	OO
has	OO
been	OO
disrupted	.O
but	OU
i	OU
think	OO
that	OO
this	OO
overworry	OO
about	OO
anthropomorphism	OO
misses	OO
a	OO
fundamental	OO
point	.O
and	OU
that	OO
is	OO
that	OO
animals	OO
can	OO
care	OO
very	OO
deeply	OO
for	OO
each	OO
other	,O
maybe	OO
they	OO
even	OO
love	OO
each	OO
other	.O
and	OU
when	OO
they	OO
do	,O
a	OO
survivor's	OO
heart	OO
can	OO
be	OO
pierced	OO
by	OO
a	OO
death	.O
let's	OU
face	OO
it:	OO
if	OO
we	OO
deny	OO
evolutionary	OO
continuity	,O
we	OO
are	OO
really	OO
missing	OO
out	OO
on	OO
embracing	OO
part	OO
of	OO
ourselves	.O
so	OU
yes	,O
i	OU
believe	OO
in	OO
the	OO
reality	OO
of	OO
animal	OO
grief	,O
and	OO
i	OU
also	OO
think	OO
that	OO
if	OO
we	OO
recognize	OO
it	,O
we	OO
can	OO
make	OO
the	OO
world	OO
a	OO
better	OO
place	OO
for	OO
animals	,O
a	OO
kinder	OO
place	OO
for	OO
animals	.O
so	OU
let	OO
me	OO
tell	OO
you	OO
a	OO
little	OO
bit	OO
more	OO
about	OO
animal	OO
grief	.O
i'm	OU
going	OO
to	OO
start	OO
in	OO
kenya	.U
you	OU
see	OO
here	OO
there's	OO
an	OO
elephant	OO
named	OO
eleanor	OU
who	OO
came	OO
one	OO
day	OO
with	OO
bruised	OO
legs	,O
and	OO
she	OO
collapsed	.O
you	OU
see	OO
on	OO
the	OO
left	OO
that	OO
another	OO
female	OO
named	OO
grace	OU
came	OO
to	OO
her	OO
right	OO
away	OO
and	,O
using	OO
her	OO
own	OO
trunk	,O
propped	OO
her	OO
up	,O
tried	OO
to	OO
get	OO
her	OO
up	OO
on	OO
her	OO
feet	.O
and	OU
she	OO
did	OO
succeed	,O
but	OO
then	OO
eleanor	OU
collapsed	OO
again	.O
at	OU
this	OO
point	,O
grace	OU
became	OO
visibly	OO
distressed	,O
and	OO
she	OO
prodded	OO
the	OO
body	,O
and	OO
she	OO
vocalized	.O
eleanor	OU
collapsed	OO
again	,O
and	OO
unfortunately	,O
she	OO
did	OO
die	.O
what	OU
you	OO
see	OO
on	OO
the	OO
right	OO
is	OO
a	OO
female	OO
from	OO
another	OO
family	OO
named	OO
maui	,U
who	OO
came	OO
after	OO
the	OO
death	,O
and	OO
she	OO
stayed	OO
at	OO
the	OO
body	.O
she	OU
held	OO
a	OO
vigil	OO
there	,O
and	OO
she	OO
even	OO
rocked	OO
in	OO
distress	OO
over	OO
the	OO
body	.O
so	OU
the	OO
scientists	OO
watching	OO
the	OO
elephants	OO
kept	OO
close	OO
observation	OO
on	OO
eleanor's	OU
body	OO
for	OO
seven	OO
days	.O
and	OU
during	OO
those	OO
seven	OO
days	,O
a	OO
parade	OO
of	OO
elephants	OO
came	OO
from	OO
five	OO
different	OO
families	.O
now	,U
some	OO
were	OO
just	OO
curious	,O
but	OO
others	OO
carried	OO
out	OO
behaviors	OO
that	OO
i	OU
really	OO
believe	OO
should	OO
be	OO
classified	OO
as	OO
grief	.O
so	OU
what	OO
does	OO
grief	OO
look	OO
like	?O
it	OU
can	OO
be	OO
rocking	,O
as	OO
i	OU
said	,O
in	OO
distress	.O
it	OU
can	OO
also	OO
be	OO
social	OO
withdrawal	,O
when	OO
an	OO
animal	OO
just	OO
takes	OO
himself	OO
or	OO
herself	OO
away	OO
from	OO
friends	OO
and	OO
stays	OO
by	OO
themselves	,O
or	OO
a	OO
failure	OO
to	OO
eat	OO
or	OO
sleep	OO
properly	,O
sometimes	OO
a	OO
depressed	OO
posture	OO
or	OO
vocalization	.O
it	OU
can	OO
be	OO
very	OO
helpful	OO
for	OO
those	OO
of	OO
us	OO
studying	OO
this	OO
to	OO
be	OO
able	OO
to	OO
compare	OO
the	OO
behavior	OO
of	OO
a	OO
survivor	OO
before	OO
death	OO
and	OO
after	OO
death	,O
because	OO
that	OO
increases	OO
the	OO
rigor	OO
of	OO
our	OO
interpretation	.O
and	OU
i	OU
can	OO
explain	OO
this	OO
to	OO
you	OO
by	OO
talking	OO
about	OO
two	OO
ducks	OO
named	OO
harper	OU
and	OO
kohl	.U
so	OU
we're	OO
into	OO
birds	OO
now	.O
so	OU
harper	OU
and	OO
kohl	OU
were	OO
raised	OO
at	OO
a	OO
foie	OO
gras	OO
factory	,O
and	OO
they	OO
were	OO
treated	OO
cruelly	.O
foie	OU
gras	OO
does	OO
involve	OO
force	OO
feeding	OO
of	OO
birds	.O
so	OU
this	OO
hurt	OO
their	OO
bodies	,O
and	OO
their	OO
spirits	OO
were	OO
not	OO
in	OO
good	OO
shape	,O
either	.O
but	OU
thankfully	,O
they	OO
were	OO
rescued	OO
by	OO
a	OO
farm	OO
sanctuary	OO
in	OO
upstate	OO
new	OU
york	.U
and	OU
for	OO
four	OO
years	,O
they	OO
stabilized	,O
and	OO
they	OO
were	OO
fast	OO
friends	.O
they	OU
often	OO
took	OO
themselves	OO
to	OO
a	OO
small	OO
pond	OO
on	OO
the	OO
property	.O
then	,U
kohl	OU
started	OO
to	OO
have	OO
really	OO
intractable	OO
pain	OO
in	OO
his	OO
legs	,O
and	OO
it	OO
was	OO
clear	OO
to	OO
the	OO
sanctuary	OO
that	OO
he	OO
had	OO
to	OO
be	OO
euthanized	OO
humanely	,O
and	OO
he	OO
was	.O
but	OU
then	OO
the	OO
sanctuary	OO
workers	OO
did	OO
a	OO
brilliant	OO
thing	,O
because	OO
they	OO
brought	OO
harper	OU
to	OO
the	OO
body	OO
to	OO
see	.O
and	OU
at	OO
first	,O
harper	OU
prodded	OO
the	OO
body	OO
of	OO
his	OO
friend	,O
but	OO
then	OO
he	OO
laid	OO
himself	OO
over	OO
it	,O
and	OO
he	OO
stayed	OO
there	OO
for	OO
over	OO
an	OO
hour	OO
with	OO
his	OO
friend	.O
and	OU
in	OO
the	OO
weeks	OO
after	,O
he	OO
had	OO
a	OO
hard	OO
time	.O
he	OU
would	OO
go	OO
back	OO
to	OO
that	OO
same	OO
pond	OO
where	OO
he	OO
had	OO
been	OO
with	OO
kohl	,U
and	OO
he	OO
didn't	OO
want	OO
any	OO
other	OO
friends	.O
and	OU
within	OO
two	OO
months	,O
he	OO
died	OO
as	OO
well	.O
now	,U
i'm	OU
happy	OO
to	OO
say	OO
that	OO
not	OO
all	OO
grieving	OO
animals	OO
have	OO
this	OO
sorrowful	OO
outcome	.O
last	OU
summer	,O
i	OU
flew	OO
to	OO
boston	OU
to	OO
visit	OO
my	OO
adult	OO
daughter	,O
sarah	.U
i	OU
was	OO
with	OO
my	OO
husband	OO
charlie	.U
i	OU
really	OO
needed	OO
a	OO
break	OO
from	OO
work	.O
but	OU
i	OU
succumbed	,O
and	OO
i	OU
checked	OO
my	OO
work	OO
email	.O
you	OU
know	OO
how	OO
that	OO
is	.O
and	OU
there	OO
was	OO
a	OO
communication	OO
about	OO
a	OO
dejected	OO
donkey	.O
now	,U
as	OO
an	OO
anthropologist	,O
this	OO
wasn't	OO
what	OO
i	OU
expected	,O
but	OO
there	OO
it	OO
was	,O
and	OO
i'm	OU
glad	OO
i	OU
read	OO
it	.O
because	OU
a	OO
donkey	OO
named	OO
lena	OU
had	OO
gone	OO
to	OO
another	OO
farm	OO
sanctuary	,O
this	OO
one	OO
in	OO
alberta	,U
canada	,U
as	OO
the	OO
only	OO
donkey	OO
there	,O
and	OO
had	OO
trouble	OO
making	OO
friends	OO
for	OO
that	OO
reason	.O
but	OU
she	OO
eventually	OO
did	OO
make	OO
friends	OO
with	OO
an	OO
older	OO
horse	OO
named	OO
jake	,U
and	OO
for	OO
three	OO
years	OO
they	OO
were	OO
inseparable	.O
but	OU
the	OO
reason	OO
the	OO
email	OO
came	OO
was	OO
that	OO
jake	,U
at	OO
age	OO
32	,O
the	OO
horse	,O
had	OO
become	OO
gravely	OO
ill	OO
and	OO
had	OO
to	OO
be	OO
put	OO
down	,O
and	OO
this	OO
is	OO
what	OO
was	OO
going	OO
on	.O
this	OU
is	OO
lena	OU
standing	OO
on	OO
jake's	OU
grave	.O
she	OU
didn't	OO
want	OO
to	OO
come	OO
in	OO
at	OO
night	.O
she	OU
didn't	OO
want	OO
to	OO
come	OO
in	OO
for	OO
food	.O
she	OU
didn't	OO
want	OO
to	OO
come	OO
in	OO
for	OO
water	.O
she	OU
pawed	OO
at	OO
the	OO
grave	,O
she	OO
brayed	OO
in	OO
distress	,O
and	OO
there	OO
she	OO
stood	.O
so	OU
we	OO
talked	OO
and	OO
we	OO
brainstormed	.O
what	OU
do	OO
you	OO
do	OO
for	OO
an	OO
animal	OO
like	OO
this	?O
and	OU
we	OO
talked	OO
about	OO
the	OO
role	OO
of	OO
time	,O
of	OO
extra	OO
love	OO
and	OO
kindness	OO
from	OO
people	OO
and	OO
of	OO
urging	OO
her	OO
to	OO
make	OO
a	OO
new	OO
friend	.O
and	OU
here's	OO
where	OO
her	OO
trajectory	OO
does	OO
diverge	OO
from	OO
that	OO
of	OO
harper	OU
the	OO
duck	,O
because	OO
she	OO
did	OO
make	OO
a	OO
new	OO
friend	,O
and	OO
sanctuary	OO
workers	OO
wrote	OO
back	OO
and	OO
said	OO
it	OO
worked	OO
out	OO
well	.O
now	OU
sometimes	,O
scientists	OO
supplement	OO
observation	OO
with	OO
hormonal	OO
analysis	.O
there's	OU
an	OO
example	OO
of	OO
a	OO
group	OO
of	OO
scientists	OO
in	OO
botswana	,U
who	OO
took	OO
fecal	OO
material	OO
from	OO
baboons	OO
and	OO
compared	OO
two	OO
different	OO
groups	.O
the	OU
first	OO
group	OO
were	OO
females	OO
who	OO
had	OO
witnessed	OO
a	OO
predator	OO
attack	OO
and	OO
lost	OO
someone	OO
in	OO
that	OO
attack	,O
and	OO
the	OO
second	OO
group	OO
were	OO
females	OO
who	OO
had	OO
witnessed	OO
an	OO
attack	OO
but	OO
had	OO
not	OO
lost	OO
someone	.O
and	OU
the	OO
stress	OO
hormones	OO
were	OO
way	OO
up	OO
in	OO
that	OO
first	OO
group	.O
but	OU
here's	OO
the	OO
thing:	OO
the	OO
scientists	OO
didn't	OO
just	OO
call	OO
them	OO
stressed	OO
baboons	,O
they	OO
called	OO
them	OO
bereaved	OO
baboons	,O
and	OO
in	OO
part	,O
that's	OO
because	OO
of	OO
the	OO
observations	OO
that	OO

for	OU
example	,O
this	OO
mother	OO

were	OO
very	OO
close	,O
and	OO
then	OO
the	OO

was	OO
killed	OO
by	OO

the	OU
mother	OO
removed	OO
herself	OO
from	OO
all	OO
her	OO

from	OO
her	OO

just	OO
stayed	OO
by	OO
herself	OO
for	OO
weeks	OO
—	OO
bereavement	OO
—	OO
and	OO
she	OO
then	OO
slowly	OO
recovered	.O
so	OU
we	OO
have	OO
bereaved	OO
baboons	.O
will	OU
science	OO
tell	OO
us	OO
someday	OO
about	OO

will	OU
we	OO
hear	OO
about	OO
frogs	OO
who	OO
mourn	?O
i	OU
don't	OO
think	OO
so	,O
and	OO
i	OU
think	OO
the	OO
reason	OO
is	OO
because	OO
animals	OO
really	OO
need	OO
one	OO
to	OO
one	,O
close	OO
relationships	OO
for	OO
that	OO
to	OO
happen	.O
i	OU

i	OU

documented	OO

i	OU

with	OO
a	OO

who	OO

because	OO
her	OO

she	OU
said	OO
to	OO
me	,O
the	OU
first	OO
dog	OO
in	OO
the	OO
house	OO
has	OO
died	.O
the	OU
second	OO
animal	OO
does	OO
not	OO
seem	OO

the	OO
second	OO
dog	.O
what	OU
is	OO
wrong	OO
with	OO
him	?O
and	OU
as	OO
i	OU
listened	OO
to	OO
her	,O
i	OU
realized	OO
that	OO
this	OO
dog	OO
was	OO
now	OO
the	OO
only	OO
animal	OO
in	OO
the	OO

and	OO
as	OO

he	OO

that	OO

now	,U
in	OO
any	OO

we've	OO

we	OO

this	OU

we	OU

see	OO
that	OO
if	OO

there's	OO
tremendous	OO
plausibility	OO
to	OO
the	OO
notion	OO
that	OO

if	OO
we	OO

that	,O
here's	OO
how	OO
we	OO

start	OO
to	OO

about	OO
the	OO

we	OU

we	OO

they	OO

we	OO
know	OO
they	OO

we	OO

you	.O
we	OU
can	OO
look	OO
at	OO
elephants	OO

they	OO

and	OO
we	OO

renew	OO
our	OO

they	OO

they	OO

they	OO

you	OO

the	OO
ducks	OO

they	OO
tell	OO
us	OO
something	OO

they	OU
help	OO
us	OO
connect	OO

realize	OO
that	OO
what	OO

it's	OO

you	OO
the	OO

the	OU

that	OO

in	OU
the	OO
1950s	OO

60s	,O
psychedelic	OO
research	OO
flourished	OO
all	OO
over	OO
the	OO

for	OO

the	OO

leaked	OO
out	OO

by	OO

there	OO

a	OO

in	OO
1970	,O
the	OO
us	OU

criminalized	OO
all	OO

they	OO
began	OO

all	OO

this	OO

spread	OO
all	OO
over	OO
the	OO

lasted	OO
for	OO
decades	.O
and	OO
it	OO
was	OO
tragic	,O
since	OO
psychedelics	OO
are	OO
really	OO
just	OO
tools	,O
and	OO
whether	OO
their	OO

depends	OO
on	OO
how	OO
they're	OO
used	.O
psychedelic	OU
means	OO

and	OO
it	OO
relates	OO
to	OO

lsd	,U
psilocybin	,O

and	OO
other	OO
drugs	.O
when	OU

18	OO

i	OU

a	OO

i	OU
was	OO
experimenting	OO
with	OO

mescaline	,O
and	OO
these	OO

brought	OO
me	OO
in	OO

with	OO

they	OO
helped	OO
me	OO
have	OO
a	OO
spiritual	OO
connection	OO
that	OO
unfortunately	,O
my	OO
bar	OO

did	OO
not	OO
produce	.O
when	OU
i	OU
wanted	OO
to	OO
tease	OO
my	OO
parents	,O
i	OU
would	OO
tell	OO
them	OO
that	OO
they	OO
drove	OO
me	OO
to	OO
psychedelics	OO
because	OO
my	OO
bar	OO

had	OO
failed	OO
to	OO
turn	OO
me	OO
into	OO
a	OO
man	.O
but	OU
most	OO

psychedelics	OO
gave	OO
me	OO
this	OO
feeling	OO
of	OO
our	OO

humanity	,O
of	OO
our	OO
unity	OO
with	OO
all	OO

reported	OO
that	OO

felt	OO
that	OO

to	OO

her	OO

that	OO

taken	OO
therapeutically	,O
it	OO
can	OO
reduce	OO
the	OO

she	OO

during	OU

marcela	OU
was	OO

to	OO
process	OO
her	OO

more	OO
fluidly	,O
more	OO
easily	.O

yet	,O
she	OO
was	OO

to	OO
tell	OO

that	OO

keeping	OO
her	OO
a	OO

who	OO

that	OO

from	OO
those	OO

they	OU

a	OO
hyperactive	OO

they	OU
have	OO

where	OO
we	OO

they	OO

the	OO

in	OO
the	OO

mdma	OU
reduces	OO
activity	OO
in	OO
the	OO
amygdala	,O

the	OO

and	OO
increases	OO
connectivity	OO
between	OO
the	OO

the	OO

to	OO

to	OO

recently	,U
researchers	OO
at	OO
johns	OU

published	OO
a	OO
paper	OO
in	OO
nature	,U
in	OO
which	OO
they	OO
demonstrated	OO
that	OO
mdma	OU
releases	OO
oxytocin	,O
the	OO

of	OO

the	OU
same	OO
researchers	OO
also	OO
did	OO
studies	OO
in	OO
octopuses	,O
who	OO
are	OO
normally	OO
asocial	,O
unless	OO
it's	OO
mating	OO
season	.O
but	OU
lo	OO
and	OO
behold	,O
you	OO
give	OO
them	OO
mdma	,U
and	OO
they	OO
become	OO
prosocial	.O
several	OU
months	OO
after	OO
marcela	OU
and	OO
i	OU
worked	OO
together	,O
the	OO
drug	OU
enforcement	OU
administration	OU
moved	OO
to	OO
criminalize	OO
ecstasy	,U
having	OO
no	OO
knowledge	OO
of	OO
its	OO
therapeutic	OO
use	.O
so	OU
i	OU
went	OO
to	OO
washington	,U
and	OO
i	OU
went	OO
into	OO
the	OO
headquarters	OO
of	OO
the	OO
drug	OU
enforcement	OU
administration	,U
and	OO
i	OU
filed	OO
a	OO
lawsuit	OO
demanding	OO
a	OO
hearing	,O
at	OO
which	OO
psychiatrists	OO
and	OO
psychotherapists	OO
would	OO
be	OO
able	OO
to	OO
present	OO
information	OO
about	OO

use	OO
of	OO
mdma	OU
to	OO
try	OO
to	OO
keep	OO
it	OO
legal	.O
and	OU
in	OO
the	OO
middle	OO
of	OO
the	OO

the	OO
dea	OU

out	,O
declared	OO
an	OO

all	OO

so	OO
the	OO
only	OO

that	OO

was	OO
through	OO

the	OO

you	OO
talked	OO
about	OO
using	OO
these	OO

to	OO
address	OO
some	OO
pretty	OO
serious	OO

so	OU
what	OO
about	OO
some	OO
more	OO
common	OO
mental	OO
illnesses	OO
like	OO
anxiety	OO
and	OO
depression	,O
and	OO
is	OO
that	OO
where	OO
microdosing	OO
comes	OO
in	?O
rd:	OU
well	,U
microdosing	OO
can	OO
be	OO
helpful	OO
for	OO
depression	,O
i	OU
do	OO
know	OO
someone	OO
that	OO
has	OO
been	OO
using	OO
it	.O
but	OU
in	OO
general	,O
for	OO
therapeutic	OO
purposes	,O
we	OO
prefer	OO
macro	OO
dosing	OO
rather	OO
than	OO
microdosing	,O
in	OO
order	OO
to	OO
really	OO
help	OO
people	OO
deal	OO
with	OO
the	OO
root	OO

microdosing	OU
is	OO
more	OO
for	OO
creativity	,O
for	OO
artistic	OO
inspiration	,O
for	OO
focus	.O
and	OU
it	OO
also	OO
does	OO
have	OO
a	OO
mood	OO
elevation	OO
lift	.O
but	OU
i	OU
think	OO
for	OO
serious	OO

we'd	OO
rather	OO
not	OO
get	OO
people	OO
thinking	OO
that	OO
they	OO
need	OO
a	OO

do	OO
more	OO

we're	OO

our	OU

we	OU

i	OU
have	OO
a	OO
feeling	OO
i	OU

the	OO
answer	OO
to	OO

so	.O

you	OO
so	OO
much	,O
rick	.U
rd:	OU
thank	OU
you	.O
thank	OU
you	OO
all	.O
as	OU
a	OO
roboticist	,O
i	OU
get	OO
asked	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
questions	.O
when	OU
we	OO
will	OO
they	OO
start	OO
serving	OO
me	OO
breakfast	?O
so	OU
i	OU
thought	OO
the	OO
future	OO
of	OO
robotics	OO
would	OO
be	OO
looking	OO
more	OO
like	OO
us	.O
i	OU
thought	OO
they	OO
would	OO
look	OO
like	OO
me	,O
so	OO
i	OU
built	OO
eyes	OO
that	OO
would	OO
simulate	OO
my	OO
eyes	.O
i	OU
built	OO
fingers	OO
that	OO
are	OO
dextrous	OO
enough	OO
to	OO
serve	OO
me	.O
baseballs	.O
classical	OU
robots	OO
like	OO
this	OO
are	OO
built	OO
and	OO
become	OO
functional	OO
based	OO
on	OO
the	OO
fixed	OO
number	OO
of	OO
joints	OO
and	OO
actuators	.O
and	OU
this	OO
means	OO
their	OO
functionality	OO
and	OO
shape	OO
are	OO
already	OO
fixed	OO
at	OO
the	OO
moment	OO
of	OO
their	OO
conception	.O
so	OU
even	OO
though	OO
this	OO
arm	OO
has	OO
a	OO
really	OO
nice	OO
throw	OO
—	OO
it	OO
even	OO
hit	OO
the	OO
tripod	OO
at	OO
the	OO
end—	OO
it's	OO
not	OO
meant	OO
for	OO
cooking	OO
you	OO
breakfast	OO
per	OO
se	.O
it's	OU
not	OO
really	OO
suited	OO
for	OO
scrambled	OO
eggs	.O
so	OU
this	OO
was	OO
when	OO
i	OU
was	OO
hit	OO
by	OO
a	OO
new	OO
vision	OO
of	OO
future	OO
robotics:	OO
the	OO
transformers	.O
they	OU
drive	,O
they	OO
run	,O
they	OO
fly	,O
all	OO
depending	OO
on	OO
the	OO
ever	OO
changing	,O
new	OO
environment	OO
and	OO
task	OO
at	OO
hand	.O
to	OU
make	OO
this	OO
a	OO
reality	,O
you	OO
really	OO
have	OO
to	OO
rethink	OO
how	OO
robots	OO
are	OO
designed	.O
so	,U
imagine	OO
a	OO
robotic	OO
module	OO
in	OO
a	OO
polygon	OO
shape	OO
and	OO
using	OO
that	OO
simple	OO
polygon	OO
shape	OO
to	OO
reconstruct	OO
multiple	OO
different	OO
forms	OO
to	OO
create	OO
a	OO
new	OO
form	OO
of	OO
robot	OO
for	OO
different	OO
tasks	.O
in	OU
cg	,U
computer	OO
graphics	,O
it's	OO
not	OO
any	OO
news	OO
—	OO
it's	OO
been	OO
done	OO
for	OO
a	OO
while	,O
and	OO
that's	OO
how	OO
most	OO
of	OO
the	OO
movies	OO
are	OO
made	.O
but	OU
if	OO
you're	OO
trying	OO
to	OO
make	OO
a	OO
robot	OO
that's	OO
physically	OO
moving	,O
it's	OO
a	OO
completely	OO
new	OO
story	.O
it's	OU
a	OO
completely	OO
new	OO
paradigm	.O
but	OU
you've	OO
all	OO
done	OO
this	.O
who	OU
hasn't	OO
made	OO
a	OO
paper	OO
airplane	,O
paper	OO
boat	,O
paper	OO
crane	?O
origami	OU
is	OO
a	OO
versatile	OO
platform	OO
for	OO
designers	.O
from	OU
a	OO
single	OO
sheet	OO
of	OO
paper	,O
you	OO
can	OO
make	OO
multiple	OO
shapes	,O
and	OO
if	OO
you	OO
don't	OO
like	OO
it	,O
you	OO
unfold	OO
and	OO
fold	OO
back	OO
again	.O
any	OU
3d	OO
form	OO
can	OO
be	OO
made	OO
from	OO
2d	OO
surfaces	OO
by	OO
folding	,O
and	OO
this	OO
is	OO
proven	OO
mathematically	.O
and	OU
imagine	OO
if	OO
you	OO
were	OO
to	OO
have	OO
an	OO
intelligent	OO
sheet	OO
that	OO
can	OO
self	OO
fold	OO
into	OO
any	OO
form	OO
it	OO
wants	,O
anytime	.O
and	OU
that's	OO
what	OO
i've	OU
been	OO
working	OO
on	.O
i	OU
call	OO
this	OO
robotic	OO
origami	,O
robogami	.O
this	OU
is	OO
our	OO
first	OO
robogami	OO
transformation	OO
that	OO
was	OO
made	OO
by	OO
me	OO
about	OO
10	OO
years	OO
ago	.O
from	OU
a	OO
flat	OO
sheeted	OO
robot	,O
it	OO
turns	OO
into	OO
a	OO
pyramid	OO
and	OO
back	OO
into	OO
a	OO
flat	OO
sheet	OO
and	OO
into	OO
a	OO
space	OO
shuttle	.O
quite	OU
cute	.O
ten	OU
years	OO
later	,O
with	OO
my	OO
group	OO
of	OO
ninja	OO
origami	OO
robotic	OO
researchers	OO
—	OO
about	OO
22	OO
of	OO
them	OO
right	OO
now	OO
—	OO
we	OO
have	OO
a	OO
new	OO
generation	OO
of	OO
robogamis	,O
and	OO
they're	OO
a	OO
little	OO
more	OO
effective	OO
and	OO
they	OO
do	OO
more	OO
than	OO
that	.O
so	OU
the	OO
new	OO
generation	OO
of	OO
robogamis	OO
actually	OO
serve	OO
a	OO
purpose	.O
for	OU
example	,O
this	OO
one	OO
actually	OO
navigates	OO
through	OO
different	OO
terrains	OO
autonomously	.O
so	OU
when	OO
it's	OO
a	OO
dry	OO
and	OO
flat	OO
land	,O
it	OO
crawls	.O
and	OU
if	OO
it	OO
meets	OO
sudden	OO
rough	OO
terrain	,O
it	OO
starts	OO
rolling	.O
it	OU
does	OO
this	OO
—	OO
it's	OO
the	OO
same	OO
robot	OO
—	OO
but	OO
depending	OO
on	OO
which	OO
terrain	OO
it	OO
meets	,O
it	OO
activates	OO
a	OO
different	OO
sequence	OO
of	OO
actuators	OO
that's	OO
on	OO
board	.O
and	OU
once	OO
it	OO
meets	OO
an	OO
obstacle	,O
it	OO
jumps	OO
over	OO
it	.O
it	OU
does	OO
this	OO
by	OO
storing	OO
energy	OO
in	OO
each	OO
of	OO
its	OO
legs	OO
and	OO
releasing	OO
it	OO
and	OO
catapulting	OO
like	OO
a	OO
slingshot	.O
and	OU
it	OO
even	OO
does	OO
gymnastics	.O
yay	.U
so	OU
i	OU
just	OO
showed	OO
you	OO
what	OO
a	OO
single	OO
robogami	OO
can	OO
do	.O
imagine	OU
what	OO
they	OO
can	OO
do	OO
as	OO
a	OO
group	.O
they	OU
can	OO
join	OO
forces	OO
to	OO
tackle	OO
more	OO
complex	OO
tasks	.O
each	OU
module	,O
either	OO
active	OO
or	OO
passive	,O
we	OO
can	OO
assemble	OO
them	OO
to	OO
create	OO
different	OO
shapes	.O
not	OU
only	OO
that	,O
by	OO
controlling	OO
the	OO
folding	OO
joints	,O
we're	OO
able	OO
to	OO
create	OO
and	OO
attack	OO
different	OO
tasks	.O
the	OU
form	OO
is	OO
making	OO
new	OO
task	OO
space	.O
and	OU
this	OO
time	,O
what's	OO
most	OO
important	OO
is	OO
the	OO
assembly	.O
they	OU
need	OO
to	OO
autonomously	OO
find	OO
each	OO
other	OO
in	OO
a	OO
different	OO
space	,O
attach	OO
and	OO
detach	,O
depending	OO
on	OO
the	OO
environment	OO
and	OO
task	.O
and	OU
we	OO
can	OO
do	OO
this	OO
now	.O
so	OU
what's	OO
next	?O
our	OU
imagination	.O
this	OU
is	OO
a	OO
simulation	OO
of	OO
what	OO
you	OO
can	OO
achieve	OO
with	OO
this	OO
type	OO
of	OO
module	.O
we	OU
decided	OO
that	OO
we	OO
were	OO
going	OO
to	OO
have	OO
a	OO
four	OO
legged	OO
crawler	OO
turn	OO
into	OO
a	OO
little	OO
dog	OO
and	OO
make	OO
small	OO
gaits	.O
with	OU
the	OO
same	OO
module	,O
we	OO
can	OO
actually	OO
make	OO
it	OO
do	OO
something	OO
else:	OO
a	OO
manipulator	,O
a	OO
typical	,O
classical	OO
robotic	OO
task	.O
so	OU
with	OO
a	OO
manipulator	,O
it	OO
can	OO
pick	OO
up	OO
an	OO
object	.O
of	OU
course	,O
you	OO
can	OO
add	OO
more	OO
modules	OO
to	OO
make	OO
the	OO
manipulator	OO
legs	OO
longer	OO
to	OO
attack	OO
or	OO
pick	OO
up	OO
objects	OO
that	OO
are	OO
bigger	OO
or	OO
smaller	,O
or	OO
even	OO
have	OO
a	OO
third	OO
arm	.O
for	OU
robogamis	,O
there's	OO
no	OO
one	OO
fixed	OO
shape	OO
nor	OO
task	.O
they	OU
can	OO
transform	OO
into	OO
anything	,O
anywhere	,O
anytime	.O
so	OU
how	OO
do	OO
you	OO
make	OO
them	?O
the	OU
biggest	OO
technical	OO
challenge	OO
of	OO
robogami	OO
is	OO
keeping	OO
them	OO
super	OO
thin	,O
flexible	,O
but	OO
still	OO
remaining	OO
functional	.O
they're	OU
composed	OO
of	OO
multiple	OO
layers	OO
of	OO
circuits	,O
motors	,O
microcontrollers	OO
and	OO
sensors	,O
all	OO
in	OO
the	OO
single	OO
body	,O
and	OO
when	OO
you	OO
control	OO
individual	OO
folding	OO
joints	,O
you'll	OO
be	OO
able	OO
to	OO
achieve	OO
soft	OO
motions	OO
like	OO
that	OO
upon	OO
your	OO
command	.O
instead	OU
of	OO
being	OO
a	OO
single	OO
robot	OO
that	OO
is	OO
specifically	OO
made	OO
for	OO
a	OO
single	OO
task	,O
robogamis	OO
are	OO
optimized	OO
to	OO
do	OO
multi	OO
tasks	.O
and	OU
this	OO
is	OO
quite	OO
important	OO
for	OO
the	OO
difficult	OO
and	OO
unique	OO
environments	OO
on	OO
the	OO
earth	OU
as	OO
well	OO
as	OO
in	OO
space	.O
space	OU
is	OO
a	OO
perfect	OO
environment	OO
for	OO
robogamis	.O
you	OU
cannot	OO
afford	OO
to	OO
have	OO
one	OO
robot	OO
for	OO
one	OO
task	.O
who	OU
knows	OO
how	OO
many	OO
tasks	OO
you	OO
will	OO
encounter	OO
in	OO
space	?O
what	OU
you	OO
want	OO
is	OO
a	OO
single	OO
robotic	OO
platform	OO
that	OO
can	OO
transform	OO
to	OO
do	OO
multi	OO
tasks	.O
what	OU
we	OO
want	OO
is	OO
a	OO
deck	OO
of	OO
thin	OO
robogami	OO
modules	OO
that	OO
can	OO
transform	OO
to	OO
do	OO
multiples	OO
of	OO
performing	OO
tasks	.O
and	OU
don't	OO
take	OO
my	OO
word	OO
for	OO
it	,O
because	OO
the	OO
european	OU
space	OU
agency	OU
and	OO
swiss	OU
space	OU
center	OU
are	OO
sponsoring	OO
this	OO
exact	OO
concept	.O
so	OU
here	OO
you	OO
see	OO
a	OO

of	OO
images	OO
of	OO

of	OO

exploring	OO

foreign	OO
land	OO
aboveground	,O
on	OO
the	OO
surface	,O
as	OO
well	OO
as	OO
digging	OO
into	OO
the	OO
surface	.O
it's	OU
not	OO
just	OO
exploration	.O
for	OU
astronauts	,O
they	OO
need	OO
additional	OO
help	,O
because	OO
you	OO
cannot	OO
afford	OO
to	OO
bring	OO
interns	OO
up	OO
there	,O
either	.O
they	OU
have	OO
to	OO
do	OO
every	OO
tedious	OO
task	.O
they	OU
may	OO
be	OO
simple	,O
but	OO
super	OO
interactive	.O
so	OU
you	OO
need	OO
robots	OO
to	OO
facilitate	OO
their	OO
experiments	,O
assisting	OO
them	OO
with	OO
the	OO
communications	OO
and	OO
just	OO
docking	OO
onto	OO
surfaces	OO
to	OO
be	OO
their	OO
third	OO
arm	OO
holding	OO
different	OO
tools	.O
but	OU
how	OO
will	OO
they	OO
be	OO
able	OO
to	OO
control	OO
robogamis	,O
for	OO
example	,O
outside	OO
the	OO
space	OO
station	?O
in	OU
this	OO
case	,O
i	OU
show	OO
a	OO
robogami	OO
that	OO
is	OO
holding	OO
space	OO
debris	.O
you	OU
can	OO
work	OO
with	OO
your	OO
vision	OO
so	OO
that	OO
you	OO
can	OO
control	OO
them	,O
but	OO
what	OO
would	OO
be	OO
better	OO
is	OO
having	OO
the	OO
sensation	OO
of	OO
touch	OO
directly	OO
transported	OO
onto	OO
the	OO
hands	OO
of	OO
the	OO
astronauts	.O
and	OU
what	OO
you	OO
need	OO
is	OO
a	OO
haptic	OO
device	,O
a	OO
haptic	OO
interface	OO
that	OO
recreates	OO
the	OO
sensation	OO
of	OO
touch	.O
and	OU
using	OO
robogamis	,O
we	OO
can	OO
do	OO
this	.O
this	OU
is	OO
the	OO
world's	OO
smallest	OO
haptic	OO
interface	OO
that	OO
can	OO
recreate	OO
a	OO
sensation	OO
of	OO
touch	OO
just	OO
underneath	OO
your	OO
fingertip	.O
we	OU
do	OO
this	OO
by	OO
moving	OO
the	OO
robogami	OO
by	OO
microscopic	OO
and	OO
macroscopic	OO
movements	OO
at	OO
the	OO
stage	.O
and	OU
by	OO
having	OO
this	,O
not	OO
only	OO
will	OO
you	OO
be	OO
able	OO
to	OO
feel	OO
how	OO
big	OO
the	OO
object	OO
is	,O
the	OO
roundness	OO
and	OO
the	OO
lines	,O
but	OO
also	OO
the	OO
stiffness	OO
and	OO
the	OO
texture	.O
alex	OU
has	OO
this	OO
interface	OO
just	OO
underneath	OO
his	OO
thumb	,O
and	OO
if	OO
he	OO
were	OO
to	OO
use	OO
this	OO
with	OO
vr	OU
goggles	OO
and	OO
hand	OO
controllers	,O
now	OO
the	OO
virtual	OO
reality	OO
is	OO
no	OO
longer	OO
virtual	.O
it	OU
becomes	OO
a	OO
tangible	OO
reality	.O
the	OU
blue	OO
ball	,O
red	OO
ball	OO
and	OO
black	OO
ball	OO
that	OO
he's	OO
looking	OO
at	OO
is	OO
no	OO
longer	OO
differentiated	OO
by	OO
colors	.O
now	OU
it	OO
is	OO
a	OO
rubber	OO
blue	OO
ball	,O
sponge	OO
red	OO
ball	OO
and	OO
billiard	OO
black	OO
ball	.O
this	OU
is	OO
now	OO
possible	.O
let	OU
me	OO
show	OO
you	.O
this	OU
is	OO
really	OO
the	OO
first	OO
time	OO
this	OO
is	OO
shown	OO
live	OO
in	OO
front	OO
of	OO
a	OO
public	OO
grand	OO
audience	,O
so	OO
hopefully	OO
this	OO
works	.O
so	OU
what	OO
you	OO
see	OO
here	OO
is	OO
an	OO
atlas	OO
of	OO
anatomy	OO
and	OO
the	OO
robogami	OO
haptic	OO
interface	.O
so	,U
like	OO
all	OO
the	OO
other	OO
reconfigurable	OO
robots	,O
it	OO
multitasks	.O
not	OU
only	OO
is	OO
it	OO
going	OO
to	OO
serve	OO
as	OO
a	OO
mouse	,O
but	OO
also	OO
a	OO
haptic	OO
interface	.O
so	OU
for	OO
example	,O
we	OO
have	OO
a	OO
white	OO
background	OO
where	OO
there	OO
is	OO
no	OO
object	.O
that	OU
means	OO
there	OO
is	OO
nothing	OO
to	OO
feel	,O
so	OO
we	OO
can	OO
have	OO
a	OO
very	,O
very	OO
flexible	OO
interface	.O
now	,U
i	OU
use	OO
this	OO
as	OO
a	OO
mouse	OO
to	OO
approach	OO
skin	,O
a	OO
muscular	OO
arm	,O
so	OO
now	OO
let's	OO
feel	OO
his	OO
biceps	,O
or	OO
shoulders	.O
so	OU
now	OO
you	OO
see	OO
how	OO
much	OO
stiffer	OO
it	OO
becomes	.O
let's	OU
explore	OO
even	OO
more	.O
let's	OU
approach	OO
the	OO
ribcage	.O
and	OU
as	OO
soon	OO
as	OO
i	OU
move	OO
on	OO
top	OO
of	OO
the	OO
ribcage	OO
and	OO
between	OO
the	OO
intercostal	OO
muscles	,O
which	OO
is	OO
softer	OO
and	OO
harder	,O
i	OU
can	OO
feel	OO
the	OO
difference	OO
of	OO
the	OO
stiffness	.O
take	OU
my	OO
word	OO
for	OO
it	.O
so	OU
now	OO
you	OO
see	,O
it's	OO
much	OO
stiffer	OO
in	OO
terms	OO
of	OO
the	OO
force	OO
it's	OO
giving	OO
back	OO
to	OO
my	OO
fingertip	.O
so	OU
i	OU
showed	OO
you	OO
the	OO
surfaces	OO
that	OO
aren't	OO
moving	.O
how	OU
about	OO
if	OO
i	OU
were	OO
to	OO
approach	OO
something	OO
that	OO
moves	,O
for	OO
example	,O
like	OO
a	OO
beating	OO
heart	?O
what	OU
would	OO
i	OU
feel	?O
this	OU
can	OO
be	OO
your	OO
beating	OO
heart	.O
this	OU
can	OO
actually	OO
be	OO
inside	OO
your	OO
pocket	OO
while	OO
you're	OO
shopping	OO
online	.O
now	OU
you'll	OO
be	OO
able	OO
to	OO

the	OO
difference	OO
of	OO
the	OO
sweater	OO
that	OO
you're	OO
buying	,O
how	OO

it	OO
is	,O
if	OO
it's	OO

the	OO

that	OO
you're	OO
trying	OO

how	OO

it	OO

the	OO

the	OO

of	OO

it's	OU
a	OO

and	OO
to	OO
refocus	OO
society's	OO

on	OO
who	OO
is	OO
considered	OO
important	.O
i	OU
came	OO
up	OO
with	OO
the	OO
idea	OO
when	OO
i	OU
first	OO
joined	OO
obituaries	OU
in	OO
2017	.O
the	OU
black	OU
lives	OU
matter	OU
movement	OO
was	OO
at	OO
a	OO
rolling	OO
boil	,O
and	OO
the	OO
conversation	OO
on	OO
gender	OO
inequality	OO
had	OO
just	OO
started	OO
bubbling	OO
up	OO
again	.O
and	OU
at	OO
the	OO
same	OO
time	,O
i	OU
wondered	,O
as	OO
a	OO
journalist	OO
and	OO
as	OO
a	OO
woman	OO
of	OO
color	,O
what	OO
could	OO
i	OU
do	OO
to	OO
help	OO
advance	OO
this	OO
conversation	.O
people	OU
were	OO
coming	OO
out	OO
of	OO
the	OO
shadows	OO
to	OO
tell	OO
stories	OO
of	OO
injustices	OO
that	OO
they	OO
had	OO
faced	,O
and	OO
i	OU
could	OO
feel	OO
their	OO
pain	.O
so	OU
i	OU
noticed	OO
we	OO
would	OO
get	OO
these	OO
emails	,O
sometimes	,O
from	OO
readers	,O
saying	,O
hey	,U
why	OO
don't	OO
you	OO
have	OO
more	OO
women	OO
and	OO
people	OO
of	OO
color	OO
in	OO
your	OO
obituaries	?O
and	OU
i	OU
thought	,O
yeah	,U
why	OO
don't	OO
we	?O
since	OU
i	OU
was	OO
new	OO
to	OO
the	OO
team	,O
i	OU
asked	OO
my	OO
colleagues	,O
and	OO
they	OO
said	,O
well	,U
the	OO
people	OO
who	OO
are	OO
dying	OO
today	OO
are	OO
from	OO
a	OO
generation	OO
when	OO
women	OO
and	OO
people	OO
of	OO
color	OO
weren't	OO
invited	OO
to	OO
the	OO
table	OO
to	OO
make	OO
a	OO
difference	.O
perhaps	OU
in	OO
a	OO
generation	OO
or	OO
two	,O
we'll	OO
start	OO
to	OO
see	OO
more	OO
women	OO
and	OO
people	OO
of	OO
color	OO
in	OO
our	OO
obituaries	.O
that	OU
answer	OO
just	OO
wasn't	OO
satisfying	OO
at	OO
all	.O
i	OU
wanted	OO
to	OO
know:	OO
where	OU
are	OO
all	OO
the	OO
dead	OO
women	?O
so	OU
i	OU
started	OO
thinking	OO
about	OO
how	OO
we	OO
hear	OO
about	OO
people	OO
who	OO
have	OO
died	,O
right	?O
number	OU
one	OO
way	OO
is	OO
through	OO
reader	OO
submissions	.O
and	OU
so	OO
i	OU
thought	,O
well	,U
what	OO
if	OO
we	OO
were	OO
to	OO
look	OO
at	OO
international	OO
newspapers	OO
or	OO
scour	OO
social	OO
media	?O
it	OU
was	OO
around	OO
this	OO
time	OO
when	.O
everything	OU
was	OO
swirling	OO
in	OO
my	OO
mind	,O
and	OO
i	OU
came	OO
across	OO
a	OO
website	OO
about	OO
mary	OU
outerbridge	.U
she	OU
was	OO
credited	OO
with	OO
introducing	OO
tennis	OO
to	OO
america	OU
in	OO
1874	.O
and	OU
i	OU
thought	,O
wow	,O
one	OO
of	OO
the	OO
biggest	OO
sports	OO
in	OO
america	OU
was	OO
introduced	OO
by	OO
a	OO
woman	?O
does	OU
anyone	OO
even	OO
know	OO
that	?O
and	OU
did	OO
she	OO
get	OO
a	OO
new	OU
york	OU
times	OU
obituary	?O
spoiler	OU
alert	OO
—	OO
she	OO
did	OO
not	.O
so	OU
then	OO
i	OU
wondered	OO
who	OO
else	OO
we	OO
missed	.O
and	OU
it	OO
sent	OO
me	OO
on	OO
this	OO
deep	OO
dive	OO
through	OO
the	OO
archives	.O
there	OU
were	OO
some	OO
surprises	.O
the	OU
pioneering	OO
journalist	OO
ida	OU
b	.U
wells	,U
who	OO
started	OO
the	OO
campaign	OO
against	OO
lynching	.O
the	OU
brilliant	OO
poet	OO
sylvia	OU
plath	.U
ada	OU
lovelace	,U
a	OO
mathematician	OO
now	OO
recognized	OO
as	OO
the	OO
first	OO
computer	OO
programmer	.O
so	OU
i	OU
went	OO
back	OO
to	OO
my	OO
team	OO
and	OO
i	OU
said	,O
what	OU
if	OO
we	OO
were	OO
to	OO
tell	OO
their	OO
stories	OO
now	?O
it	OU
took	OO
a	OO
while	OO
to	OO
get	OO
buy	OO
in	.O
there	OU
was	OO
this	OO
concern	OO
that	,O
you	OO
know	,O
the	OO
newspaper	OO
might	OO
look	OO
bad	OO
because	OO
it	OO
didn't	OO
get	OO
it	OO
right	OO
the	OO
first	OO
time	.O
it	OU
was	OO
also	OO
a	OO
little	OO
weird	OO
to	OO
sort	OO
of	OO
look	OO
back	OO
at	OO
the	OO
past	,O
rather	OO
than	OO
cover	OO
news	OO
stories	OO
of	OO
our	OO
day	.O
but	OU
i	OU
said	,O
guys	,U
i	OU
really	OO
think	OO
this	OO
is	OO
worthwhile	.O
and	OU
once	OO
my	OO
team	OO
saw	OO
the	OO
value	OO
in	OO
it	,O
they	OO
were	OO
all	OO
in	.O
and	OU
so	,O
with	OO
the	OO
help	OO
of	OO
a	OO
dozen	OO
writers	OO
and	OO
editors	,O
we	OO
launched	OO
on	OO
march	OU
8	,O
2018	,O
with	OO
the	OO
stories	OO
of	OO
15	OO
remarkable	OO
women	.O
and	OU
while	OO
i	OU
knew	OO
that	OO
the	OO
work	OO
my	OO
team	OO
was	OO
doing	OO
was	OO
powerful	,O
i	OU
didn't	OO
expect	OO
the	OO
response	OO
to	OO
be	OO
equally	OO
powerful	.O
i	OU
had	OO
hundreds	OO
of	OO
emails	.O
they	OU
were	OO
from	OO
people	OO
who	OO
said	,O
thank	OU
you	OO
for	OO
finally	OO
giving	OO
these	OO
women	OO
a	OO
voice	.O
they	OU
were	OO
from	OO

who	OO
said	,O
i	OU
cried	OO
on	OO
my	OO
way	OO
to	OO
work	,O
reading	OO
these	OO
stories	,O
because	OO
i	OU
felt	OO
seen	OO
for	OO
the	OO

and	OU
they	OO
were	OO
from	OO
colleagues	OO

i	OU
never	OO

a	OO

to	OO
achieve	OO
something	OO

this	OO
at	OO
the	OO

i	OU
also	OO

about	OO

all	OU

how	OO

this	OO

it's	OU
also	OO
a	OO

of	OO
how	OO

what's	OO
happening	OO
in	OO
our	OO

every	OO

we	OO

to	OO

sure	OO
not	OO
to	OO

out	OO

that's	OU
why	,O
even	OO
though	OO
it's	OO

so	OO
meaningful	OO
to	OO
look	OO
back	OO
in	OO
the	OO

i'm	OU
plagued	OO
with	OO
the	OO
lingering	OO
question:	OO
what	OU
about	OO
the	OO
future	OO
of	OO
obituaries	OO
—	OO
how	OO
do	OO
i	OU
diversify	OO
those	?O
that	OU
was	OO
my	OO
original	OO
problem	,O
right	?O
so	OU
to	OO
start	OO
answering	OO
this	OO
question	,O
i	OU
wanted	OO
to	OO
gather	OO
some	OO
information	.O
i	OU
went	OO
down	OO
to	OO
the	OO
sub	OO
sub	OO
basement	OO
level	OO
of	OO
the	OO
new	OU
york	OU
times	OU
building	,U
to	OO
the	OO
archives	.O
we	OU
call	OO
it	OO
the	OO
morgue	.O
and	OU
i	OU
asked	OO
for	OO
some	OO
guidance	OO
from	OO
our	OO
archivist	OO
there	.O
he	OU
pointed	OO
me	OO
to	OO
a	OO
book	OO
called	OO
new	OU
york	OU
times	OU
obituaries	OU
index	.U
so	OU
we	OO
handed	OO
it	OO
to	OO
the	OO
new	OU
york	OU
genealogical	OU
society	,U
and	OO
they	OO
digitized	OO
it	OO
for	OO
us	.O
and	OU
then	OO
a	OO
programmer	OO
wrote	OO
up	OO
a	OO
program	OO
that	OO
scanned	OO
all	OO
those	OO
headlines	OO
for	OO
mr.	,U
mrs.	,U
lady	,U
sir	,U
all	OO
the	OO
sort	OO
of	OO
gender	OO
defining	OO
terms	.O
and	OU
what	OO
we	OO
found	OO
was	OO
that	OO
from	OO
1851	OO
to	OO
2017	,O
only	OO
about	OO
15	OO
to	OO
20	OO
percent	OO
of	OO
our	OO
obits	OO
were	OO
on	OO
women	.O
so	OU
next	,O
i	OU
worked	OO
with	OO
a	OO
programmer	OO
to	OO
build	OO
this	OO
tool	,O
called	OO
the	OO
diversity	OO
analysis	OO
tool	.O
it's	OU
a	OO
very	OO
dry	OO
name	,O
but	OO
bear	OO
with	OO
me	,O
it's	OO
super	OO
helpful	.O
it	OU
breaks	OO
down	OO
the	OO
percentage	OO
of	OO
our	OO
obits	OO
month	OO
to	OO
month	,O
women	OO
to	OO
men	.O
ok	,U
if	OO
that	OO
doesn't	OO
sound	OO
like	OO
much	OO
to	OO
you	,O
this	OO
is	OO
how	OO
i	OU
used	OO
to	OO
calculate	OO
it	OO
before	.O
so	OU
i	OU
asked	OO
this	OO
programmer	OO
to	OO
program	OO
in	OO
a	OO
goal	,O
and	OO
that	OO
goal	OO
was	OO
30	OO
percent	.O
from	OU
the	OO
year	OO
of	OO
overlooked's	OU
launch	,O
march	OU
of	OO
2018	,O
to	OO
march	OU
of	OO
2019	,O
i	OU
was	OO
hoping	OO
we	OO
could	OO
get	OO
to	OO
30	OO
percent	OO
of	OO
our	OO
obits	OO
on	OO
women	.O
it	OU
was	OO
a	OO
number	OO
we	OO
hadn't	OO
achieved	OO
in	OO
a	OO
168	OO
years	,O
and	OO
i'm	OU
happy	OO
to	OO
say	OO
we	OO
did	OO
it	OO
—	OO
we	OO
got	OO
to	OO
31	OO
percent	.O
it's	OU
awesome	,O
but	OO
it's	OO
not	OO
enough	.O
next	OU
we're	OO
hoping	OO
to	OO
get	OO
to	OO
35	OO
percent	,O
and	OO
then	OO
40	OO
percent	,O
until	OO
we	OO
achieve	OO
parity	.O
and	OU
then	OO
i'm	OU
hoping	OO
to	OO
partner	OO
with	OO
this	OO
programmer	OO
again	,O
to	OO
build	OO
a	OO
similar	OO
tool	OO
to	OO
measure	OO
people	OO
of	OO
color	OO
in	OO
our	OO
obits	.O
that	OU
was	OO
something	OO
i	OU
wanted	OO
to	OO
do	OO
with	OO
overlooked	OU
too	,O
to	OO
include	OO
men	OO
of	OO
color	,O
and	OO
i	OU
finally	OO
got	OO
to	OO
do	OO
it	OO
with	OO
a	OO
special	OO
section	OO
for	OO
black	OU
history	OU
month	,U
where	OO
we	OO
told	OO
the	OO

about	OO
a	OO
dozen	OO
black	OO
men	OO
and	OO
women	.O
again	,U
it	OO
was	OO
a	OO
really	OO
powerful	OO
experience	.O
many	OU
of	OO
these	OO

had	OO
been	OO

or	OO
were	OO
a	OO

a	OU

there	OO

there's	OU

yeah	,O
not	OO

when	OO
you	OO

you	OO

they're	OU
the	OO

a	OU

you	.O
i'm	OU
a	OO

i'm	OU
also	OO
a	OO

and	OU
i	OU
have	OO
a	OO
habit	OO

asking	OO

it	OU
started	OO
when	OO
i	OU
was	OO
10	OO
years	OO
old	,O
and	OO
my	OO
mother	,O
who	OO
was	OO
raising	OO
six	OO
children	,O

no	OO
time	OO
for	OO
them	.O
at	OU
14	,O
fed	OO
up	OO
with	OO
my	OO
increasingly	OO
annoying	OO
questions	,O
she	OO
recommended	OO
that	OO
i	OU
begin	OO
writing	OO
for	OO
the	OO
local	OO
english	OU
language	OO
newspaper	OO
in	OO
pakistan	,U
to	OO
put	OO
my	OO
questions	OO
out	OO
to	OO
the	OO
entire	OO
country	,O
she	OO
said	.O
at	OU
17	,O
i	OU
was	OO
an	OO
undercover	OO
investigative	OO
journalist	.O
i	OU
don't	OO
even	OO
think	OO
my	OO
editor	OO
knew	OO
just	OO
how	OO
young	OO
i	OU
was	OO
when	OO
i	OU
sent	OO
in	OO
a	OO
story	OO
that	OO
named	OO
and	OO
shamed	OO
some	OO
very	OO
powerful	OO
people	.O
the	OU
men	OO
i'd	OU
written	OO
about	OO
wanted	OO
to	OO
teach	OO
me	OO
a	OO
lesson	.O
they	OU
wanted	OO
to	OO
shame	OO
me	OO
and	OO
my	OO
family	.O
they	OU
spray	OO
painted	OO
my	OO

my	OO

name	OO
with	OO
unspeakable	OO
profanities	OO
across	OO
our	OO
front	OO
gate	OO
and	OO
around	OO
our	OO
neighborhood	.O
and	OU
they	OO
felt	OO
that	OO
my	OO
father	,O
who	OO
was	OO
a	OO
strict	OO
man	OO
of	OO
tradition	,O
would	OO
stop	OO
me	.O
instead	,U
my	OO
father	OO
stood	OO
in	OO

of	OO
me	OO
and	OO
said	,O
if	OU
you	OO
speak	OO
the	OO
truth	,O
i	OU
will	OO
stand	OO
with	OO
you	,O
and	OO
so	OO
will	OO
the	OO
world	.O
and	OU
then	OO
he	OO
got	OO
—	OO
and	OU
then	OO
he	OO
got	OO
a	OO
group	OO
of	OO
people	OO
together	OO
and	OO
they	OO
whitewashed	OO
the	OO

i've	OU
always	OO
wanted	OO
my	OO

to	OO
jolt	OO
people	,O
to	OO
shake	OO
them	OO
into	OO
having	OO
difficult	OO

i	OU
felt	OO
that	OO
i	OU
would	OO
be	OO
more	OO
effective	OO
if	OO
i	OU
did	OO
something	OO
visual	.O
and	OU
so	OO
at	OO

i	OU
became	OO
a	OO
documentary	OO

turning	OO
my	OO

onto	OO

on	OO
the	OO

in	OO

eventually	OO
returning	OO

where	OO

to	OO
document	OO

pakistan	OU

to	OO
200	OO

with	OO
its	OO

in	OO

her	OO

then	OO
our	OO

was	OO
nominated	OO
for	OO
an	OO
academy	OU
award	,U
and	OO
honor	OO
killings	OO
became	OO

and	OO
the	OO
prime	OO

while	OO
sending	OO
his	OO

the	OO
first	OO
screening	OO
of	OO
the	OO
film	OO
at	OO
his	OO
office	.O
of	OU
course	,O
we	OO
jumped	OO
at	OO
the	OO
chance	,O
because	OO
no	OO
prime	OO

in	OO
the	OO
history	OO
of	OO
the	OO

ever	OO
done	OO
so	.O
and	OU
at	OO
the	OO

which	OO
was	OO
carried	OO
live	OO
on	OO

he	OO
said	OO
something	OO
that	OO
reverberated	OO
throughout	OO
the	OO

there	OU
is	OO
no	OO
honor	OO
in	OO

he	OO

at	OU
the	OO

in	OO
la	,U
many	OO
of	OO
the	OO
pundits	OO
had	OO
written	OO
us	OO
off	,O
but	OO
we	OO
felt	OO
that	OO
in	OO
order	OO
for	OO
the	OO
legislative	OO
push	OO
to	OO
continue	,O
we	OO
needed	OO
that	OO
win	.O
and	OU
then	,O
my	OO
name	OO
was	OO
announced	,O
and	OO
i	OU
bounded	OO
up	OO
the	OO
steps	OO
in	OO
flip	OO
flops	,O
because	OO
i	OU
didn't	OO
expect	OO
to	OO
be	OO
onstage	.O
and	OU
i	OU
accepted	OO
the	OO
statue	,O
telling	OO
a	OO
billion	OO
people	OO
watching	OO
that	OO
the	OO
prime	OO
minister	OO
of	OO
pakistan	OU
had	OO
pledged	OO
to	OO
change	OO
the	OO
law	,O
because	,O
of	OO
course	,O
that's	OO
one	OO
way	OO
of	OO
holding	OO
the	OO
prime	OO
minister	OO
accountable	.O
and	OU
—	OO
back	OU
home	,O
the	OO
oscar	OU
win	OO
dominated	OO
headline	OO
news	,O
and	OO
more	OO
people	OO
joined	OO
the	OO
fray	,O
asking	OO
for	OO
the	OO
loophole	OO
in	OO
the	OO
law	OO
to	OO
be	OO
closed	.O
and	OU
then	OO
in	OO
october	OU
2016	,O
after	OO
months	OO
of	OO
campaigning	,O
the	OO
loophole	OO
was	OO
indeed	OO
closed	.O
and	OU
now	OO
men	OO
who	OO
kill	OO
women	OO
in	OO
the	OO
name	OO
of	OO
honor	OO
receive	OO
life	OO
imprisonment	.O
yet	,U
the	OO
very	OO
next	OO
day	,O
a	OO
woman	OO
was	OO
killed	OO
in	OO
the	OO
name	OO
of	OO
honor	,O
and	OO
then	OO
another	OO
and	OO
another	.O
we	OU
had	OO
impacted	OO
legislation	,O
but	OO
that	OO
wasn't	OO
enough	.O
we	OU
needed	OO
to	OO
take	OO
the	OO
film	OO
and	OO
its	OO
message	OO
to	OO
the	OO
heartland	,O
to	OO
small	OO
towns	OO

villages	OO
across	OO
the	OO

you	OU

for	OO
me	,O

a	OO
very	OO
positive	OO
role	OO
in	OO
changing	OO
and	OO
molding	OO

in	OO
a	OO
positive	OO

but	OU
how	OO
would	OO
we	OO
get	OO
to	OO
these	OO
places	?O
how	OU
would	OO
we	OO
get	OO
to	OO
these	OO
small	OO
towns	OO
and	OO
villages	?O
we	OU
built	OO
a	OO
mobile	OO

a	OO

that	OO
would	OO
roll	OO
through	OO
the	OO
length	OO

of	OO
the	OO
country	,O
that	OO
would	OO
stop	OO
in	OO
small	OO

we	OU
outfitted	OO
it	OO
with	OO
a	OO
large	OO
screen	OO
that	OO
would	OO
light	OO
up	OO
the	OO
night	OO
sky	,O
and	OO
we	OO
called	OO
it	OO
look	OU
but	OU
with	OU
love	.U
it	OU
would	OO
give	OO
the	OO
community	OO
an	OO
opportunity	OO
to	OO
come	OO
together	OO
and	OO
watch	OO
films	OO
in	OO
the	OO
evening	.O
we	OU
knew	OO
we	OO
could	OO
attract	OO
men	OO
and	OO
children	OO
in	OO
the	OO
mobile	OO
cinema	.O
they	OU
would	OO
come	OO
out	OO
and	OO
watch	.O
but	OU
what	OO
about	OO
women	?O
in	OU
these	OO
small	,O
rural	OO
communities	OO
that	OO
are	OO
segregated	,O
how	OO
would	OO
we	OO
get	OO

to	OO

out	?O
we	OU
had	OO
to	OO
work	OO
with	OO
prevailing	OO
cultural	OO
norms	OO
in	OO

to	OO
do	OO
so	,O
and	OO
so	OO
we	OO
built	OO
a	OO
cinema	OO
inside	OO
the	OO
cinema	,O
outfitting	OO
it	OO
with	OO
seats	OO
and	OO
a	OO
screen	OO
where	OO
women	OO
could	OO
go	OO
inside	OO
and	OO
watch	OO
without	OO
fearing	OO
or	OO
being	OO
embarrassed	OO
or	OO
harassment	.O
we	OU
began	OO
to	OO
introduce	OO
everyone	OO
to	OO
films	OO
that	OO
opened	OO
up	OO
their	OO
minds	OO
to	OO
competing	OO

encouraging	OO

to	OO
build	OO
critical	OO
thinking	OO
so	OO
that	OO
they	OO
could	OO
ask	OO

and	OU
we	OO
expanded	OO
our	OO
scope	OO
beyond	OO
honor	OO

talking	OO
about	OO

the	OO

about	OO

tolerance	OO

and	OU
inside	,O
for	OO

we	OO
showed	OO
them	OO
films	OO
in	OO
which	OO
they	OO
were	OO
heroes	,O
not	OO
victims	,O
and	OO
we	OO
told	OO
them	OO
how	OO
they	OO

navigate	OO
the	OO
court	OO
system	,O
the	OO
police	OO
system	,O
educating	OO
them	OO
about	OO

where	OO
they	OO

if	OO
they	OO
were	OO
victims	OO
of	OO
domestic	OO
violence	,O
where	OO
they	OO
could	OO
go	OO
and	OO
get	OO
help	.O
we	OU
were	OO
surprised	OO
that	OO
we	OO
were	OO
welcomed	OO
in	OO
so	OO
many	OO
of	OO
the	OO
places	OO
that	OO
we	OO
went	OO
to	.O
many	OU
of	OO
the	OO

they	OO
were	OO
eager	OO
for	OO
their	OO

to	OO
learn	.O
but	OU
there	OO
was	OO
also	OO
pushback	OO
and	OO
blowback	OO
with	OO
the	OO
ideas	OO
that	OO
we	OO
were	OO
bringing	OO
with	OO
us	.O
two	OU
members	OO
of	OO
our	OO

resigned	OO
because	OO

from	OO
villages	.O
and	OU
in	OO
one	OO
of	OO
the	OO
villages	OO
that	OO
we	OO
were	OO
screening	OO
in	,O
they	OO
shut	OO
it	OO
down	OO
and	OO

they	OO
didn't	OO
want	OO
the	OO

to	OO
know	OO
about	OO
their	OO

but	OU
on	OO
the	OO

in	OO
another	OO

when	OO
a	OO

was	OO
shut	OO
down	,O
a	OO
plainclothes	OO

up	OO

it	OO
back	OO
on	,O

by	,O

our	OO

that	OO
it	OO

his	OO
duty	OO
to	OO

the	OO

to	OO
an	OO

to	OO
this	OO

he	OU

an	OO

but	OU
we've	OO
come	OO
across	OO
so	OO
many	OO
of	OO
these	OO
heroes	OO
on	OO
our	OO
journey	.O
in	OU
another	OO
town	,O
where	OO
the	OO
men	OO
said	OO
that	OO
only	OO
they	OO

watch	OO
and	OO
the	OO
women	OO
had	OO
to	OO

a	OO

up	,O

a	OO

of	OO

together	,O

a	OO
discussion	,O
and	OO
then	OO
both	OO
men	OO

sat	OO
down	OO
to	OO
watch	OO
together	.O
we	OU
are	OO
documenting	OO
what	OO
we	OO
are	OO
doing	.O
we	OU
talk	OO
to	OO
people	.O
we	OU
adapt	.O
we	OU
change	OO
the	OO
lineup	OO
of	OO
films	.O
when	OU
we	OO
show	OO
men	OO
films	OO
that	OO
show	OO
perpetrators	OO
of	OO
violence	OO
behind	OO

we	OO
want	OO
to	OO

home	OO
the	OO
fact	OO
that	OO
if	OO

are	OO
violent	,O
there	OO
will	OO

but	OU
we	OO
also	OO
show	OO
films	OO
where	OO
men	OO
are	OO
seen	OO
as	OO

because	OO
we	OO

them	OO
to	OO

on	OO
those	OO

for	OU

we're	OO

it's	OO

important	OO
to	OO

what	OO
we	OO

doing	OO
and	OO
spread	OO
it	OO
across	OO
the	OO

in	OU

the	OO

the	OO

at	OO
a	OO

thank	OU
you	.O
so	OU
i've	OU
got	OO
something	OO
that	OO
i'm	OU
slightly	OO
embarrassed	OO
to	OO
admit	OO
to	.O
at	OU
the	OO
age	OO
of	OO
17	,O
as	OO
a	OO
creationist	,O
i	OU
decided	OO
to	OO
go	OO
to	OO
university	OO
to	OO
study	OO
evolution	OO
so	OO
that	OO
i	OU
could	OO
destroy	OO
it	.O
i	OU
failed	.O
i	OU
failed	OO
so	OO
spectacularly	OO
that	OO
i'm	OU
now	OO
an	OO
evolutionary	OO
biologist	.O
so	OU
i'm	OU
a	OO
paleoanthropologist	,O
i'm	OU
a	OO
national	OU
geographic	OU
explorer	OU
specializing	OO
in	OO
fossil	OO
hunting	OO
in	OO
caves	OO
in	OO
unstable	,O
hostile	OO
and	OO
disputed	OO
territories	.O
and	OU
we	OO
all	OO
know	OO
that	OO
if	OO
i	OU
was	OO
a	OO
guy	OO
and	OO
not	OO
a	OO
girl	,O
that	OO
wouldn't	OO
be	OO
a	OO
job	OO
description	,O
that	OO
would	OO
be	OO
a	OO
pick	OO
up	OO
line	.O
now	,U
here's	OO
the	OO
thing	.O
i	OU
do	OO
not	OO
have	OO
a	OO
death	OO
wish	.O
i'm	OU
not	OO
an	OO
adrenaline	OO
junkie	.O
i	OU
just	OO
looked	OO
at	OO
a	OO
map	.O
see	,U
frontline	OO
exploratory	OO
science	OO
does	OO
not	OO
happen	OO
as	OO
much	OO
in	OO
politically	OO
unstable	OO
territories	.O
this	OU
is	OO
a	OO
map	OO
of	OO
all	OO
the	OO
places	OO
which	OO
the	OO
british	OU
foreign	OU
office	OU
have	OO
declared	OO
contain	OO
red	OO
zones	,O

zones	OO
or	OO
have	OO
raised	OO
some	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
a	OO
threat	OO
warning	OO
about	.O
now	OU
i'm	OU
going	OO
to	OO
go	OO
out	OO
on	OO
a	OO
limb	OO
here	OO
and	OO
say	OO
that	OO
it	OO
is	OO
a	OO
tragedy	OO
if	OO
we're	OO
not	OO
doing	OO
frontline	OO
exploratory	OO
science	OO
in	OO
a	OO
huge	OO
portion	OO
of	OO
the	OO
planet	.O
and	OU
so	OO
science	OO
has	OO
a	OO
geography	OO
problem	.O
also	,U
as	OO
a	OO
paleoanthropologist	,O
guys	,O
this	OO
is	OO
basically	OO
a	OO
map	OO
of	OO
some	OO
of	OO
the	OO
most	OO
important	OO
places	OO
in	OO
the	OO
human	OO
journey	.O
there	OU
are	OO
almost	OO
definitely	OO
fascinating	OO
fossils	OO
to	OO
be	OO
found	OO
here	.O
but	OU
are	OO
we	OO
looking	OO
for	OO
them	?O
and	OU
so	OO
as	OO
an	OO
undergraduate	,O
i	OU
was	OO
repeatedly	OO
told	OO
that	OO
humans	,O
be	OO
they	OO
ourselves	,O
homo	OO
sapiens	,O
or	OO
earlier	OO
species	,O
that	OO
we	OO
left	OO
africa	OU
via	OO
the	OO
sinai	OU
of	OO
egypt	.U
i'm	OU
english	,U
as	OO
you	OO
can	OO
probably	OO
tell	OO
from	OO
my	OO
accent	,O
but	OO
i	OU
am	OO
actually	OO
of	OO
arab	OU
heritage	,O
and	OO
i	OU
always	OO
say	OO
that	OO
i'm	OU
very	,O
very	OO
arab	OU
on	OO
the	OO
outside	.O
you	OU
know	,O
i	OU
can	OO
really	OO
be	OO
passionate	.O
like	,U
you're	OU
amazing	.O
i	OU
love	OO
you	.O
but	OU
on	OO
the	OO
inside	,O
i'm	OU
really	OO
english	,U
so	OO
everybody	OO
irritates	OO
me	.O
it's	OU
true	.O
and	OU
the	OO
thing	OO
is	,O
my	OO
family	OO
are	OO
arab	OU
from	OO
yemen	,U
and	OO
i	OU
knew	OO
that	OO
that	OO
channel	,O
bab	OU
el	OO
mandeb	,U
is	OO
not	OO
that	OO
much	OO
of	OO
a	OO
feat	OO
to	OO
cross	.O
and	OU
i	OU
kept	OO
asking	OO
myself	OO
this	OO
really	OO
simple	OO
question:	OO
if	OO
the	OO
ancestors	OO
to	OO
new	OU
world	OU
monkeys	OO
could	OO
somehow	OO
cross	OO
the	OO
atlantic	OU
ocean	,U
why	OO
couldn't	OO
humans	OO
cross	OO
that	OO
tiny	OO
stretch	OO
of	OO
water	?O
but	OU
the	OO
thing	OO
is	,O
yemen	,U
compared	OO
to	,O
let's	OO
say	,O
europe	,U
was	OO
so	OO
understudied	OO
that	OO
it	OO
was	OO
something	OO
akin	OO
to	OO
near	OO
virgin	OO
territory	.O
but	OU
that	,O
along	OO
with	OO
its	OO
location	,O
made	OO
the	OO
sheer	OO
potential	OO
for	OO
discovery	OO
so	OO
exciting	,O
and	OO
i	OU
had	OO
so	OO
many	OO
questions	.O
when	OU
did	OO
we	OO
first	OO
start	OO
using	OO
bab	OU
el	OO
mandeb	?U
but	OU
also	,O
which	OO
species	OO
of	OO
human	OO
besides	OO
ourselves	OO
made	OO
it	OO
to	OO
yemen	?U
might	OU
we	OO
find	OO
a	OO
species	OO
as	OO
yet	OO
unknown	OO
to	OO
science	?O
and	OU
it	OO
turned	OO
out	,O
i	OU
wasn't	OO
the	OO
only	OO
one	OO
who	OO
had	OO
noticed	OO
yemen's	OU
potential	.O
there	OU
was	OO
actually	OO
a	OO
few	OO
other	OO
academics	OO
out	OO
there	.O
but	OU
sadly	,O
due	OO
to	OO
political	OO
instability	,O
they	OO
moved	OO
out	,O
and	OO
so	OO
i	OU
moved	OO
in	.O
and	OU
i	OU
was	OO
looking	OO
for	OO
caves:	OO
caves	OO
because	OO
caves	OO
are	OO
the	OO
original	OO
prime	OO
real	OO
estate	.O
but	OU
also	OO
because	OO
if	OO
you're	OO
looking	OO
for	OO
fossils	OO
in	OO
that	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
heat	,O
your	OO
best	OO
bet	OO
for	OO
fossil	OO
preservation	OO
is	OO
always	OO
going	OO
to	OO
be	OO
caves	.O
but	OU
then	,O
yemen	OU
took	OO
a	OO
really	OO
sad	OO
turn	OO
for	OO
the	OO
worse	,O
and	OO
just	OO
a	OO
few	OO
days	OO
before	OO
i	OU
was	OO
due	OO
to	OO
fly	OO
out	OO
to	OO
yemen	,U
the	OO
civil	OO
war	OO
escalated	OO
into	OO
a	OO
regional	OO
conflict	,O
the	OO
capital's	OO
airport	OO
was	OO
bombed	OO
and	OO
yemen	OU
became	OO
a	OO
no	OO
fly	OO
zone	.O
now	,U
my	OO
parents	OO
made	OO
this	OO
decision	OO
before	OO
i	OU
was	OO
born:	OO
that	OO
i	OU
would	OO
be	OO
born	OO
british	.U
i	OU
had	OO
nothing	OO
to	OO
do	OO
with	OO
the	OO
best	OO
decision	OO
of	OO
my	OO
life	.O
and	OU
now	.O
now	OU
the	OO
lucky	OO

this	OU

it's	OU

it	OO

to	OO
a	OO

there	OU

a	OO

there	,O
a	OO
man	OO

that's	OU
a	OO
man	OO
made	OO

so	OO
not	OO
a	OO
natural	OO
famine	,O
an	OO
entirely	OO
man	OO
made	OO
famine	OO
that	OO
the	OO

the	OO

the	OO
world	OO

seen	OO
in	OO
a	OO
hundred	OO
years	.O
this	OU
war	OO
has	OO
made	OO
it	OO
clear	OO
to	OO
me	OO
more	OO
than	OO
ever	OO
that	OO
no	OO
place	,O
no	OO
people	OO
deserve	OO
to	OO
get	OO
left	OO
behind	.O
and	OU
so	OO
i	OU
was	OO
joining	OO
these	OO
other	OO
teams	,O
and	OO
i	OU
was	OO
forming	OO
new	OO
collaborations	OO
in	OO
other	OO
unstable	OO
places	.O
but	OU
i	OU
was	OO
desperate	OO
to	OO
get	OO
back	OO
into	OO
yemen	,U
because	OO
for	OO
me	,O
yemen's	OU
really	OO
personal	.O
and	OU
so	OO
i	OU
kept	OO
trying	OO
to	OO
think	OO
of	OO
a	OO
project	OO
i	OU
could	OO
do	OO
in	OO
yemen	OU
that	OO
would	OO
help	OO
highlight	OO
what	OO
was	OO
going	OO
on	OO
there	.O
and	OU
every	OO
idea	OO
i	OU
had	OO
just	OO
kept	OO
failing	,O
or	OO
it	OO
was	OO
just	OO
too	OO
high	OO
risk	,O
because	OO
let's	OO
be	OO
honest	,O
most	OO
of	OO
yemen	OU
is	OO
just	OO
too	OO
dangerous	OO
for	OO
a	OO
western	OU
team	.O
but	OU
then	OO
i	OU
was	OO
told	OO
that	OO
socotra	,U
a	OO
yemeni	OU
island	,O
was	OO
safe	OO
once	OO
you	OO
got	OO
there	.O
in	OU
fact	,O
it	OO
turned	OO
out	OO
there	OO
was	OO
a	OO
few	OO
local	OO
and	OO
international	OO
academics	OO
that	OO
were	OO
still	OO
working	OO
there	.O
and	OU
that	OO
got	OO
me	OO
really	OO
excited	,O
because	OO
look	OO
at	OO
socotra's	OU
proximity	OO
to	OO
africa	.U
and	OU
yet	OO
we	OO
have	OO
no	OO
idea	OO
when	OO
humans	OO
arrived	OO
on	OO
that	OO
island	.O
but	OU
socotra	,U
for	OO
those	OO
of	OO
you	OO
who	OO
know	OO
it	,O
well	,O
let's	OO
just	OO
say	OO
you	OO
probably	OO
know	OO
it	OO
for	OO
a	OO
completely	OO
different	OO
reason	.O
you	OU
probably	OO
know	OO
it	OO
as	OO
the	OO
galapagos	OU
of	OO
the	OO
indian	OU
ocean	,U
because	OO
it	OO
is	OO
one	OO
of	OO
the	OO
most	OO
biodiverse	OO
places	OO
on	OO
this	OO
earth	.O
but	OU
we	OO
were	OO
also	OO
getting	OO
information	OO
that	OO
this	OO
incredibly	OO
delicate	OO
environment	OO
and	OO
its	OO
people	OO
were	OO
under	OO
threat	OO
because	OO
they	OO
were	OO
at	OO
the	OO
frontline	OO
of	OO
both	OO
middle	OU
eastern	OU
politics	OO
and	OO
climate	OO
change	.O
and	OU
it	OO
slowly	OO
dawned	OO
on	OO
me	OO
that	OO
socotra	OU
was	OO
my	OO
yemen	OU
project	.O
and	OU
so	OO
i	OU
wanted	OO
to	OO
put	OO
together	OO
a	OO
huge	OO
multidisciplinary	OO
team	.O
we	OU
wanted	OO
to	OO
cross	OO
the	OO
archipelago	OO
on	OO
foot	,O
camel	OO
and	OO
dhow	OO
boat	OO
to	OO
conduct	OO
a	OO
health	OO
check	OO
of	OO
this	OO
place	.O
this	OU
has	OO
only	OO
been	OO
attempted	OO
once	OO
before	,O
and	OO
it	OO
was	OO
in	OO
1999	.O
but	OU
the	OO
thing	OO
is	,O
that	OO
is	OO
not	OO
an	OO
easy	OO
thing	OO
to	OO
pull	OO
off	.O
and	OU
so	OO
we	OO
desperately	OO
needed	OO
a	OO
recce	,O
and	OO
for	OO
those	OO
of	OO
you	OO
who	OO
aren't	OO
familiar	OO
with	OO
british	OU
english	,U
a	OO
recce	OO
is	OO
like	OO
a	OO
scouting	OO
expedition	.O
it's	OU
like	OO
a	OO
reconnaissance	.O
and	OU
i	OU
often	OO
say	OO
that	OO
a	OO
really	OO
big	OO
expedition	OO
without	OO
a	OO
recce	OO
is	OO
a	OO
bit	OO
like	OO
a	OO
first	OO
date	OO
without	OO
a	OO
facebook	OU
stalk	.O
like	,U
it's	OO
doable	,O
but	OO
is	OO
it	OO
wise	?O
there's	OU
a	OO
few	OO
too	OO
many	OO
knowing	OO
laughs	OO
in	OO
this	OO
room	.O
anyway	,U
so	OO
then	OO
our	OO
recce	OO
team	OO
thankfully	OO
were	OO
no	OO
strangers	OO
to	OO
unstable	OO
places	,O
which	,O
let's	OO
be	OO
honest	,O
is	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
important	OO
because	OO
we	OO
were	OO
trying	OO
to	OO
get	OO
to	OO
a	OO
place	OO
between	OO
yemen	OU
and	OO
somalia	,U
and	OU
after	OO
calling	OO
in	OO
what	OO
felt	OO
like	OO
a	OO
million	OO
favors	,O
including	OO
to	OO
the	OO
deputy	OO
governor	,O
we	OO
finally	OO
found	OO
ourselves	OO
on	OO
the	OO
move	,O
albeit	OO
on	OO
a	OO
wooden	OO
cement	OO
cargo	OO
ship	OO
sailing	OO
through	OO
pirate	OO
waters	OO
in	OO
the	OO
indian	OU
ocean	OU
with	OO
this	OO
as	OO
a	OO
toilet	.O
can	OU
you	OO
guys	OO
see	OO
this	?O
you	OU
know	OO
how	OO
everybody	OO
has	OO
their	OO
worst	OO
toilet	OO
story	?O
well	,U
i've	OU
never	OO
swam	OO
with	OO
dolphins	OO
before	.O
i	OU
just	OO
went	OO
straight	OO
to	OO
pooping	OO
on	OO
them	.O
and	OU
also	,O
i	OU
genuinely	OO
discovered	OO
that	OO
i	OU
am	OO
genuinely	OO
less	OO
stressed	OO
by	OO
pirate	OO
waters	OO
than	OO
i	OU
am	OO
with	OO
a	OO
cockroach	OO
infestation	OO
that	OO
was	OO
so	OO
intense	OO
that	OO
at	OO
one	OO
point	OO
i	OU
went	OO
belowdeck	,O
and	OO
the	OO
floor	OO
was	OO
black	OO
and	OO
it	OO
was	OO
moving	.O
yeah	,U
and	OO
at	OO
night	OO
there	OO
was	OO
three	OO
raised	OO
platforms	OO
to	OO
sleep	OO
on	,O
but	OO
there	OO
was	OO
only	OO
—	OO
let's	OO
say	OO
there	OO
was	OO
four	OO
team	OO
members	,O
and	OO
the	OO
thing	OO
is	,O
if	OO
you	OO
got	OO
a	OO
raised	OO
platform	OO
to	OO
sleep	OO
on	,O
you	OO
only	OO
had	OO
to	OO
contend	OO
with	OO
a	OO
few	OO
cockroaches	OO
during	OO
the	OO
night	,O
whereas	OO
if	OO
you	OO
got	OO
the	OO
floor	,O
good	OO
luck	OO
to	OO
you	.O
and	OU
so	OO
i	OU
was	OO
the	OO
only	OO
girl	OO
in	OO
the	OO
team	OO
and	OO
the	OO
whole	OO
ship	,O
so	OO
i	OU
got	OO
away	OO
without	OO
sleeping	OO
on	OO
the	OO
floor	.O
and	OU
then	,O
on	,O
like	,O
the	OO
fourth	OO
or	OO
fifth	OO
night	,O
martin	OU
edström	OU
looks	OO
at	OO
me	OO
and	OO
goes	,O
ella	,U
ella	OU
i	OU
really	OO
believe	OO
in	OO
equality	.O
so	OU
we	OO
were	OO
sailing	OO
on	OO
that	OO
cement	OO
cargo	OO
ship	OO
for	OO
three	OO
days	,O
and	OO
then	OO
we	OO
slowly	OO
started	OO
seeing	OO
land	.O
and	OU
after	OO
three	OO
years	OO
of	OO
failing	,O
i	OU
was	OO
finally	OO
seeing	OO
yemen	.U
and	OU
there	OO
is	OO
no	OO
feeling	OO
on	OO
earth	OO
like	OO
that	OO
start	OO
of	OO
an	OO
expedition	.O
it's	OU
this	OO
moment	OO
where	OO
you	OO
jump	OO
out	OO
of	OO
a	OO
jeep	OO
or	OO
you	OO
look	OO
up	OO
from	OO
a	OO
boat	OO
and	OO
you	OO
know	OO
that	OO
there's	OO
this	OO
possibility	,O
it's	OO
small	OO
but	OO
it's	OO
still	OO
there	,O
that	OO
you're	OO
about	OO
to	OO
find	OO
something	OO
that	OO
could	OO
add	OO
to	OO
or	OO
change	OO
our	OO
knowledge	OO
of	OO
who	OO
we	OO
are	OO
and	OO
where	OO
we	OO
come	OO
from	.O
there	OU
is	OO
no	OO
feeling	OO
like	OO
it	OO
on	OO
earth	,O
and	OO
it's	OO
a	OO
feeling	OO
that	OO
so	OO
many	OO
scientists	OO
have	OO
but	OO
rarely	OO
in	OO
politically	OO
unstable	OO
places	.O
because	OU
western	OU
scientists	OO
are	OO
discouraged	OO
or	OO
all	OO
out	OO
barred	OO
from	OO
working	OO
in	OO
unstable	OO
places	.O
but	OU
here's	OO
the	OO
thing:	OO
scientists	OO
specialize	OO
in	OO
the	OO
jungle	.O
scientists	OU
work	OO
in	OO
deep	OO
cave	OO
systems	.O
scientists	OU
attach	OO
themselves	OO
to	OO
rockets	OO
and	OO
blow	OO
themselves	OO
into	OO
outer	OO
space	.O
but	OU
apparently	,O
working	OO
in	OO
an	OO
unstable	OO
place	OO
is	OO
deemed	OO
too	OO
high	OO
risk	.O
it	OU
is	OO
completely	OO
arbitrary	.O
who	OU
here	OO
in	OO
this	OO
room	OO
wasn't	OO
brought	OO
up	OO
on	OO
adventure	OO
stories	?O
and	OU
most	OO
of	OO
our	OO
heroes	OO
were	OO
actually	OO
scientists	OO
and	OO
academics	.O
science	OU
was	OO
about	OO
going	OO
out	OO
into	OO
the	OO
unknown	.O
it	OU
was	OO
about	OO
truly	OO
global	OO
exploration	,O
even	OO
if	OO
there	OO
were	OO
risks	.O
and	OU
so	OO
when	OO
did	OO
it	OO
become	OO
acceptable	OO
to	OO
make	OO
it	OO
difficult	OO
for	OO
science	OO
to	OO
happen	OO
in	OO
unstable	OO
places	?O
and	OU
look	,O
i'm	OU
not	OO
saying	OO
that	OO
all	OO
scientists	OO
should	OO
go	OO
off	OO
and	OO
start	OO
working	OO
in	OO
unstable	OO
places	.O
this	OU
isn't	OO
some	OO
gung	OO
ho	OO
call	.O
but	OU
here's	OO
the	OO
thing:	OO
for	OO
those	OO
who	OO
have	OO
done	OO
the	OO
research	,O
understand	OO
security	OO
protocol	OO
and	OO
are	OO
trained	,O
stop	OO
stopping	OO
those	OO
who	OO
want	OO
to	.O
plus	,U
just	OO
because	OO
one	OO
part	OO
of	OO
a	OO
country	OO
is	OO
an	OO
active	OO
war	OO
zone	OO
doesn't	OO
mean	OO
the	OO
whole	OO
country	OO
is	.O
i'm	OU
not	OO
saying	OO
we	OO
should	OO
go	OO
into	OO
active	OO
war	OO
zones	.O
but	OU
iraqi	OU
kurdistan	OU
looks	OO
very	OO
different	OO
from	OO
fallujah	.U
and	OU
actually	,O
a	OO
few	OO
months	OO
after	OO
i	OU
couldn't	OO
get	OO
into	OO
yemen	,U
another	OO
team	OO
adopted	OO
me	.O
so	OU
professor	OU
graeme	OU
barker's	OU
team	OO
were	OO
actually	OO
working	OO
in	OO
iraqi	OU
kurdistan	,U
and	OO
they	OO
were	OO
digging	OO
up	OO
shanidar	OU
cave	.U
now	,U
shanidar	OU
cave	OU
a	OO
few	OO
decades	OO
earlier	OO
had	OO
unveiled	OO
a	OO
neanderthal	OU
known	OO
as	OO
shanidar	OU
1	.O
now	,U
for	OO
a	OO
bbc/pbs	OU
tv	OU
series	OO
we	OO
actually	OO
brought	OO
shanidar	OU
1	OO
to	OO
life	,O
and	OO
i	OU
want	OO
you	OO
guys	OO
to	OO
meet	OO
ned	,U
ned	OU
the	OO
neanderthal	.U
now	OU
here's	OO
the	OO
coolest	OO
thing	OO
about	OO
ned	.U
ned	,U
this	OO
guy	,O
you're	OO
meeting	OO
him	OO
before	OO
his	OO
injuries	.O
see	,U
it	OO
turned	OO
out	OO
that	OO
ned	OU
was	OO
severely	OO
disabled	.O
he	OU
was	OO
in	OO
fact	OO
so	OO
disabled	OO
that	OO
there	OO
is	OO
no	OO
way	OO
he	OO
could	OO
have	OO
survived	OO
without	OO
the	OO
help	OO
of	OO
other	OO
neanderthals	.U
and	OU
so	OO
this	OO
was	OO
proof	OO
that	,O
at	OO
least	OO
for	OO
this	OO
population	OO
of	OO
neanderthals	OU
at	OO
this	OO
time	,O
neanderthals	OU
were	OO
like	OO
us	,O
and	OO
they	OO
sometimes	OO
looked	OO
after	OO
those	OO
who	OO
couldn't	OO
look	OO
after	OO
themselves	.O
ned's	OU
an	OO
iraqi	OU
neanderthal	.U
so	OU
what	OO
else	OO
are	OO
we	OO
missing	?O
what	OU
incredible	OO
scientific	OO
discoveries	OO
are	OO
we	OO
not	OO
making	OO
because	OO
we're	OO
not	OO
looking	?O
and	OU
by	OO
the	OO
way	,O
these	OO
places	,O
they	OO
deserve	OO
narratives	OO
of	OO
hope	,O
and	OO
science	OO
and	OO
exploration	OO
can	OO
be	OO
a	OO
part	OO
of	OO
that	.O
in	OU
fact	,O
i	OU
would	OO
argue	OO
that	OO
it	OO
can	OO
tangibly	OO
aid	OO
development	,O
and	OO
these	OO
discoveries	OO
become	OO
a	OO
huge	OO
source	OO
of	OO
local	OO
pride	.O
and	OU
that	OO
brings	OO
me	OO
to	OO
the	OO
second	OO
reason	OO
why	OO
science	OO
has	OO
a	OO
geography	OO
problem	.O
see	,U
we	OO
don't	OO
empower	OO
local	OO
academics	,O
do	OO
we	?O
like	,U
it's	OO
not	OO
lost	OO
on	OO
me	OO
that	OO
in	OO
my	OO
particular	OO
field	OO
of	OO
paleoanthropology	OO
we	OO
study	OO
human	OO
origins	,O
but	OO
we	OO
have	OO
so	OO
few	OO
diverse	OO
scientists	.O
and	OU
the	OO
thing	OO
is	,O
these	OO
places	OO
are	OO
full	OO
of	OO
students	OO
and	OO
academics	OO
who	OO
are	OO
desperate	OO
to	OO
collaborate	,O
and	OO
the	OO
truth	OO
is	OO
that	OO
for	OO
them	,O
they	OO
have	OO
fewer	OO
security	OO
issues	OO
than	OO
us	.O
i	OU
think	OO
we	OO
constantly	OO
forget	OO
that	OO
for	OO
them	OO
it's	OO
not	OO
a	OO
hostile	OO
environment;	OO
for	OO
them	OO
it's	OO
home	.O
i'm	OU
telling	OO
you	,O
research	OO
done	OO
in	OO
unstable	OO
places	OO
with	OO
local	OO
collaborators	OO
can	OO
lead	OO
to	OO
incredible	OO
discoveries	,O
and	OO
that	OO
is	OO
what	OO
we	OO
are	OO
hoping	OO
upon	OO
hope	OO
to	OO
do	OO
in	OO
socotra	.U
they	OU
call	OO
socotra	OU
the	OO
most	OO
alien	OO
looking	OO
place	OO
on	OO
earth	,O
and	OO
myself	,O
leon	OU
mccarron	,U
martin	OU
edström	OU
and	OO
rhys	OU
thwaites	OU
jones	OU
could	OO
see	OO
why	.O
i	OU
mean	,O
look	OO
at	OO
this	OO
place	.O
these	OU
places	,O
they're	OO
not	OO
hellholes	,O
they're	OO
not	OO
write	OO
offs	,O
they're	OO
the	OO
future	OO
frontline	OO
of	OO
science	OO
and	OO
exploration	.O
90	OO
percent	OO
of	OO
the	OO
reptiles	OO
on	OO
this	OO

37	OO
percent	OO
of	OO
the	OO

here	OO
and	OO
nowhere	OO

and	OO
that	OO
includes	OO
this	OO
species	OO
of	OO
dragon's	OO
blood	OO

which	OO
actually	OO
bleeds	OO
this	OO

and	OU
there's	OO
something	OO
else	.O
people	OU
on	OO
socotra	,U
some	OO
of	OO
them	OO
still	OO
live	OO
in	OO
caves	,O
and	OO
that	OO
is	OO
really	OO
exciting	,O
because	OO
it	OO
means	OO
if	OO
a	OO
cave	OO
is	OO
prime	OO
real	OO
estate	OO
this	OO
century	,O
maybe	OO
it	OO
was	OO
a	OO
few	OO
thousand	OO
years	OO
ago	.O
but	OU
we	OO
need	OO
the	OO
data	OO
to	OO
prove	OO
it	,O
the	OO
fossils	,O
the	OO
stone	OO
tools	,O
and	OO
so	OO
our	OO
scouting	OO
team	OO
have	OO
teamed	OO
up	OO
with	OO
other	OO
scientists	,O
anthropologists	OO
and	OO
storytellers	,O
international	OO
as	OO
well	OO
as	OO
local	,O
like	OO
ahmed	OU
alarqbi	,U
and	OO
we	OO
are	OO
desperate	OO
to	OO
shed	OO
a	OO
light	OO
on	OO
this	OO
place	OO
before	OO
it's	OO
too	OO
late	.O
and	OU
now	,O
now	OO
we	OO
just	OO
somehow	OO
need	OO
to	OO
get	OO
back	OO
for	OO
that	OO
really	OO
big	OO

i'm	OU

the	OO

and	OU
one	OO
thing	OO
i've	OU

that	,O

the	OO
things	OO
that	OO
we're	OO

actually	OO

in	OO

some	OO

the	OO
opposite	OO
of	OO
the	OO

in	OO
the	OO

tremendous	OO

so	OU
why	OO

most	OU
of	OO
the	OO

that	OO

are	OO

these	OU

it's	OU

these	OO

let	OO

a	OO

this	OU

what's	OU

is	OO
that	OO
recently	,O
there's	OO

now	,U
this	OO
has	OO

in	OO
the	OO

i	OU
want	OO
you	OO
to	OO
remember	OO
a	OO
few	OO
things	OO
as	OO
you	OO

those	OO

this	OO

not	OO
a	OO

in	OO

two	,U
people	OO

some	OO

we're	OO
the	OO
most	OO

country	OO
in	OO
the	OO

it's	OU
not	OO
a	OO
time	OO
to	OO
panic	.O
it's	OU
easy	OO
from	OO
the	OO
safety	OO
of	OO
the	OO

country	OO
to	OO
think	OO
in	OO
terms	OO
of	OO
absolutes:	OO
is	OU
it	OO
legal	,O

is	OO
it	OO

the	OO

with	OO
these	OO

my	OO

how	OU

i	OU

and	OU
if	OO
you	OO
want	OO
absolutes	,O
it's	OO
absolutely	OO
legal	OO
to	OO

it	OU

a	OO

in	OO
our	OO

in	OO

and	,U
in	OO
fact	OO

it	OO
stems	OO
from	OO
the	OO
1951	OO
refugee	OU

which	OO
was	OO
the	OO

another	OU

that	OO

it	OO
for	OO

you’ve	OO

a	OO

your	OU

1	OO

you	,O

the	OO

there’s	OU
one	OO

that	OO

you	,O
though:	OO
dark	OO
matter	OO
fuel	OO
is	OO
stable	OO
in	OO

that	OU
means	OO
you	OO
can	OO
vent	OO
a	OO

of	OO
it	OO
from	OO
your	OO

chamber	,O
and	OO
then	OO
come	OO

even	OU
though	OO
your	OO

you	OO
might	OO
be	OO
able	OO
to	OO
make	OO
it	OO
all	OO
23	OO
parsecs	.O
so	OU
how	OO
can	OO
you	OO

the	OO

answer	OU
in	OO
3	,O
2	,O
1	.O
it’s	OU

to	OO

this	OO

using	OO

no	OU

how	OO
you	OO

the	OO
key	OO
is	OO
determining	OO
exactly	OO
where	OO
to	OO
cache	OO
fuel	OO
along	OO
your	OO
route	.O
let’s	OU
work	OO
backwards	OO
from	OO
the	OO
alien	OO
space	OO
station	.O
to	OU
reach	OO
23	OO
parsecs	,O
you’ll	OO
have	OO
to	OO
leave	OO
the	OO
8	OO
parsec	OO
mark	OO
with	OO
a	OO
full	OO
tank	OO
of	OO
fuel	.O
the	OU
8	OO
parsec	OO
point	OO
is	OO
too	OO
far	OO
from	OO
the	OO
start	OO
to	OO
use	OO
as	OO
a	OO
cache	OO
right	OO
away;	OO
you	OO
could	OO
jump	OO
there	,O
but	OO
wouldn’t	OO
have	OO
enough	OO
fuel	OO
to	OO
return	OO
to	OO
the	OO
start	,O
let	OO
alone	OO
store	OO
any	OO
for	OO
later	.O
so	OU
that	OO
means	OO
you’ll	OO
need	OO
to	OO
find	OO
a	OO
cache	OO
somewhere	OO
between	OO
the	OO
start	OO
and	OO
8	.O
but	OU
where	?O
there’s	OU
an	OO
interesting	OO
pattern	OO
that	OO
can	OO
help	.O
at	OU
the	OO
start	OO
you	OO
have	OO
exactly	OO
3	OO
tanks’	OO
worth	OO
of	OO
fuel	.O
at	OU
8	OO
parsecs	OO
you	OO
need	OO
exactly	OO
1	.O
is	OU
there	OO
a	OO
point	,O
which	OO
we	OO
can	OO
call	OO
point	OO
x	,U
where	OO
you	OO
could	OO
have	OO
exactly	OO
2	?O
that	OU
would	OO
be	OO
useful	,O
because	OO
then	OO
you	OO
could	OO
refuel	OO
there	OO
exactly	OO
twice	,O
making	OO
full	OO
use	OO
of	OO
your	OO
storage	OO
capacity	OO
without	OO
any	OO
waste	.O
wherever	OU
point	OO
x	OU
is	,O
you’ll	OO
jump	OO
forward	OO
from	OO
it	OO
twice:	OO
once	OO
to	OO
deposit	OO
some	OO
fuel	OO
at	OO
the	OO
8	OO
parsec	OO
cache	OO
point	,O
and	OO
a	OO
second	OO
time	OO
for	OO
good	.O
so	OU
you’ll	OO
jump	OO
the	OO
distance	OO
between	OO
x	OU
and	OO
8	OO
parsecs	OO
3	OO
times	OO
in	OO
all	.O
you’d	OU
have	OO
2	OO
tanks	OO
of	OO
fuel	OO
at	OO
point	OO
x	,U
and	OO
need	OO
1	OO
left	OO
at	OO
the	OO
8	OO
parsec	OO
cache	OO
point	,O
so	OO
you	OO
can	OO
spend	OO
one	OO
tank—	OO
or	OO
15	OO
units—	OO
going	OO
back	OO
and	OO
forth	.O
since	OU
15	OO
units	OO
divided	OO
by	OO
3	OO
trips	OO
is	OO
5	,O
we	OO
can	OO
place	OO
these	OO
two	OO
cache	OO
points	OO
5	OO
parsecs	OO
apart	.O
any	OU
farther	,O
and	OO
you	OO
wouldn’t	OO
have	OO
enough	OO
fuel	OO
to	OO
reach	OO
the	OO
alien	OO
space	OO
station	.O
so	OU
it	OO
looks	OO
like	OO
the	OO
earliest	OO
we	OO
can	OO
place	OO
point	OO
x	OU

at	OO
the	OO
3	OO
parsec	OO

is	OU
it	OO
possible	OO
to	OO

30	OO

there	?O
let’s	OU
try	.O
you	OU
set	OO
out	OO
with	OO
a	OO
full	OO
tank	OO
of	OO
15	OO
units	.O
you	OU
jump	OO
3	OO
parsecs	,O
drop	OO
9	OO

off	OO
at	OO
the	OO
cache	OO

and	OO
then	OO
jump	OO
the	OO
3	OO
units	OO
home	,O
arriving	OO
with	OO
an	OO
empty	OO

repeating	OU
this	OO

you	OO
18	OO
units	OO

at	OO
the	OO

with	OO

now	OO
the	OO

you	OU

a	OU

everyone	OO
in	OO
the	OO

we	OU

our	OO

our	OO

by	OO
that	OO

which	OO

we	OO

right	?U
so	OU
here	OO
we	OO
are	OO
in	OO
this	OO

there's	OU
an	OO
infinite	OO

that	OO

about	,O
but	OO
we	OO

we	OU
choose	OO
what	OO
to	OO
think	OO
about	,O
what	OO
to	OO
pay	OO
attention	OO
to	.O
we	OU
make	OO
up	OO
a	OO

to	OO

of	OO
what's	OO
going	OO

and	OO
we	OO
all	OO

because	OU
we're	OO

we	OO

this	,O

a	OO

that	OO
we	OO

even	OO

the	OU

we	OO

thinking	OO
maybe	OO
we	OO
have	OO
to	OO
be	OO

or	OO
that	OO
we	OO
always	OO
have	OO
to	OO
put	OO
other	OO

or	OO
that	OO
we	OO

some	OO
big	OO
terrible	OO
secret	OO
we	OO
couldn't	OO

tell	OO
people	.O
and	OU
it's	OO
just	OO

it's	OO
just	OO

we'd	OO

a	OO

less	OO
about	OO
what	OO

of	OO
us	OO
if	OO
we	OO

how	OO

so	OU
i	OU
feel	OO
that	OO

a	OO
great	OO
analogy	OO
for	OO
how	OO
we	OO

form	OO
a	OO

and	OO
then	OO
mistake	OO
that	OO
story	OO
for	OO
the	OO
truth	,O
and	OO
i've	OU
had	OO
a	OO
20	OO
year	OO
career	OO
in	OO
the	OO
uk	OU
staging	OO
big	OO
psychological	OO
experiments	OO
on	OO

and	OO
now	OO
that's	OO
on	OO

i	OU
also	OO

a	OO

i've	OU

my	OO
first	OO
broadway	OU

actually	OO

just	OU
throwing	OO
that	OO
out	OO
there	.O
no	OU

that	OU

this	OO

and	OU
i	OU
try	OO
to	OO
do	OO
something	OO
new	OO
with	OO

mentalism	,O
which	OO
is	OO
the	OO
dubious	OO
art	OO
of	OO
getting	OO
inside	OO
your	OO

so	OU
there	OO
was	OO
a	OO
heyday	OO
for	OO
this	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
stage	OO
mind	OO
reading	,O
which	OO
was	OO
the	OO
1930s	.O
that's	OU
why	OO
i'm	OU
dressed	OO
like	OO
this	,O
in	OO
my	OO
most	OO
un	OO
ted	OU
like	OO
garb	.O
and	OU
there	OO
was	OO
an	OO
act	,O
an	OO
act	OO
known	OO
as	OO
the	OO
oracle	OU
act	.U
and	OU
in	OO
the	OO
oracle	OU
act	,U
members	OO
of	OO
the	OO
audience	,O
as	OO
i	OU
know	OO
you	OO
have	OO
done	,O
would	OO
write	OO
down	OO
secret	OO
questions	,O
the	OO
sort	OO
of	OO
questions	OO
you	OO
might	OO
ask	OO
a	OO
psychic	,O
seal	OO
that	OO
question	OO
into	OO
an	OO
envelope	,O
and	OO
on	OO
the	OO

of	OO
the	OO

they	OO
would	OO
write	OO
their	OO

and	OO
then	OO
roughly	OO
where	OO
they	OO
sat	OO
in	OO
the	OO
audience	.O
and	OU
then	OO
the	OO
oracle	,U
the	OO
mind	OO
reader	,O
would	OO
take	OO
an	OO
envelope	OO
one	OO
at	OO
a	OO
time	,O
he	OO
wouldn't	OO
open	OO
it	,O
but	OO
he	OO
would	OO
attempt	OO
to	OO
divine	OO
what	OO
question	OO
was	OO
sealed	OO
inside	.O
and	OU
if	OO
he	OO
got	OO
that	OO
right	,O
he	OO
would	OO
try	OO
and	OO
answer	OO
the	OO
question	OO
for	OO
the	OO
person	OO
too	.O
and	OU
the	OO
act	OO
spread	OO
like	OO
wildfire	.O
it's	OU
a	OO
testament	,O
i	OU
think	,O
to	OO
the	OO
seductive	OO
appeal	OO
of	OO
some	OO
powerful	OO
figure	OO
offering	OO
you	OO
easy	,O
simple	OO
answers	OO
to	OO
life's	OO
complex	OO
and	OO
subtle	OO
questions	OO
and	OO
anxieties	.O
so	OU
thank	OO
you	OO
all	OO
of	OO
you	OO
that	OO
wrote	OO
questions	.O
i	OU
haven't	OO
seen	OO
these	.O
i	OU
know	OO
somebody's	OO
guarding	OO
them	.O
thank	OU
you	OO
so	OO
much	.O
i	OU
will	OO
take	OO
those	OO
now	.O
thank	OU
you	OO
all	OO
of	OO
you	OO
that	OO
did	OO
this	.O
i	OU
should	OO
say	,O
probably	,O
a	OO
couple	OO
of	OO
things	OO
before	OO
i	OU
start	.O
in	OU
absolute	OO
honesty	,O
first	OO
of	OO
all	OO
i	OU
can't	OO
see	OO
through	OO
these	OO
envelopes	.O
they	OU
are	OO
sealed	.O
they	OU
are	OO
thick	OO
black	OO
envelopes	.O
you'll	OU
know	OO
if	OO
you	OO
wrote	OO
one	.O
i	OU
can't	OO
see	OO
through	OO
them	.O
secondly	,U
importantly	,O
i	OU
don't	OO
know	OO
any	OO
of	OO
you	OO
and	OO
nobody	OO
is	OO
playing	OO
along	.O
that's	OU
not	OO
what	OO
this	OO
is	.O
thirdly	.U
i	OU
don't	OO
believe	OO
for	OO
a	OO
second	OO
that	OO
i	OU
have	OO
any	OO
special	OO
psychological	OO
gifts	,O
let	OO
alone	OO
any	OO
psychic	OO
ones	.O
so	OU
let's	OO
begin	.O
nope	.U
ok	,U
this	OO
—	OO
oh	,U
nice	.O
ok	,U
this	OO
one's	OO
interesting	.O
there's	OU
a	OO
couple	OO
here	.O
i	OU
will	OO
start	OO
with	OO
maybe	OO
this	OO
one	.O
this	OU
one's	OO
interesting	,O
because	OO
the	OO
writing	OO
undulates	.O
there's	OU
a	OO
sort	OO
of	OO
an	OO
up	OO
and	OO
down	OO
thing	,O
which	OO
normally	OO
—	OO
not	OO
always	OO
—	OO
normally	OO
means	OO
that	OO
the	OO
person	OO
doesn't	OO
know	OO
the	OO
answer	OO
to	OO
the	OO
question	OO
themselves	,O
so	OO
it's	OO
normally	OO
a	OO
question	OO
about	OO
the	OO
future	,O
right	?O
that	OU
sort	OO
of	OO
suggests	OO
uncertainty	.O
so	OU
i	OU
would	OO
say	OO
it's	OO
a	OO
lady	,O
age	OO
wise	OO
it's	OO
a	OO
little	OO
difficult	OO
to	OO
tell	OO
from	OO
this	OO
minimal	OO
handwriting	,O
but	OO
i	OU
would	OO
expect	OO
maybe	OO
30s	,O
maybe	OO
40s	,O
but	OO
let's	OO
find	OO
out	.O
it	OU
says	OO
—	OO
and	OO
a	OO
question	OO
about	OO
the	OO
future	OO
—	OO
it	OO
says	,O
jn	,U
center	.O
so	OU
it's	OO
going	OO
to	OO
be	OO
somebody	OO
in	OO
this	OO
big	OO
central	OO
section	OO
here	.O
if	OU
you	OO
think	OO
this	OO
is	OO
you	,O
if	OO
you	OO
wrote	OO
one	,O
could	OO
you	OO
make	OO
a	OO
fuss	?O
it's	OU
a	OO
bit	OO
difficult	OO
for	OO
me	OO
to	OO
see	OO
in	OO
the	OO
center	.O
hi	,U
give	OO
us	OO
a	OO
wave	.O
so	OU
j	.U
jane	?U
jessica	?U
jessica:	OU
yes	.U
derren	OU
brown:	OU
which	OU
one	?O
jessica:	OU
jessica	.U
db:	OU
thank	OU
you	.O
just	OU
a	OO
guess	.O
little	OU
murmur	OO
of	OO
approval	,O
thank	OO
you	?O
i'll	OU
take	OO
it	.O
alright	,U
so	OO
jessica	,U
i	OU
won't	OO
ask	OO
your	OO
age	,O
but	OO
is	OO
it	OO
a	OO
question	OO
essentially	OO
about	OO
the	OO
future	?O
jessica:	OU
mhm	?U
db:	OU
yes	?U
jessica:	OU
yes	.U
db:	OU
yes	.U
ok	.U
alright	.U
so	OU
what	OO
did	OO
we	OO
ask	?O
what	OU
did	OO
jessica	OU
ask	OO
about	OO
the	OO
future	?O
so	OU
am	OO
i	OU
ok	OU
with	OO
late	OO
30s	,O
early	OO
40s	?O
jessica:	OU
i'll	OU

this	OO

a	OO
lady	OO
who	OO

you're	OO

whether	OO

not	OO
things	OO

ok	,U
i	OU

you	OO
have	OO
a	OO

it's	OO
whether	OO
or	OO
not	OO
you're	OO
going	OO
to	OO

and	OO
get	OO
out	OO

is	OU
this	OO
right	?O
jessica:	OU
absolutely	,U
that's	OO
the	OO
question	.O
db:	OU
alright	.U
great	.U
thank	OU
you	.O
it's	OU
a	OO
great	OO
question	.O
what	OU
was	OO
the	OO
actual	OO
question	?O
what	OU

you	OO

will	OU
i	OU

the	OO
farm	OO
in	OO
virginia	?U
db:	OU
will	OU
you	OO
sell	OO
the	OO
farm	?O
alright	,U
so	OO
look	,O
it's	OO
a	OO
great	OO
question	OO
if	OO
you	OO
are	OO
pretending	OO
to	OO
be	OO
psychic	,O
because	OO
it's	OO
about	OO
the	OO
future	,O
which	OO
means	OO
i	OU
can	OO
give	OO
you	OO
a	OO
yes	OO
or	OO
no	OO
on	OO
this	.O
it	OU
means	OO
nothing	.O
you	OU
have	OO
no	OO
way	OO
of	OO
verifying	OO
it	.O
and	OU
a	OO
dangerous	OO
thing	OO
to	OO
do	OO
—	OO
and	OO
if	OO
i	OU
say	OO
yes	OO
or	OO
no	,O
it'll	OO
just	OO
stick	OO
in	OO
the	OO
back	OO
of	OO
your	OO
mind	,O
and	OO
it	OO
can't	OO
not	OO
start	OO

you	OO
make	.O
so	OU
a	OO
dangerous	OO
thing	OO
to	OO
do	.O
however	OU
—	OO
yes	,U
i	OU
think	OO
you	OO
will	OO
sell	OO
the	OO

you're	OO
the	OO

that's	OO

i	OU

strangely	,O
this	OO
frees	OO
me	OO
up	,O
and	OO
i	OU
want	OO
this	OO
to	OO
free	OO
you	OO
up	OO
as	OO
well	,O
so	OO
if	OO
you	OO
didn't	OO
write	OO
a	OO
question	OO
but	OO
you	OO
wish	OO
that	OO
you	OO
had	OO
done	,O
you	OO
can	OO
still	OO
take	OO

the	OU
point	OO
of	OO

the	OO

only	OO
that	OO
it	OO
just	OO
kind	OO

gets	OO
a	OO

i'll	OU

this	OO

your	OO

the	OO

those	OO

this	OU

the	OO

now	,U
we	OO

we	OO

if	OO

now	,O
there	OO

doing	OO
upstart	OU
at	OO

our	OU
audacious	OO

to	OO
take	OO
upstart	OU
across	OO
the	OO
country	OO
—	OO
not	OO
to	OO

anything;	OO
we	OO
want	OO

we	OU

we	OO

the	OO

the	OO
role	OO
of	OO

to	OO

so	OU
first	OO
we	OO
will	OO
use	OO

go	OO
into	OO
a	OO

to	OO
pilot	OO
the	OO
program	OO
and	OO
get	OO

every	OU
state	OO
believes	OO
it's	OO
unique	OO
and	OO
wants	OO
to	OO
know	OO
that	OO
the	OO
program	OO
will	OO
work	OO
with	OO
its	OO
children	OO
before	OO
investing	.O
then	OU
we	OO
identify	OO
key	OO
leaders	OO
in	OO
the	OO
state	OO
to	OO
help	OO
us	OO
champion	OO
upstart	OU
as	OO
an	OO
option	OO
for	OO
unserved	OO
children	.O
and	OU
together	,O
we	OO
go	OO
to	OO

to	OO
transition	OO
upstart	OU
from	OO

funding	.O
that	OU

—	OO

you	.O
that	OU

worked	OO
in	OO
three	OO

utah	,U
indiana	OU

south	OU

we've	OU
also	OO
piloted	OO
the	OO
program	OO
in	OO
a	OO

and	OO
identified	OO

next	,U
we're	OO
moving	OO
to	OO
states	OO
with	OO
the	OO
greatest	OO
geographic	OO
barriers	OO
to	OO
work	OO
the	OO
plan	,O
and	OO
then	OO
on	OO
to	OO
states	OO
that	OO
already	OO
have	OO
early	OO

but	OO
may	OO
not	OO

getting	OO
great	OO
academic	OO
results	OO
or	OO
great	OO
parent	OO
buy	OO
in	OO
to	OO

from	OU
there	,O
we	OO
go	OO
to	OO
the	OO

that	OO

going	OO
to	OO
require	OO
the	OO
most	OO

and	OO
work	OO

we'll	OO
hope	OO
our	OO

the	OO

there	.O
we	OU
will	OO
serve	OO
a	OO
quarter	OO
of	OO
a	OO
million	OO
children	OO
in	OO
five	OO

and	OO
we	OO

that	OO

here's	OU
how	OO
you	OO
can	OO
help:	OO
for	OO
two	OO

we	OO
can	OO
provide	OO
a	OO
child	OO
with	OO
upstart	,U
a	OO

and	OO
that	OO

will	OO

the	OO

that	OO
makes	OO
certain	OO
other	OO

get	OO
upstart	OU
in	OO
the	OO

we	OU
also	OO
need	OO

say	OO
just	OO
how	OO
easy	OO
it	OO

to	OO

you	OU

we're	OO

the	OU

that	OO
our	OO

about	OO

not	OO
just	OO
for	OO
myself	OO
but	OO
for	OO
so	OO
many	OO

maybe	OU
it's	OO
because	OO
my	OO

a	OO

my	OO

were	OO

the	OO

it	OO

decided	OO
to	OO

what's	OO

the	OO
part	OO

that's	OO

the	OO
fact	OO
that	OO
60	OO

to	OO
be	OO

when	OU
i	OU
say	OO
60	OO
percent	OO
are	OO
preventable	,O
i	OU
mean	OO
there	OO
are	OO
concrete	OO
steps	OO
and	OO
standard	OO

that	OO
we	OO

that	OO
could	OO
prevent	OO
these	OO

and	OU
it	OO
doesn't	OO
require	OO
fancy	OO

we	OU
just	OO
have	OO
to	OO
apply	OO
what	OO
we	OO
know	OO
and	OO
ensure	OO
equal	OO
standards	OO
between	OO

for	OU

if	OO
a	OO
pregnant	OO
woman	OO
in	OO

has	OO
really	OO
high	OO

we	OO
treat	OO
her	OO
with	OO
the	OO
right	OO
antihypertensive	OO
medication	OO
in	OO
a	OO

fashion	,O
we	OO
can	OO
prevent	OO

if	OU
we	OO
accurately	OO
track	OO
blood	OO

during	OO
delivery	,O
we	OO
can	OO
detect	OO
a	OO

sooner	OO
and	OO
save	OO
a	OO

life	.O
we	OU
could	OO
actually	OO
lower	OO
the	OO
rates	OO
of	OO
these	OO

events	OO
tomorrow	,O
but	OO
it	OO

that	OO

value	OO
the	OO

we	OO

to	OO

women	OO
before	,O
during	OO
and	OO
after	OO

if	OU
we	OO
raise	OO
quality	OO
of	OO
care	OO
universally	OO
to	OO
what	OO
is	OO
supposed	OO
to	OO
be	OO
the	OO
standard	,O
we	OO
could	OO
bring	OO
the	OO

of	OO
these	OO

making	OO

a	OU
few	OO
years	OO

the	OO
american	OU

what's	OO

let's	OU
take	OO
the	OO
example	OO
of	OO
a	OO
hemorrhage	OO
bundle	.O
for	OU
a	OO
hemorrhage	,O
you	OO
need	OO
a	OO
cart	OO
that	OO
has	OO
everything	OO
a	OO
doctor	OO
or	OO
nurse	OO
might	OO
need	OO
in	OO
an	OO
emergency:	OO
an	OO
iv	OU
line	,O
an	OO
oxygen	OO
mask	,O
medications	,O
checklists	,O
other	OO
equipment	.O
then	OU
you	OO
need	OO
something	OO
to	OO
measure	OO
blood	OO
loss:	OO
sponges	OO
and	OO
pads	.O
and	OU
instead	OO
of	OO
just	OO
eyeballing	OO
it	,O
the	OO
doctors	OO
and	OO
nurses	OO
collect	OO
these	OO
sponges	OO
and	OO
pads	OO
and	OO
either	OO
weigh	OO
them	OO
or	OO
use	OO
newer	OO
technology	OO
to	OO
accurately	OO
assess	OO
how	OO
much	OO
blood	OO
has	OO
been	OO
lost	.O
the	OU
hemorrhage	OO
bundle	OO
also	OO
includes	OO
crises	OO
protocols	OO
for	OO
massive	OO
transfusions	OO
and	OO
regular	OO
trainings	OO
and	OO

now	,U
california	OU
has	OO
been	OO
a	OO
leader	OO
in	OO
the	OO
use	OO
of	OO
these	OO
types	OO
of	OO
bundles	,O
and	OO
that's	OO
why	OO
california	OU
saw	OO
a	OO
21	OO
percent	OO
reduction	OO
in	OO
near	OO
death	OO
from	OO
hemorrhage	OO
among	OO

that	OO

this	OO

in	OO
the	OO
first	OO

yet	OU
the	OO
use	OO
of	OO
these	OO
bundles	OO
across	OO
the	OO
country	OO
is	OO
spotty	OO

just	OU

the	OO
fact	OO
that	OO
the	OO

of	OO

and	OO
the	OO
emphasis	OO
on	OO

differs	OO
from	OO

the	OO
next	,O

quality	OO

for	OO

it's	OU

that	OO

i	OU

to	OO
tell	OO
you	OO

today	.O
that's	OU
pretty	OO

it	.O
i'm	OU
going	OO
to	OO
tell	OO
you	OO

and	OO
we	OO
will	OO
derive	OO
whatever	OO

we	OO
may	OO
from	OO
these	OO
four	OO
jokes	.O
before	OU
i	OU
tell	OO
you	OO
the	OO
first	OO
joke	,O
as	OO
we	OO
are	OO
in	OO
munich	,U
i'd	OU
like	OO
to	OO
conduct	OO
a	OO
little	OO
experiment	.O
some	OU
terrible	OO
things	OO
are	OO
said	OO
about	OO
the	OO
german	OU
sense	OO
of	OO
humor	OO
specifically	OO
that	OO
you	OO
don't	OO
have	OO
one	.O
and	OU
i'd	OU
like	OO
to	OO
put	OO
this	OO
horrible	OO
assumption	OO
to	OO
the	OO
test	OO
and	OO
do	OO
an	OO
experiment	.O
so	OU
when	OO
i	OU
tell	OO
this	OO
first	OO
joke	,O
i	OU
would	OO
ask	OO
that	OO
only	OO
the	OO
german	OU
people	OO
here	OO
respond	.O
to	OU
either	OO
laugh	OO
or	OO
not	OO
laugh	,O
as	OO
you	OO
see	OO

but	OU
please	,O
don't	OO
force	OO
yourself	OO
to	OO
laugh	OO
to	OO
skew	OO
the	OO
results	.O
this	OU
is	OO
a	OO
scientific	OO
experiment	,O
it's	OO
terribly	OO
serious	.O
so	OU
here	OO
is	OO
the	OO
first	OO
joke	.O
there	OU
is	OO
a	OO
man	,O
he	OO
is	OO
dying	OO
in	OO
his	OO

in	OO
his	OO

and	OO
he	OO

from	OO

the	OO

it's	OU
the	OO
smell	OO
of	OO
his	OO

chocolate	OO

and	OU
with	OO
his	OO

he	OO

he	OO

him	,O

they	OO

finally	OO
that	OO
the	OO

a	OO

so	,U
now	OO
a	OO

for	OO
you:	OO
those	OO

you	OO

the	OO

and	OU
why	OO
should	OO
that	OO

for	OU
me	,O
the	OO

is	OO
that	OO

is	OO
not	OO
the	OO

to	OO
the	OO

of	OO

the	OU

that	OO

any	OO

this	OO
question	OO

for	OO

and	OU
the	OO
best	OO
of	OO
them:	OO
plato	,U
freud	,U
wittgenstein	,U

here	OU
is	OO
what	OO
they	OO
came	OO
up	OO
with	.O
they	OU
said	OO
that	OO
the	OO
reason	OO
we	OO

is	OO
our	OO
ancient	OO

that's	OU
the	OO
best	OO
they	OO

that	OO
we	OO

because	OO
it's	OO
our	OO
ancient	OO
response	OO
to	OO
the	OO
passing	OO
of	OO
animal	OO
danger	,O
from	OO
which	OO
i	OU
think	,O
people	,O
we	OO
could	OO
conclude	OO
that	OO
asking	OO
a	OO
philosopher	OO
to	OO
define	OO
comedy	OO
is	OO
like	OO
asking	OO
stevie	OU
wonder	OU
to	OO
help	OO
you	OO
find	OO
your	OO
car	OO
keys	.O
just	OU
as	OO
you	OO
cannot	OO
have	OO
a	OO
mathematical	OO
proof	OO
that	OO

you	OO

a	OO
theory	OO
of	OO

so	OU
let's	OO

again	.O
let's	OU
try	OO
here	OO
today	OO
to	OO
define	OO
comedy	,O
better	OO
than	OO
plato	,U
and	OO
nietzsche	,U
and	OO
freud	.U
i've	OU

i	OU

one	.O
it's	OU
1,000	OO

you	OU

to	OO

the	OO

up	OO

to	OO

that	OO
1,000	OO
years	OO

that	OO
was	OO
a	OO
killer	.O
but	OU
it	OO
does	OO
teach	OO
us	OO
something	OO
interesting	OO
about	OO
comedy:	OO
that	OO
to	OO
understand	OO
a	OO

you	OO
have	OO
to	OO
belong	OO
to	OO
the	OO
parish	.O
let	OU
me	OO
tell	OO
you	OO
what	OO

mean	.O
to	OU

a	OO

you	OO
have	OO
to	OO

you	OO

getting	OO
the	OO

you	OO

anything	OO
that	OO

the	OO

that	OO

you	OO
a	OO
little	OO

about	.O

you	OO

that	OO
there's	OO
two	OO

then	OO
there's	OO
this	OO

statement:	OO
we	OU
came	OO
in	OO
peace	OO
for	OO
all	OO
mankind	.O
now	,U
at	OO
first	,O
this	OO
is	OO
just	OO
nice	OO
poetic	OO
language	,O
but	OO
it's	OO
also	OO
set	OO
in	OO
a	OO
typeface	OO
that's	OO
perfect	OO
for	OO
this	OO
moment	.O
it	OU
seems	OO
industrial	,O
it	OO
seems	OO
engineered	.O
it	OU
also	OO
is	OO
the	OO
best	OO
possible	OO
name	OO
you	OO
could	OO
come	OO
up	OO
with	OO
for	OO
something	OO
on	OO
the	OO
moon:	OO
futura	.U
now	,U
i	OU
want	OO
to	OO
talk	OO
to	OO
you	OO
about	OO
fonts	,O
and	OO
why	OO
this	OO
typeface	OO
is	OO
perfect	OO
for	OO
this	OO
moment	.O
but	OU
it's	OO
actually	OO
more	OO
than	OO
just	OO
ceremonial	.O
now	,U
when	OO
all	OO
of	OO
you	OO
arrived	OO
here	OO
today	,O
you	OO
actually	OO
had	OO
to	OO
think	OO
about	OO
fonts	.O
you	OU
might	OO
not	OO
realize	OO
it	,O
but	OO
you're	OO
all	OO
unconscious	OO
experts	OO
on	OO
typography	.O
typography	OU
is	OO
the	OO
study	OO
of	OO
how	OO
fonts	OO
inhabit	OO
our	OO
world	,O
they're	OO
the	OO
visual	OO
language	OO
of	OO
the	OO
words	OO
we	OO
use	.O
here's	OU
the	OO
thing	OO
that's	OO
funny	OO
about	OO
this	,O
though	.O
i	OU
know	OO
you're	OO
probably	OO
not	OO
like	OO
me	,O
you're	OO
not	OO
a	OO
font	OO
nerd	,O
maybe	OO
some	OO
of	OO
you	OO
are	,O
but	OO
if	OO
you're	OO
not	,O
that's	OO
alright	,O
because	OO
i	OU
might	OO
spend	OO
hours	OO
every	OO
day	OO
trying	OO
to	OO
pick	OO
the	OO
perfect	OO
typeface	OO
for	OO
the	OO
perfect	OO
project	,O
or	OO
i	OU
might	OO
spend	OO
thousands	OO
of	OO
dollars	OO
every	OO
year	,O
trying	OO
to	OO
get	OO
ones	OO
with	OO
the	OO
right	OO
features	.O
but	OU
all	OO
of	OO
you	OO
actually	OO
spend	OO
hours	OO
every	OO
day	,O
evaluating	OO
fonts	.O
if	OU
you	OO
don't	OO
believe	OO
me	,O
think	OO
about	OO
how	OO
you	OO
got	OO
here	.O
each	OU
of	OO
you	OO
had	OO
to	OO
judge	OO
by	OO
the	OO
signs	OO
and	OO
maybe	OO
even	OO
on	OO
your	OO
phone	,O
which	OO
signals	OO
to	OO
trust	OO
and	OO
which	OO
to	OO
ignore	.O
you	OU
were	OO
evaluating	OO
fonts	.O
or	OU
maybe	OO
when	OO
you're	OO
just	OO
buying	OO
a	OO
new	OO
product	,O
you	OO
have	OO
to	OO
think	OO
about	OO
whether	OO
something	OO
is	OO
expensive	OO
or	OO
cheap	OO
or	OO
hard	OO
to	OO
get	OO
or	OO
easy	OO
to	OO
find	.O
and	OU
the	OO
funny	OO
thing	OO
about	OO
it	OO
is	,O
this	OO
may	OO
not	OO
seem	OO
extraordinary	OO
to	OO
you	,O
but	OO
the	OO
moment	OO
you	OO
see	OO
something	OO
out	OO

you	OO
recognize	OO
it	OO
right	OO
away	.O
the	OU
thing	OO
i	OU
love	OO
about	OO
typography	,O
and	OO
why	OO
i	OU
love	OO
fonts	OO
and	OO
why	OO
i	OU
love	OO
futura	,U
is	OO
that	,O
for	OO
me	,O
what	OO
i	OU
study	OO
is	OO
everywhere	.O
every	OU

that	OO
i	OU

down	,O
every	OO

now	,U
once	OO
you	OO

the	OO

what	OO

with	OO

you	OO

a	OO
history	OO
of	OO
everything	OO
before	OO
you	.O
and	OU
this	OO
is	OO
the	OO
typeface	OO
futura	.U
as	OU
previously	OO
we've	OO
discussed	,O
this	OO
is	OO
modernism	OO
in	OO
miniature	.O
this	OU
is	OO
a	OO
way	OO
in	OO
which	OO
modernism	OO
infiltrated	OO
this	OO
country	OO
and	OO
became	OO
perhaps	OO
the	OO
most	OO
popular	,O
or	OO
promiscuous	OO
typeface	,O
of	OO
the	OO
twentieth	OO
century	.O
less	OU

more	,O
right	,O
these	OO
are	OO
the	OO
aphorisms	OO
of	OO
modernism	.O
and	OU
in	OO
the	OO

the	OO

let's	OU
focus	OO
on	OO
the	OO
essentials	,O
focus	OO
on	OO
the	OO
basic	OO
shapes	,O
focus	OO
on	OO
geometry	.O
so	OU
futura	OU
actually	OO
holds	OO
this	OO
to	OO
its	OO
core	.O
you	OU
might	OO
notice	OO
that	OO
the	OO
shapes	OO

in	OO

have	OO
circles	,O
squares	,O
triangles	.O
some	OU
of	OO
the	OO
shapes	OO
are	OO
all	OO
based	OO
on	OO
circles	,O
like	OO
the	OO
o	,U
d	OU
and	OO
c	,U
or	OO
others	OO
have	OO
this	OO
pointed	OO
apex	OO
of	OO
the	OO

others	OU
just	OO
look	OO
like	OO
they	OO
might	OO
have	OO
been	OO
made	OO
with	OO
a	OO
ruler	OO
or	OO
a	OO
compass	.O
they	OU
feel	OO
geometric	,O
they	OO
feel	OO
mathematic	,O
precise	.O
in	OU
fact	,O
this	OO
whole	OO
system	OO
carries	OO
through	OO
with	OO
the	OO
way	OO
that	OO
the	OO
typeface	OO
was	OO
designed	.O
to	OU
not	OO
look	OO
like	OO
it	OO
was	OO
made	OO
like	OO
other	OO
typefaces	,O
to	OO
be	OO
something	OO
new	.O
here	OU
it	OO
is	OO
in	OO
the	OO
lightweight	,O
the	OO
medium	OO
weight	OO
and	OO
the	OO
bold	OO
weight	.O
the	OU
whole	OO
family	OO
has	OO
different	OO
things	OO
to	OO
commend	OO
to	OO
it	.O
this	OU
was	OO
a	OO
conscious	OO
break	OO
from	OO
the	OO
past	,O
something	OO
that	OO
looked	OO
like	OO
it	OO
was	OO
made	OO
by	OO
a	OO
machine	,O
and	OO
not	OO
by	OO
hand	.O
when	OU
i	OU
say	OO
not	OO
made	OO
by	OO

this	OO
is	OO
what	OO
i	OU
mean	.O
this	OU
is	OO
what	OO
we	OO
think	OO
about	OO
maybe	,O
when	OO
you	OO
might	OO
create	OO
something	OO
with	OO
a	OO
calligraphic	OO
brush	OO
or	OO
a	OO
pen	.O
that	OU
there's	OO
thicks	OO
and	OO
thins	.O
and	OU
even	OO
more	OO
traditional	OO
typefaces	,O
say	OO
like	OO
a	OO
garamond	,U
holds	OO
vestiges	OO
of	OO
this	OO
old	OO
system	OO
in	OO
which	OO
you	OO
can	OO
see	OO
the	OO
a	OU
where	OO
it	OO
get	OO
little	OO
bit	OO
thinner	OO
at	OO
the	OO
top	OO
and	OO
thicker	OO
down	OO
below	,O
because	OO
it's	OO
trying	OO
to	OO
look	OO
like	OO
someone	OO
had	OO
made	OO
it	OO
by	OO
hand	.O
but	OU
futura	,U
in	OO
contrast	,O
is	OO
designed	OO
to	OO
look	OO
like	OO
no	OO
one	OO
had	OO
touched	OO
it	OO
at	OO
all	,O
that	OO
this	OO
was	OO
made	OO
by	OO
a	OO
machine	,O
for	OO
a	OO
machine	OO
age	,O
for	OO
an	OO
industrial	OO
age	.O
there's	OU
actually	OO
a	OO
sleight	OO
of	OO
hand	OO
here	OO
that	OO
paul	OU
renner	,U
the	OO
designer	OO
who	OO
made	OO
this	OO
in	OO
1927	,O
employed	.O
if	OU
you	OO
look	OO
at	OO
the	OO
way	OO
in	OO
which	OO
the	OO
circular	OO
shape	OO
joins	OO
with	OO
the	OO
vertical	OO
shaft	,O
you'll	OO
notice	OO
that	OO
it	OO
tapers	OO
just	OO
every	OO
so	OO
slightly	.O
and	OU
this	OO
is	OO
one	OO
of	OO
hundreds	OO
of	OO
ways	OO
in	OO
which	OO
this	OO
typeface	OO
was	OO
designed	OO
to	OO
look	OO
geometrically	OO
perfect	,O
even	OO
though	OO
it's	OO
mathematically	OO
not	.O
and	OU
this	OO
is	OO
what	OO
typeface	OO
designers	OO
do	OO
all	OO
the	OO
time	OO
to	OO
make	OO
typefaces	OO
work	,O
every	OO
day	.O
now	,U
there	OO
were	OO
other	OO
designers	OO
doing	OO
this	OO
at	OO
the	OO
same	OO
time	OO
in	OO
europe	OU
and	OO
america	.U
these	OU
are	OO
a	OO
few	OO
other	OO
excellent	OO
examples	OO
from	OO
europe	,U
trying	OO
to	OO
create	OO
something	OO
new	OO
for	OO
the	OO
new	OO
age	,O
a	OO
new	OO
moment	OO
in	OO
time	.O
these	OU
are	OO
some	OO
other	OO
ones	OO
in	OO
germany	OU
that	OO
in	OO
some	OO
ways	OO
look	OO
very	OO
similar	OO
to	OO
futura	,U
maybe	OO
with	OO
higher	OO
waist	OO
or	OO
lower	OO
waist	OO
or	OO
different	OO
proportions	.O
then	OU
why	OO
did	OO
futura	OU
take	OO
over	OO
the	OO
world	?O
in	OU
this	OO
case	,O
if	OO
you	OO
can	OO
read	OO
the	OO
titles	OO
there	,O
some	OO
of	OO
these	OO
names	OO
don't	OO
quite	OO
roll	OO
off	OO
the	OO
tongue:	OO
erbar	,U
kabel	OU
light	,U
berthold	OU
grotesk	,U
elegant	OU
grotesk	.U
these	OU
aren't	OO
exactly	OO
household	OO
names	,O
are	OO
they	?O
and	OU
so	OO
when	OO
you	OO
compare	OO
that	OO
to	OO
futura	,U
you	OO
realize	OO
that	OO
this	OO
was	OO
a	OO
really	OO
good	OO
choice	OO
by	OO
the	OO
marketing	OO
team	.O
what's	OU
amazing	OO
about	OO
this	OO
name	OO
—	OO
you	OO
know	,O
what's	OO
in	OO
this	OO
name	OO
is	OO
that	OO
this	OO
is	OO
a	OO
name	OO
that	OO
actually	OO
invokes	OO
hope	OO
and	OO
an	OO
idea	OO
about	OO
the	OO
future	.O
and	OU
this	OO
isn't	OO
actually	OO
the	OO
word	OO
for	OO
future	OO
in	OO
german	,U
it	OO
wasn't	OO
a	OO
german	OU
name	,O
they	OO
actually	OO
picked	OO
something	OO
that	OO
would	OO
speak	OO
to	OO
a	OO
wider	,O
larger	OO
audience	,O
a	OO
universal	OO
audience	.O
and	OU
when	OO
you	OO
compare	OO
it	OO
to	OO
what	OO
was	OO
being	OO
done	OO
in	OO
america	OU
—	OO
these	OO
are	OO
the	OO
typefaces	OO
from	OO
the	OO
same	OO
period	OO
in	OO
the	OO
united	OU
states	OU
in	OO
the	OO
1920s	,O
bold	,O
brash	,O
braggadocios	.O
you	OU
almost	OO
think	OO
of	OO
this	OO
as	OO
exactly	OO
like	OO
what	OO
the	OO
stock	OO
market	OO
looked	OO
like	OO
when	OO
they	OO
were	OO
all	OO
going	OO
nuts	OO
in	OO
the	OO
1920s	.O
and	OU
you	OO
realize	OO
that	OO
futura	OU
is	OO
doing	OO
something	OO
revolutionary	.O
i	OU
want	OO
to	OO
step	OO
back	OO
and	OO
talk	OO
about	OO
an	OO
example	OO
of	OO
the	OO
typeface	OO
in	OO
use	.O
so	OU
this	OO
is	OO
a	OO
magazine	OO
that	OO
we	OO
all	OO
probably	OO
know	OO
today	,O
vanity	OU
fair	.U
this	OU
is	OO
what	OO
it	OO
looked	OO
like	OO
in	OO
1929	,O
in	OO
the	OO
summer	.O
and	OU
in	OO
many	OO
ways	,O
there's	OO
nothing	OO
wrong	OO
with	OO
this	OO
design	.O
this	OU
is	OO
absolutely	OO
typical	OO
of	OO
the	OO
1920s	.O
there's	OU
a	OO
photograph	OO
of	OO
an	OO
important	OO
person	,O
in	OO
this	OO
case	OO
franklin	OU
roosevelt	,U
then	OO
governor	OO
of	OO
new	OU
york	.U
everything	OU
seems	OO
centered	,O
everything	OO
seems	OO
symmetrical	.O
there's	OU
still	OO
a	OO
little	OO
bit	OO
of	OO
ornamentation	,O
so	OO
this	OO
is	OO
still	OO
maybe	OO
having	OO
some	OO
vestiges	OO
of	OO
the	OO
painted	OO
lady	OO
and	OO
not	OO
fully	OO
modernistic	.O
but	OU
everything	OO
seems	OO
kid	OO
of	OO
solid	.O
there's	OU
even	OO
drop	OO
caps	OO
to	OO
help	OO
you	OO
get	OO
into	OO
the	OO
text	.O
but	OU
this	OO
all	OO
changed	OO
very	OO
quickly	OO
and	OO
in	OO
october	OU
of	OO
1929	,O
a	OO
berlin	OU
based	OO
designer	OO
came	OO
and	OO
redesigned	OO
vanity	OU
fair	.U
and	OU
this	OO
is	OO
what	OO
it	OO
looks	OO
like	OO
with	OO
futura	.U
instead	OU
of	OO
the	OO
governor	OO
now	OO
we	OO
have	OO
a	OO
photograph	OO
of	OO
an	OO
abstract	,O
beautiful	OO
setting	,O
in	OO
this	OO
case	,O
the	OO
ocean	.O
instead	OU
of	OO
drop	OO
caps	,O
there's	OO
nothing	OO
at	OO
all	.O
and	OU
replaced	OO
with	OO
a	OO
centered	OO
layout	OO
is	OO
now	OO
asymmetry	.O
and	OU
it	OO
gets	OO
even	OO
more	OO
radical	OO
the	OO
further	OO
you	OO
enter	OO
the	OO
magazine	.O
in	OU
this	OO
case	,O
even	OO
more	OO
dramatic	OO
asymmetry	.O
in	OU
this	OO
case	,O
illustrations	OO
by	OO
pablo	OU

moving	OO
across	OO
the	OO
page	OO
and	OO

the	OO

of	OO
the	OO

and	OU
there's	OO
something	OO
even	OO
more	OO
radical	.O
if	OU
you	OO
look	OO
closely	OO
at	OO
the	OO
futura	,U
you	OO
might	OO
notice	OO
something	.O
you	OU
might	OO
not	OO
pick	OO
it	OO
up	OO
at	OO

there	OO
are	OO
no	OO

the	OO

you	OU

easily	.O
this	OU
is	OO
still	OO
a	OO
radical	OO
idea	.O
and	OU
why	OO
is	OO
that	OO
radical	?O
when	OU
we	OO
think	OO
about	OO
what	OO
capital	OO
letters	OO
denote	,O
they	OO
denote	OO
something	OO
important	,O
whether	OO
it's	OO
our	OO
names	,O
or	OO
our	OO
titles	.O
or	OU
maybe	OO
even	OO
just	OO
the	OO
name	OO
of	OO
our	OO
corporations	,O
or	OO
maybe	OO
our	OO
trademarks	.O
actually	,U
in	OO
some	OO
ways	,O
america's	OU
the	OO
home	OO
of	OO
capitalization	.O
we	OU
love	OO
putting	OO
capitals	OO
in	OO
everything	.O
but	OU
think	OO
about	OO
how	OO
radical	OO
this	OO
would	OO
be	OO
to	OO
introduce	OO
a	OO
magazine	OO
where	OO
you're	OO
taking	OO
away	OO
all	OO
the	OO
capital	OO
letters	.O
this	OU
has	OO
maybe	OO
had	OO
the	OO
same	OO
political	OO
force	OO
that	OO
we	OO
now	OO
argue	OO
over	OO
things	OO
like	OO
pronouns	OO
in	OO
our	OO
society	OO
today	.O
in	OU
the	OO
1920s	,O
this	OO
is	OO
just	OO
shortly	OO
after	OO
soviet	OU
russia	OU
had	OO
a	OO
communist	OO
revolution	.O
and	OU
for	OO
them	,O
this	OO
actually	OO
represented	OO
a	OO
socialist	OO
infiltration	OO
into	OO
america	.U
all	OU
lowercase	OO
letters	OO
meant	OO
that	OO
this	OO
was	OO
an	OO
egalitarian	,O
complete	OO
lowering	OO
of	OO
everything	OO
into	OO
one	OO
equal	OO
playing	OO
field	.O
now	OU
this	OO
is	OO
still	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
a	OO
radical	OO
idea	.O
think	OU
about	OO
how	OO
often	OO
you	OO
do	OO
capitalize	OO
something	OO
to	OO
have	OO
more	OO
power	OO
or	OO
prestige	OO
to	OO
it	.O
so	OU
for	OO
them	OO
to	OO
do	OO
this	OO
was	OO
a	OO
way	OO
in	OO
which	OO
futura	OU
was	OO
using	OO
this	OO
idea	.O
now	,U
other	OO
designers	OO
were	OO
doing	OO
other	OO
things	OO
with	OO
futura	.U
others	OU
brought	OO
other	OO
ideas	OO
of	OO
modernism	OO
with	OO
it	,O
whether	OO
it	OO
was	OO
interesting	OO
new	OO
illustration	OO
styles	,O
or	OO
interesting	OO
new	OO
collage	OO
types	OO
of	OO
illustration	.O
or	OU
even	OO
just	OO
new	OO
book	OO
covers	,O
whether	OO
they	OO
were	OO
from	OO
europe	.U
but	OU
here's	OO
the	OO
funny	OO
thing	.O
in	OU
the	OO
1920s	,O
if	OO
you	OO
wanted	OO
to	OO
use	OO
a	OO
new	OO
typeface	,O
you	OO
couldn't	OO
just	OO
go	OO
download	OO
it	OO
onto	OO
your	OO
computer	.O
you	OU
actually	OO
had	OO
to	OO
have	OO
pieces	OO
of	OO
lead	.O
so	OU
for	OO
americans	OU
who	OO
wanted	OO
to	OO
adopt	OO
this	OO
and	OO
make	OO
it	OO
part	OO
of	OO
their	OO
own	OO
system	,O
something	OO
they	OO
could	OO
use	OO
in	OO
everyday	OO
typography	,O
whether	OO
in	OO
ads	OO
or	OO
anything	OO
else	,O
they	OO
actually	OO
had	OO
to	OO
have	OO
metal	OO
type	.O
so	OU
being	OO
good	OO
american	OU
capitalists	,O
what	OO
did	OO
we	OO
do	?O
we	OU
made	OO
all	OO
sorts	OO
of	OO
copies	.O
ones	OU
that	OO
had	OO
nothing	OO
to	OO
do	OO
with	OO
the	OO
name	OO
futura	,U
but	OO
looked	OO
identical	OO
to	OO
it	,O
whether	OO
it	OO
was	OO
spartan	OU
or	OO
tempo	.U
and	OU
in	OO
fact	,O
by	OO
the	OO
time	OO
that	OO
world	OU
war	OU
ii	OU
started	,O
american	OU
corporations	OO
were	OO
actually	OO
trying	OO
to	OO
boycott	OO
nazi	OU
goods	.O
but	OU
they	OO
said	,O
go	OU
ahead	OO
and	OO
use	OO
our	OO
copies	.O
use	OU
20th	OO
century	,U
use	OO
spartan	,U
use	OO
vogue	,U
use	OO
tempo	.U
these	OU
are	OO
identical	OO
to	OO
futura	.U
and	OU
in	OO
fact	,O
for	OO
most	OO
people	,O
they	OO
didn't	OO
even	OO
learn	OO
the	OO
new	OO
names	,O
they	OO
just	OO
still	OO
called	OO
it	OO
all	OO
futura	.U
so	OU
america	OU
took	OO
this	OO
typeface	OO
in	,O
conquered	OO
it	OO
and	OO
made	OO
it	OO
its	OO
own	.O
so	OU
by	OO
the	OO
time	OO
world	OU
war	OU
ii	OU
finishes	,O
americans	OU
are	OO
using	OO
this	OO
on	OO
everything	,O
whether	OO
it	OO
be	OO
catalogs	,O
or	OO
atlases	,O
or	OO
encyclopedias	OO
or	OO
charts	OO
and	OO
graphs	,O
or	OO
calendars	,O
or	OO
even	OO
political	OO
material	.O
and	OU
even	OO
the	OO
logo	OO
for	OO
a	OO
new	OO
expansion	OO
football	OO
team	.O
and	OU
in	OO
fact	,O
it	OO
was	OO
used	OO
even	OO
on	OO
some	OO
of	OO
the	OO
most	OO
important	OO
advertising	OO
of	OO
the	OO
20th	OO
century	.O
so	OU
it's	OO
in	OO
this	OO
context	OO
that	OO
when	OO
the	OO
us	OU
government	OO
was	OO
picking	OO
a	OO
typeface	OO
to	OO
use	OO
after	OO
world	OU
war	OU
ii	OU
for	OO
new	OO
maps	OO
and	OO
new	OO
projects	,O
they	OO
picked	OO
futura	.U
it	OU
wasn't	OO
an	OO
astounding	OO
choice	,O
it	OO
wasn't	OO
a	OO
radical	OO
choice	,O
it	OO
didn't	OO
have	OO
anything	OO
to	OO
do	OO
with	OO
communism	.O
but	OU
in	OO
this	OO
case	,O
it	OO
was	OO
used	OO
on	OO
some	OO
of	OO
the	OO
most	OO
important	OO
maps	,O
so	OO
this	OO
one	,O
an	OO
air	OO
force	OO
map	OO
in	OO
1962	,O
or	OO
used	OO
for	OO
the	OO
maps	OO
in	OO
vietnam	OU
in	OO
'66	.O
and	OU
so	OO
it	OO
wasn't	OO
a	OO
surprise	OO
that	OO
when	OO
astronauts	OO
first	OO
started	OO
the	OO
mercury	OU
program	,O
such	OO
as	OO
john	OU
glenn	OU
orbiting	OO
the	OO
earth	,O
that	OO
charts	OO
and	OO
maps	OO
that	OO
he	OO
was	OO
using	OO
were	OO
in	OO
futura	.U
and	OU
in	OO
fact	,O
by	OO
the	OO
time	OO
mercury	OU
morphed	OO
into	OO
apollo	,U
it	OO
started	OO
getting	OO
used	OO
more	OO
and	OO
more	OO
for	OO
more	OO
things	.O
so	OU
in	OO
this	OO
case	OO
for	OO
a	OO
safety	OO
plan	,O
or	OO
even	OO
starting	OO
to	OO
get	OO
used	OO
on	OO
instrument	OO
panels	,O
or	OO
navigational	OO
aids	.O
or	OU
even	OO
on	OO
diagrams	OO
to	OO
show	OO
how	OO
the	OO
whole	OO
system	OO
worked	.O
but	OU
here's	OO
the	OO
amazing	OO
thing	,O
it	OO
didn't	OO
just	OO
get	OO
used	OO
for	OO
papers	OO
that	OO
they	OO
handed	OO
out	OO
to	OO
people	.O
it	OU
started	OO
to	OO
get	OO
used	OO
for	OO
an	OO
interface	,O
for	OO
an	OO
entire	OO
system	OO
that	OO
helped	OO
the	OO
astronauts	OO
know	OO
how	OO
to	OO
use	OO
the	OO
machine	.O
nasa	OU
wasn't	OO
just	OO
one	OO
big	OO
corporation	OO
making	OO
everything	.O
there	OU
was	OO
hundreds	OO
of	OO
contractors	OO
—	OO
boeing	,U
ibm	,U
mcdonnell	OU
douglas	OU
—	OO
all	OO
making	OO
different	OO
machines	.O
now	OU
imagine	OO
if	OO
astronauts	OO
had	OO
to	OO
use	OO
different	OO
typefaces	OO
and	OO
different	OO
systems	OO
for	OO
each	OO
component	OO
they	OO
had	OO
in	OO
the	OO
space	OO
shuttles	.O
this	OU
would	OO
have	OO
been	OO
impossible	OO
to	OO
navigate	OO
and	OO
there	OO
would	OO
have	OO
been	OO
a	OO
cognitive	OO
overload	OO
every	OO
time	OO
they	OO
had	OO
to	OO
open	OO
up	OO
a	OO
new	OO
system	.O
so	OU
in	OO
this	OO
case	,O
futura	OU
being	OO
used	OO
on	OO
the	OO
interface	OO
helped	OO
them	OO
navigate	OO
complexity	OO
and	OO
make	OO
it	OO
more	OO
clear	.O
and	OU
it	OO
wasn't	OO
just	OO
used	OO
on	OO
buttons	,O
it	OO
was	OO
used	OO
on	OO
labels	,O
and	OO
it	OO
was	OO
used	OO
on	OO
their	OO
food	OO
rations	,O
and	OO
it	OO
was	OO
used	OO
on	OO
their	OO
tool	OO
kits	.O
it	OU
was	OO
used	OO
on	OO
knobs	OO
and	OO
levers	OO
to	OO
tell	OO
them	OO
what	OO
to	OO
do	.O
in	OU
fact	,O
maybe	OO
even	OO
some	OO
of	OO
the	OO
places	OO
where	OO
they	OO
needed	OO
to	OO
have	OO
things	OO
that	OO
were	OO
complex	OO
be	OO
more	OO
simple	OO
to	OO
them	,O
instructions	OO
were	OO
printed	OO
entirely	OO
in	OO
futura	,U
so	OO
that	OO
they	OO
could	OO
know	OO
what	OO
to	OO
do	OO
with	OO
that	OO
one	OO
moment	.O
they	OU
didn't	OO
have	OO
to	OO

everything	OO
in	OO

they	OO

have	OO
it	OO
out	OO
there	OO
in	OO
the	OO
world	OO
to	OO
see	OO
and	OO
refer	OO
to	.O
in	OU
this	OO
case	,O

helped	OO
make	OO
that	OO
system	,O
which	OO
was	OO
already	OO
a	OO
very	OO
difficult	OO
and	OO
complex	OO
system	,O
a	OO
little	OO

in	OU

the	OO
very	OO
first	OO

an	OO

seen	OO
when	OO
they	OO

exiting	OO
the	OO
spacecraft	OO
would	OO
have	OO
been	OO
in	OO
futura	.U
one	OU
of	OO
my	OO
favorite	OO
examples	OO
of	OO
how	OO
futura	OU
worked	OO
in	OO
this	OO
way	OO
is	OO
actually	OO
this	OO
camera	.O
this	OU
is	OO
a	OO
hasselblad	OU
that	OO
was	OO
made	OO
by	OO
the	OO
swedish	OU
company	.O
it's	OU
a	OO
perfectly	OO
good	OO
camera	,O
some	OO
of	OO
you	OO
might	OO
have	OO
used	OO
one	,O
it's	OO
prized	OO
by	OO
photographers	OO
as	OO
a	OO
really	OO
great	OO
camera	.O
and	OU
you	OO
might	OO
notice	,O
if	OO
you	OO
know	OO
anything	OO
about	OO
cameras	,O
that	OO
there's	OO
some	OO
modifications	OO
made	OO
to	OO
it	.O
in	OU
this	OO
case	,O
there	OO
are	OO
stickers	OO
placed	OO
all	OO
over	OO
the	OO
film	OO
canisters	,O
or	OO
other	OO
parts	OO
of	OO
the	OO
camera	OO
here	.O
what	OU
this	OO
enabled	OO
nasa	OU
to	OO
do	,O
was	OO
make	OO
something	OO
really	OO
great	OO
out	OO
of	OO
the	OO
astronauts	.O
they're	OU
not	OO
photographers	,O
they're	OO
not	OO
experts	OO
in	OO
art	.O
but	OU
they	OO
could	OO
ensure	OO
that	OO
they	OO
would	OO
know	OO
how	OO
to	OO
use	OO
this	OO
camera	OO
because	OO
of	OO
the	OO
labels	OO
placed	OO
there	OO
in	OO
futura	.U
so	OU
in	OO
this	OO
case	,O
futura	OU
acquired	OO
and	OO
made	OO
sure	OO
that	OO
they	OO
had	OO
legitimacy	OO
with	OO
the	OO
things	OO
they	OO
were	OO

in	OU
this	OO
case	OO
to	OO
not	OO
take	OO
off	OO
the	OO

which	,U
in	OO
this	OO

we	OO
would	OO

some	OO
of	OO
the	OO
amazing	OO

we	OO

this	,O
a	OO
ceremonial	OO
patch	,O
or	OO
something	OO
like	OO
this	OO

we	OO

that	OO

was	OO
more	OO
than	OO
just	OO
something	OO

something	OO
more	OO
than	OO
something	OO
that	OO

because	OO
of	OO
this	OO
choice	.O
there's	OU
one	OO
other	OO
thing	OO
i	OU
want	OO
to	OO
talk	OO
about	OO

that	OO

that	OO

a	OO

this	OO

what	OO

love	OO
about	OO

is	OO
that	OO
all	OO
of	OO
them	OO
tell	OO
stories	.O
and	OU
in	OO
this	OO
case	,O
this	OO
typeface	OO
tells	OO
a	OO
very	OO
powerful	OO
story	OO
about	OO
assimilation	,O
about	OO
something	OO
being	OO
taken	OO
into	OO
america	OU
and	OO
being	OO
made	OO
part	OO
of	OO
its	OO

and	OU
that's	OO
one	OO
of	OO
the	OO
best	OO
and	OO
worst	OO
things	OO
america	OU
does	,O
is	OO
we	OO
take	OO
things	OO
into	OO
our	OO
culture	OO
and	OO
we	OO
spit	OO
them	OO
out	OO
back	OO
again	OO
and	OO
claim	OO
them	OO
our	OO

and	OU
in	OO
this	OO

exactly	OO
what	OO

with	OO
the	OO

undergirding	OO
the	OO

was	OO
a	OO
german	OU
typeface	,O
taken	OO

and	OU
in	OO
this	OO

when	OO
you	OO
think	OO
about	OO
this	OO

you	OO
realize	OO
that	OO

this	OO

the	OU

goes	OO
across	OO
the	OO

on	OO
a	OO

the	OO

the	OO

an	OO

it's	OU
a	OO
deliberate	,O

city	,O
a	OO
formal	OO
city	.O
and	OU
it's	OO
a	OO
city	OO
that	OO

on	OO
the	OO

very	OO
lightly	.O
it	OU
sits	OO
on	OO
the	OO

there	OU

used	OO
to	OO

this	OO

what's	OU
also	OO
quite	OO
incredible	OO
is	OO
that	OO
there	OO
are	OO
five	OO
materials	OO
that	OO
are	OO
used	OO
to	OO
build	OO
this	OO
settlement	OO
for	OO
seven	OO

a	OO

and	OU
these	OO
materials	OO
come	OO
together	OO
and	OO

it's	OU
like	OO
a	OO
kit	OO
of	OO
parts	.O
and	OU
it's	OO
used	OO
all	OO
the	OO
way	OO
from	OO
a	OO
small	OO
tent	,O
which	OO
might	OO
house	OO
five	OO
or	OO
six	OO
people	,O
or	OO
a	OO
family	,O
to	OO

that	OO
can	OO
house	OO
500	,O
sometimes	OO
1,000	OO
people	.O
and	OU
this	OO
kit	OO
of	OO
parts	,O
and	OO
this	OO
imagination	OO
of	OO
the	OO
city	,O
allows	OO
it	OO
to	OO
be	OO
disassembled	.O
and	OU
so	OO
at	OO
the	OO
end	OO
of	OO
the	OO

within	OO
a	OO
week	,O
the	OO
entire	OO
city	OO
is	OO
disassembled	.O
these	OU
are	OO
again	OO
images	OO
from	OO
the	OO

spot	.O
and	OU
the	OO
terrain	OO

offered	OO
back	OO
to	OO
the	OO
river	,O
as	OO
with	OO
the	OO
monsoon	OO
the	OO
water	OO

again	.O
and	OU
it's	OO
this	OO
sort	OO
of	OO
imagination	OO
as	OO
a	OO
kit	OO
of	OO
parts	OO
that	OO
allows	OO
this	OO
disassembly	OO
and	OO
the	OO
reabsorption	OO
of	OO
all	OO
this	OO
material	.O
so	OU
the	OO
electricity	OO
poles	OO
go	OO
to	OO
little	OO
villages	OO
in	OO
the	OO

the	OO

in	OO

the	OO
material	OO

it's	OO
amazing	.O
now	,U
you	OO
may	OO
embrace	OO
these	OO

not	.O

you	OO

this	OO
is	OO
a	OO

example	,O
and	OO
it's	OO
worthy	OO
of	OO
reflection	.O
here	,U
human	OO
beings	OO
spend	OO
an	OO
enormous	OO
amount	OO
of	OO
energy	OO
and	OO
imagination	OO
knowing	OO
that	OO
the	OO

going	OO
to	OO

it's	OO
going	OO
to	OO
be	OO

it's	OO

it's	OO
the	OO

it	OO

about	OO
how	OO
to	OO

about	OO

about	OO

amazing	.O
and	OU
you	OO
know	,O
we	OO
are	,O
as	OO

obsessed	OO
with	OO

we	OU
resist	OO

it's	OU
an	OO
impulse	OO
that	OO
we	OO
all	OO
have	.O
and	OU
we	OO
resist	OO

in	OO

of	OO
the	OO
fact	OO
that	OO

the	OO

everything	OU

an	OO

the	OO

for	.O
twenty	OU
years	OO
ago	,O
my	OO
family	OO
introduced	OO
a	OO
system	OO
called	OO
friday	OU
democracy	OU
meetings	.U
every	OU
friday	OU
at	OO
7pm	,O
my	OO
family	OO
came	OO
together	OO
for	OO
an	OO
official	OO
meeting	OO
to	OO
discuss	OO
the	OO
current	OO
family	OO
affairs	.O
these	OU
meetings	OO
were	OO
facilitated	OO
by	OO
one	OO
of	OO
my	OO
parents	,O
and	OO
we	OO
even	OO
had	OO
a	OO
notetaker	.O
these	OU
meetings	OO
had	OO
two	OO
rules	.O
first	,U
you	OO
are	OO
allowed	OO
to	OO
speak	OO
open	OO
and	OO
freely	.O
us	OU
kids	OO
were	OO
allowed	OO
to	OO
criticize	OO
our	OO
parents	OO
without	OO
that	OO
being	OO
considered	OO
disrespectful	OO
or	OO
rude	.O
second	OU
rule	OO
was	OO
the	OO
chatham	OU
house	OU
rule	,O
meaning	OO
whatever	OO
is	OO
said	OO
in	OO
the	OO
meeting	OO
stays	OO
in	OO
the	OO
meeting	.O
the	OU
topics	OO
which	OO
were	OO
discussed	OO
in	OO
these	OO
meetings	OO
varied	OO
from	OO
one	OO
week	OO
to	OO
another	.O
one	OU
week	,O
we'd	OO
talk	OO
about	OO
what	OO
food	OO
we	OO
wanted	OO
to	OO
eat	,O
what	OO
time	OO
us	OO
kids	OO
should	OO
go	OO
to	OO
bed	OO
and	OO
how	OO
to	OO
improve	OO
things	OO
as	OO
a	OO
family	,O
while	OO
another	OO
meeting	OO
discussed	OO
pretty	OO
much	OO
events	OO
that	OO
happened	OO
at	OO
school	OO
and	OO
how	OO
to	OO
solve	OO
disputes	OO
between	OO
siblings	,O
by	OO
which	OO
i	OU
mean	OO
real	OO
fights	.O
at	OU
the	OO
end	OO
of	OO
each	OO
meeting	,O
we'd	OO
reach	OO
decisions	OO
and	OO
agreements	OO
that	OO
would	OO
last	OO
at	OO
least	OO
until	OO
the	OO
next	OO
meeting	.O
so	OU
you	OO
could	OO
say	OO
i	OU
was	OO
raised	OO
as	OO
a	OO
politician	.O
by	OU
the	OO
age	OO
of	OO
six	OO
or	OO
seven	,O
i	OU
mastered	OO
politics	.O
i	OU
was	OO
negotiating	,O
compromising	,O
building	OO
alliances	OO
with	OO
other	OO
political	OO
actors	.O
and	OU
i	OU
even	OO
once	OO
tried	OO
to	OO
jeopardize	OO
the	OO
political	OO
process	.O
these	OU
meetings	OO
sound	OO
very	OO
peaceful	,O
civil	OO
and	OO
democratic	,O
right	?O
but	OU
that	OO
was	OO
not	OO
always	OO
the	OO
case	.O
because	OU
of	OO
this	OO
open	,O
free	OO
space	OO
to	OO
talk	,O
discuss	OO
and	OO
criticize	,O
things	OO
sometimes	OO
got	OO
really	OO
heated	.O
one	OU
meeting	OO
went	OO
really	OO
bad	OO
for	OO
me	.O
i	OU
was	OO
about	OO
10	OO
years	OO
old	OO
at	OO
that	OO
time	,O
and	OO
i'd	OU
done	OO
something	OO
really	OO
horrible	OO
at	OO
school	,O
which	OO
i'm	OU
not	OO
going	OO
to	OO
share	OO
today	OO
—	OO
but	OO
my	OO
brother	OO
decided	OO
to	OO
bring	OO
it	OO
up	OO
in	OO
the	OO
meeting	.O
i	OU
could	OO
not	OO
defend	OO
myself	,O
so	OO
i	OU
decided	OO
to	OO
withdraw	OO
from	OO
the	OO
meeting	OO
and	OO
boycott	OO
the	OO
whole	OO
system	.O
i	OU
literally	OO
wrote	OO
an	OO
official	OO
letter	OO
and	OO
handed	OO
it	OO
to	OO
my	OO
dad	,O
announcing	OO
that	OO
i	OU
am	OO
boycotting	.O
i	OU
thought	OO
that	OO
if	OO
i	OU
stopped	OO
attending	OO
these	OO
meetings	OO
anymore	,O
the	OO
system	OO
would	OO
collapse	,O
but	OO
my	OO
family	OO
continued	OO
with	OO
the	OO
meetings	,O
and	OO
they	OO
often	OO
made	OO
decisions	OO
that	OO
i	OU
disliked	.O
but	OU
i	OU
could	OO
not	OO
challenge	OO
these	OO
decisions	,O
because	OO
i	OU
was	OO
not	OO
attending	OO
the	OO
meetings	,O
and	OO
thus	OO
had	OO
no	OO
right	OO
to	OO
go	OO
against	OO
it	.O
ironically	,U
when	OO
i	OU
turned	OO
about	OO
13	OO
years	OO
old	,O
i	OU
ended	OO
up	OO
attending	OO
one	OO
of	OO
these	OO
meetings	OO
again	,O
after	OO
i	OU
boycotted	OO
them	OO
for	OO
a	OO
long	OO
time	.O
because	OU
there	OO
was	OO
an	OO
issue	OO
that	OO
was	OO
affecting	OO
me	OO
only	,O
and	OO
no	OO
other	OO
family	OO
member	OO
was	OO
bringing	OO
it	OO
up	.O
the	OU
problem	OO
was	OO
that	OO
after	OO
each	OO
dinner	,O
i	OU
was	OO
always	OO
the	OO
only	OO
one	OO
who	OO
was	OO
asked	OO
to	OO
wash	OO
the	OO
dishes	,O
while	OO
my	OO
brothers	OO
didn't	OO
have	OO
to	OO
do	OO
anything	OO
about	OO
it	.O
i	OU
felt	OO
this	OO
was	OO
unjust	,O
unfair	OO
and	OO
discriminatory	,O
so	OO
i	OU
wanted	OO
to	OO
discuss	OO
it	OO
in	OO
the	OO
meeting	.O
as	OU
you	OO
know	,O
the	OO
idea	OO
that	OO
it's	OO
a	OO
woman	OO
or	OO
a	OO
girl's	OO
role	OO
to	OO
do	OO
household	OO
work	OO
is	OO
a	OO
rule	OO
that	OO
has	OO
been	OO
carried	OO
out	OO
by	OO
many	OO
societies	OO
for	OO
so	OO
long	,O
so	OO
in	OO
order	OO
for	OO
a	OO
13	OO
year	OO
old	OO
me	OO
to	OO
challenge	OO
it	,O
i	OU
needed	OO
a	OO
platform	.O
in	OU
the	OO
meeting	,O
my	OO
brothers	OO
argued	OO
that	OO
none	OO
of	OO
the	OO
other	OO
boys	OO
we	OO
knew	OO
were	OO
washing	OO
the	OO
dishes	,O
so	OO
why	OO
should	OO
our	OO
family	OO
be	OO
any	OO
different	?O
but	OU
my	OO
parents	OO
agreed	OO
with	OO
me	OO
and	OO
decided	OO
that	OO
my	OO
brothers	OO
should	OO
assist	OO
me	.O
however	,U
they	OO
could	OO
not	OO
force	OO
them	,O
so	OO
the	OO
problem	OO
continued	.O
seeing	OU
no	OO
solution	OO
to	OO
my	OO
problem	,O
i	OU
decided	OO
to	OO
attend	OO
another	OO
meeting	OO
and	OO
propose	OO
a	OO
new	OO
system	OO
that	OO
would	OO
be	OO
fair	OO
to	OO
everyone	.O
so	OU
i	OU
suggested	OO
instead	OO
of	OO
one	OO
person	OO
washing	OO
all	OO
the	OO
dishes	OO
used	OO
by	OO
all	OO
the	OO
family	OO
members	,O
each	OO
family	OO
member	OO
should	OO
wash	OO
their	OO
own	OO
dishes	.O
and	OU
as	OO
a	OO
gesture	OO
of	OO
good	OO
faith	,O
i	OU
said	OO
i'd	OU
wash	OO
the	OO
pots	OO
as	OO
well	.O
this	OU
way	,O
my	OO
brothers	OO
could	OO
no	OO
longer	OO
argue	OO
that	OO
it	OO
wasn't	OO
within	OO
their	OO
responsibility	OO
as	OO
boys	OO
or	OO
men	OO
to	OO
wash	OO
the	OO
dishes	OO
and	OO
clean	OO
after	OO
the	OO
family	,O
because	OO
the	OO
system	OO
i	OU
proposed	OO
was	OO
about	OO
every	OO
member	OO
of	OO
the	OO
family	OO
cleaning	OO
after	OO
themselves	OO
and	OO
taking	OO
care	OO
of	OO
themselves	.O
everyone	OU
agreed	OO
to	OO
my	OO
proposal	,O
and	OO
for	OO
years	,O
that	OO
was	OO
our	OO
washing	OO
the	OO
dishes	OO
system	.O
what	OU
i	OU
just	OO
shared	OO
with	OO
you	OO
is	OO
a	OO
family	OO
story	,O
but	OO
it's	OO
pure	OO
politics	.O
every	OU
part	OO
of	OO
politics	OO
includes	OO
decision	OO
making	,O
and	OO
ideally	,O
the	OO
process	OO
of	OO
decision	OO
making	OO
should	OO
include	OO
people	OO
from	OO
different	OO
backgrounds	,O
interests	,O
opinions	,O
gender	,O
beliefs	,O
race	,O
ethnicity	,O
age	,O
and	OO
so	OO
on	.O
and	OU
they	OO
should	OO
all	OO
have	OO
an	OO
equal	OO
opportunity	OO
to	OO
contribute	OO
to	OO
the	OO
decision	OO
making	OO
process	OO
and	OO
influence	OO
the	OO
decisions	OO
that	OO
will	OO
affect	OO
their	OO
lives	OO
directly	OO
or	OO
indirectly	.O
as	OU
such	,O
i	OU
find	OO
it	OO
difficult	OO
to	OO
understand	OO
when	OO
i	OU
hear	OO
young	OO
people	OO
saying	,O
i'm	OU
too	OO
young	OO
to	OO
engage	OO
in	OO
politics	OO
or	OO
to	OO
even	OO
hold	OO
a	OO
political	OO
opinion	.O
similarly	,U
when	OO
i	OU
hear	OO
some	OO
women	OO
saying	,O
politics	OU
is	OO
a	OO
dirty	OO
world	OO
i	OU
don't	OO
want	OO
to	OO
engage	OO
with	,O
i'm	OU
worried	OO
that	OO
the	OO
idea	OO
of	OO
politics	OO
and	OO
political	OO
engagement	OO
has	OO
become	OO
so	OO
polarized	OO
in	OO
many	OO
parts	OO
of	OO
the	OO
world	OO
that	OO
ordinary	OO
people	OO
feel	,O
in	OO
order	OO
for	OO
them	OO
to	OO
participate	OO
in	OO
politics	,O
they	OO
need	OO
to	OO
be	OO
outspoken	OO
activists	,O
and	OO
that	OO
is	OO
not	OO
true	.O
i	OU
want	OO
to	OO
ask	OO
these	OO

ordinary	OO
people	OO
in	OO
general:	OO
can	OU
you	OO
really	OO
afford	OO
not	OO
to	OO
be	OO
interested	OO
or	OO
not	OO
to	OO
participate	OO
in	OO
politics	?O
politics	OU
is	OO
not	OO
only	OO
activism	.O
it's	OU
awareness	,O
it's	OO
keeping	OO
ourselves	OO
informed	,O
it's	OO
caring	OO
for	OO
the	OO
facts	.O
when	OU
it's	OO
possible	,O
it's	OO
casting	OO
a	OO
vote	.O
politics	OU

the	OO

ourselves	OO

politics	OU

you	OO

you	OO

when	OO

the	OU

because	OU
if	OO

yes	OO
—	OO
we	,O
as	OO
women	OO
and	OO
young	OO
people	,O
have	OO
no	OO
political	OO
experience	OO
at	OO
all	.O
now	,U
politicians	OO
might	OO
not	OO
be	OO
the	OO
only	OO
ones	OO
to	OO
blame	,O
because	OO
ordinary	OO
people	,O
and	OO
many	OO
young	OO
people	OO
as	OO
well	,O
don't	OO
care	OO
about	OO
politics	.O
and	OU
even	OO
those	OO
who	OO
care	OO
don't	OO
know	OO
how	OO
to	OO
participate	.O
this	OU
must	OO
change	,O
and	OO
here	OO
is	OO
my	OO
proposal	.O
we	OU
need	OO
to	OO
teach	OO
people	OO
at	OO
an	OO
early	OO
age	OO
about	OO
decision	OO
making	OO
and	OO
how	OO
to	OO
be	OO
part	OO
of	OO
it	.O
every	OU
family	OO
is	OO
its	OO
own	OO
mini	OO
political	OO
system	OO
that	OO
is	OO
usually	OO
not	OO
democratic	,O
because	OO
parents	OO
make	OO
decisions	OO
that	OO
affect	OO
all	OO
members	OO
of	OO
the	OO
family	,O
while	OO
the	OO
kids	OO
have	OO
very	OO
little	OO
to	OO
say	.O
similarly	,U
politicians	OO
make	OO
decisions	OO
that	OO
affect	OO
the	OO
whole	OO
nation	,O
while	OO
the	OO
people	OO
have	OO
very	OO
little	OO
say	OO
in	OO
them	.O
we	OU
need	OO
to	OO
change	OO
this	,O
and	OO
in	OO
order	OO
to	OO
achieve	OO
this	OO
change	OO
systematically	,O
we	OO
need	OO
to	OO
teach	OO
people	OO
that	OO
political	,O
national	OO
and	OO
global	OO
affairs	OO
are	OO
as	OO
relevant	OO
to	OO
them	OO
as	OO
personal	OO
and	OO
family	OO
affairs	.O
so	OU
if	OO
we	OO
want	OO
to	OO
achieve	OO
this	,O
my	OO
proposal	OO
and	OO
advice	OO
is	,O
try	OO
out	OO
the	OO
family	OU
democracy	OU
meeting	OU
system	.O
because	OU
that	OO
will	OO
enable	OO
your	OO
kids	OO
to	OO
exercise	OO
their	OO
agency	OO
and	OO
decision	OO
making	OO
from	OO
a	OO
very	OO
early	OO
age	.O
politics	OU
is	OO
about	OO
having	OO
conversations	,O
including	OO
difficult	OO
conversations	,O
that	OO
lead	OO
to	OO
decisions	.O
and	OU
in	OO
order	OO
to	OO
have	OO
a	OO
conversation	,O
you	OO
need	OO
to	OO
participate	,O
not	OO
sign	OO
off	OO
like	OO
i	OU
did	OO
when	OO
i	OU
was	OO
a	OO
kid	OO
and	OO
then	OO
learn	OO
the	OO
lesson	OO
the	OO
hard	OO
way	OO
and	OO
have	OO
to	OO
go	OO
back	OO
again	.O
if	OU
you	OO
include	OO
your	OO
kids	OO
in	OO
family	OO
conversations	,O
they	OO
will	OO
grow	OO
up	OO
and	OO
know	OO
how	OO
to	OO
participate	OO
in	OO
political	OO
conversations	.O
and	OU
most	OO
importantly	,O
most	OO
importantly	,O
they	OO
will	OO
help	OO
others	OO
engage	.O
thank	OU
you	.O
today	,U
actually	,O
is	OO
a	OO
very	OO
special	OO
day	OO
for	OO
me	,O
because	OO
it	OO
is	OO
my	OO
birthday	.O
and	OU
so	,O
thanks	OO
to	OO
all	OO
of	OO
you	OO
for	OO
joining	OO
the	OO
party	.O
but	OU
every	OO
time	OO
you	OO
throw	OO
a	OO
party	,O
there's	OO
someone	OO
there	OO
to	OO
spoil	OO
it	.O
right	?U
and	OU
i'm	OU
a	OO
physicist	,O
and	OO
this	OO
time	OO
i	OU
brought	OO
another	OO
physicist	OO
along	OO
to	OO
do	OO
so	.O
his	OU
name	OO
is	OO
albert	OU
einstein	OU
—	OO
also	OO
albert	OU
—	OO
and	OO
he's	OO
the	OO
one	OO
who	OO
said	OO
that	OO
the	OO
person	OO
who	OO
has	OO
not	OO
made	OO
his	OO
great	OO
contributions	OO
to	OO
science	OO
by	OO
the	OO
age	OO
of	OO
30	OO
will	OO
never	OO
do	OO
so	.O
now	,U
you	OO
don't	OO
need	OO
to	OO
check	OO
wikipedia	OU
that	OO
i'm	OU
beyond	OO
30	.O
so	,U
effectively	,O
what	OO
he	OO
is	OO
telling	OO
me	,O
and	OO
us	,O
is	OO
that	OO
when	OO
it	OO
comes	OO
to	OO
my	OO
science	,O
i'm	OU
deadwood	.O
well	,U
luckily	,O
i	OU
had	OO
my	OO
share	OO
of	OO
luck	OO
within	OO
my	OO
career	.O
around	OU
age	OO
28	,O
i	OU
became	OO
very	OO
interested	OO
in	OO
networks	,O
and	OO
a	OO
few	OO
years	OO
later	,O
we	OO
managed	OO
to	OO
publish	OO
a	OO
few	OO
key	OO
papers	OO
that	OO
reported	OO
the	OO
discovery	OO
of	OO
scale	OO
free	OO
networks	OO
and	OO
really	OO
gave	OO
birth	OO
to	OO
a	OO
new	OO
discipline	OO
that	OO
we	OO
call	OO
network	OO
science	OO
today	.O
and	OU
if	OO
you	OO
really	OO
care	OO
about	OO
it	,O
you	OO
can	OO
get	OO
a	OO
phd	OU
now	OO
in	OO
network	OO
science	OO
in	OO
budapest	,U
in	OO
boston	,U
and	OO
you	OO
can	OO
study	OO
it	OO
all	OO
over	OO
the	OO
world	.O
a	OU
few	OO
years	OO
later	,O
when	OO
i	OU
moved	OO
to	OO
harvard	OU
first	OO
as	OO
a	OO
sabbatical	,O
i	OU
became	OO
interested	OO
in	OO
another	OO
type	OO
of	OO
network:	OO
that	OO
time	,O
the	OO
networks	OO
within	OO
ourselves	,O
how	OO
the	OO
genes	OO
and	OO
the	OO
proteins	OO
and	OO
the	OO
metabolites	OO
link	OO
to	OO
each	OO
other	OO
and	OO
how	OO
they	OO
connect	OO
to	OO
disease	.O
and	OU
that	OO
interest	OO
led	OO
to	OO
a	OO
major	OO
explosion	OO
within	OO
medicine	,O
including	OO
the	OO
network	OU
medicine	OU
division	OU
at	OO
harvard	,U
that	OO
has	OO
more	OO
than	OO
300	OO
researchers	OO
who	OO
are	OO
using	OO
this	OO
perspective	OO
to	OO
treat	OO
patients	OO
and	OO
develop	OO
new	OO
cures	.O
and	OU
a	OO
few	OO
years	OO
ago	,O
i	OU
thought	OO
that	OO
i	OU
would	OO
take	OO
this	OO
idea	OO
of	OO
networks	OO
and	OO
the	OO
expertise	OO
we	OO
had	OO
in	OO
networks	OO
in	OO
a	OO
different	OO
area	,O
that	OO
is	,O
to	OO
understand	OO
success	.O
and	OU
why	OO
did	OO
we	OO
do	OO
that	?O
well	,U
we	OO
thought	OO
that	,O
to	OO
some	OO
degree	,O
our	OO
success	OO
is	OO
determined	OO
by	OO
the	OO
networks	OO
we're	OO
part	OO
of	OO
—	OO
that	OO
our	OO
networks	OO
can	OO
push	OO
us	OO
forward	,O
they	OO
can	OO
pull	OO
us	OO
back	.O
and	OU
i	OU
was	OO
curious	OO
if	OO
we	OO
could	OO
use	OO
the	OO
knowledge	OO
and	OO
big	OO
data	OO
and	OO
expertise	OO
where	OO
we	OO
develop	OO
the	OO
networks	OO
to	OO
really	OO
quantify	OO
how	OO
these	OO
things	OO
happen	.O
this	OU
is	OO
a	OO
result	OO
from	OO
that	.O
what	OU
you	OO
see	OO
here	OO
is	OO
a	OO
network	OO
of	OO
galleries	OO
in	OO
museums	OO
that	OO
connect	OO
to	OO
each	OO
other	.O
and	OU
through	OO
this	OO
map	OO
that	OO
we	OO
mapped	OO
out	OO
last	OO
year	,O
we	OO
are	OO
able	OO
to	OO
predict	OO
very	OO
accurately	OO
the	OO
success	OO
of	OO
an	OO
artist	OO
if	OO
you	OO
give	OO
me	OO
the	OO
first	OO
five	OO
exhibits	OO
that	OO
he	OO
or	OO
she	OO
had	OO
in	OO
their	OO
career	.O
well	,U
as	OO
we	OO
thought	OO
about	OO
success	,O
we	OO
realized	OO
that	OO
success	OO
is	OO
not	OO
only	OO
about	OO
networks;	OO
there	OO
are	OO
so	OO
many	OO
other	OO
dimensions	OO
to	OO
that	.O
and	OU
one	OO
of	OO
the	OO
things	OO
we	OO
need	OO
for	OO
success	,O
obviously	,O
is	OO
performance	.O
so	OU
let's	OO
define	OO
what's	OO
the	OO
difference	OO
between	OO
performance	OO
and	OO
success	.O
well	,U
performance	OO
is	OO
what	OO
you	OO
do:	OO
how	OO
fast	OO
you	OO
run	,O
what	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
paintings	OO
you	OO
paint	,O
what	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
papers	OO
you	OO
publish	.O
however	,U
in	OO
our	OO
working	OO
definition	,O
success	OO
is	OO
about	OO
what	OO
the	OO
community	OO
notices	OO
from	OO
what	OO
you	OO
did	,O
from	OO
your	OO
performance:	OO
how	OU
does	OO
it	OO
acknowledge	OO
it	,O
and	OO
how	OO
does	OO
it	OO
reward	OO
you	OO
for	OO
it	?O
in	OU
other	OO
terms	,O
your	OO
performance	OO
is	OO
about	OO
you	,O
but	OO
your	OO
success	OO
is	OO
about	OO
all	OO
of	OO
us	.O
and	OU
this	OO
was	OO
a	OO
very	OO
important	OO
shift	OO
for	OO
us	,O
because	OO
the	OO
moment	OO
we	OO
defined	OO
success	OO
as	OO
being	OO
a	OO
collective	OO
measure	OO
that	OO
the	OO
community	OO
provides	OO
to	OO
us	,O
it	OO
became	OO
measurable	,O
because	OO
if	OO
it's	OO
in	OO
the	OO
community	,O
there	OO
are	OO
multiple	OO
data	OO
points	OO
about	OO
that	.O
so	OU
we	OO
go	OO
to	OO
school	,O
we	OO
exercise	,O
we	OO
practice	,O
because	OO
we	OO
believe	OO
that	OO
performance	OO
leads	OO
to	OO
success	.O
but	OU
the	OO
way	OO
we	OO
actually	OO
started	OO
to	OO
explore	,O
we	OO
realized	OO
that	OO
performance	OO
and	OO
success	OO
are	OO
very	,O
very	OO
different	OO
animals	OO
when	OO
it	OO
comes	OO
to	OO
the	OO
mathematics	OO
of	OO
the	OO
problem	.O
and	OU
let	OO
me	OO
illustrate	OO
that	.O
so	OU
what	OO
you	OO
see	OO
here	OO
is	OO
the	OO
fastest	OO
man	OO
on	OO
earth	,O
usain	OU
bolt	.U
and	OU
of	OO
course	,O
he	OO
wins	OO
most	OO
of	OO
the	OO
competitions	OO
that	OO
he	OO
enters	.O
and	OU
we	OO
know	OO
he's	OO
the	OO
fastest	OO
on	OO
earth	OO
because	OO
we	OO
have	OO
a	OO
chronometer	OO
to	OO
measure	OO
his	OO
speed	.O
well	,U
what	OO
is	OO
interesting	OO
about	OO
him	OO
is	OO
that	OO
when	OO
he	OO
wins	,O
he	OO
doesn't	OO
do	OO
so	OO
by	OO
really	OO
significantly	OO
outrunning	OO
his	OO
competition	.O
he's	OU
running	OO
at	OO
most	OO
a	OO
percent	OO
faster	OO
than	OO
the	OO
one	OO
who	OO
loses	OO
the	OO
race	.O
and	OU
not	OO
only	OO
does	OO
he	OO
run	OO
only	OO
one	OO
percent	OO
faster	OO
than	OO
the	OO
second	OO
one	,O
but	OO
he	OO
doesn't	OO
run	OO
10	OO
times	OO
faster	OO
than	OO
i	OU
do	OO
—	OO
and	OO
i'm	OU
not	OO
a	OO
good	OO
runner	,O
trust	OO
me	OO
on	OO
that	.O
and	OU
every	OO
time	OO
we	OO
are	OO
able	OO
to	OO
measure	OO
performance	,O
we	OO
notice	OO
something	OO
very	OO
interesting;	OO
that	OO
is	,O
performance	OO
is	OO
bounded	.O
what	OU
it	OO
means	OO
is	OO
that	OO
there	OO
are	OO
no	OO
huge	OO
variations	OO
in	OO
human	OO
performance	.O
it	OU
varies	OO
only	OO
in	OO
a	OO
narrow	OO
range	,O
and	OO
we	OO
do	OO
need	OO
the	OO
chronometer	OO
to	OO
measure	OO
the	OO
differences	.O
this	OU
is	OO
not	OO
to	OO
say	OO
that	OO
we	OO
cannot	OO
see	OO
the	OO
good	OO
from	OO
the	OO
best	OO
ones	,O
but	OO
the	OO
best	OO
ones	OO
are	OO
very	OO
hard	OO
to	OO
distinguish	.O
and	OU
the	OO
problem	OO
with	OO
that	OO
is	OO
that	OO
most	OO
of	OO
us	OO
work	OO
in	OO
areas	OO
where	OO
we	OO
do	OO
not	OO
have	OO
a	OO
chronometer	OO
to	OO
gauge	OO
our	OO
performance	.O
alright	,U
performance	OO
is	OO
bounded	,O
there	OO
are	OO
no	OO
huge	OO
differences	OO
between	OO
us	OO
when	OO
it	OO
comes	OO
to	OO
our	OO
performance	.O
how	OU
about	OO
success	?O
well	,U
let's	OO
switch	OO
to	OO
a	OO
different	OO
topic	,O
like	OO
books	.O
one	OU
measure	OO
of	OO
success	OO
for	OO
writers	OO
is	OO
how	OO
many	OO
people	OO
read	OO
your	OO
work	.O
and	OU
so	OO
when	OO
my	OO
previous	OO
book	OO
came	OO
out	OO
in	OO
2009	,O
i	OU
was	OO
in	OO
europe	OU
talking	OO
with	OO
my	OO
editor	,O
and	OO
i	OU
was	OO
interested:	OO
who	OU
is	OO
the	OO
competition	?O
and	OU
i	OU
had	OO
some	OO
fabulous	OO
ones	.O
that	OU
week	OO
—	OO
dan	OU
brown	OU
came	OO
out	OO
with	OO
the	OU
lost	OU

and	OO
the	OU

also	OO
came	OO
out	,O
nicholas	OU

and	OU
when	OO
you	OO
just	OO
look	OO
at	OO
the	OO

you	OO
realize	,O
you	OO
know	,O
performance	OO
wise	,O
there's	OO
hardly	OO
any	OO
difference	OO
between	OO
these	OO
books	OO
or	OO
mine	.O
right	?U
so	OU
maybe	OO
if	OO
nicholas	OU
sparks's	OU
team	OO
works	OO
a	OO
little	OO
harder	,O
he	OO
could	OO
easily	OO
be	OO
number	OO
one	,O
because	OO
it's	OO
almost	OO
by	OO
accident	OO
who	OO
ended	OO
up	OO
at	OO
the	OO
top	.O
so	OU
i	OU
said	,O
let's	OO
look	OO
at	OO
the	OO
numbers	OO
—	OO
i'm	OU
a	OO
data	OO
person	,O
right	?O
so	OU
let's	OO
see	OO
what	OO
were	OO
the	OO
sales	OO
for	OO
nicholas	OU
sparks	.U
and	OU
it	OO
turns	OO
out	OO
that	OO
that	OO
opening	OO
weekend	,O
nicholas	OU
sparks	OU
sold	OO
more	OO
than	OO
a	OO
hundred	OO
thousand	OO
copies	,O
which	OO
is	OO
an	OO
amazing	OO
number	.O
you	OU
can	OO
actually	OO
get	OO
to	OO
the	OO
top	OO
of	OO
the	OO
new	OU
york	OU
times	OU
best	OO
seller	OO
list	OO
by	OO
selling	OO
10,000	OO
copies	OO
a	OO
week	,O
so	OO
he	OO
tenfold	OO
overcame	OO
what	OO
he	OO
needed	OO
to	OO
be	OO
number	OO
one	.O
yet	OU
he	OO
wasn't	OO
number	OO
one	.O
why	?U
because	OU
there	OO
was	OO
dan	OU
brown	,U
who	OO
sold	OO
1.2	OO
million	OO
copies	OO
that	OO
weekend	.O
and	OU
the	OO
reason	OO
i	OU
like	OO
this	OO
number	OO
is	OO
because	OO
it	OO
shows	OO
that	,O
really	,O
when	OO
it	OO
comes	OO
to	OO
success	,O
it's	OO
unbounded	,O
that	OO
the	OO
best	OO
doesn't	OO
only	OO
get	OO
slightly	OO
more	OO
than	OO
the	OO
second	OO
best	OO
but	OO
gets	OO
orders	OO
of	OO
magnitude	OO
more	,O
because	OO
success	OO
is	OO
a	OO
collective	OO
measure	.O
we	OU
give	OO
it	OO
to	OO
them	,O
rather	OO
than	OO
we	OO
earn	OO
it	OO
through	OO
our	OO
performance	.O
so	OU
one	OO
of	OO
things	OO
we	OO
realized	OO
is	OO
that	OO
performance	,O
what	OO
we	OO
do	,O
is	OO
bounded	,O
but	OO
success	,O
which	OO
is	OO
collective	,O
is	OO
unbounded	,O
which	OO
makes	OO
you	OO
wonder:	OO
how	OU
do	OO
you	OO
get	OO
these	OO
huge	OO
differences	OO
in	OO
success	OO
when	OO
you	OO
have	OO
such	OO
tiny	OO
differences	OO
in	OO
performance	?O
and	OU
recently	,O
i	OU
published	OO
a	OO
book	OO
that	OO
i	OU
devoted	OO
to	OO
that	OO
very	OO
question	.O
and	OU
they	OO
didn't	OO
give	OO
me	OO
enough	OO
time	OO
to	OO
go	OO
over	OO
all	OO
of	OO
that	,O
so	OO
i'm	OU
going	OO
to	OO
go	OO
back	OO
to	OO
the	OO
question	OO
of	,O
alright	,O
you	OO
have	OO
success;	OO
when	OO
should	OO
that	OO
appear	?O
so	OU
let's	OO
go	OO
back	OO
to	OO
the	OO
party	OO
spoiler	OO
and	OO
ask	OO
ourselves:	OO
why	OU
did	OO
einstein	OU
make	OO
this	OO
ridiculous	OO
statement	,O
that	OO
only	OO
before	OO
30	OO
you	OO
could	OO
actually	OO
be	OO
creative	?O
well	,U
because	OO
he	OO
looked	OO
around	OO
himself	OO
and	OO
he	OO
saw	OO
all	OO
these	OO
fabulous	OO
physicists	OO
that	OO
created	OO
quantum	OO
mechanics	OO
and	OO
modern	OO
physics	,O
and	OO
they	OO
were	OO
all	OO
in	OO
their	OO
20s	OO
and	OO
early	OO
30s	OO
when	OO
they	OO
did	OO
so	.O
and	OU
it's	OO
not	OO
only	OO
him	.O
it's	OU
not	OO
only	OO
observational	OO
bias	,O
because	OO
there's	OO
actually	OO
a	OO
whole	OO
field	OO
of	OO
genius	OO
research	OO
that	OO
has	OO
documented	OO
the	OO
fact	OO
that	,O
if	OO
we	OO
look	OO
at	OO
the	OO
people	OO
we	OO
admire	OO
from	OO
the	OO
past	OO
and	OO
then	OO
look	OO
at	OO
what	OO
age	OO
they	OO
made	OO
their	OO
biggest	OO
contribution	,O
whether	OO
that's	OO
music	,O
whether	OO
that's	OO
science	,O
whether	OO
that's	OO
engineering	,O
most	OO
of	OO
them	OO
tend	OO
to	OO
do	OO
so	OO
in	OO
their	OO
20s	,O
30s	,O
early	OO
40s	OO
at	OO
most	.O
but	OU
there's	OO
a	OO
problem	OO
with	OO
this	OO
genius	OO
research	.O
well	,U
first	OO
of	OO
all	,O
it	OO
created	OO
the	OO
impression	OO
to	OO
us	OO
that	OO
creativity	OO
equals	OO
youth	,O
which	OO
is	OO
painful	,O
right	?O
and	OU
it	OO
also	OO
has	OO
an	OO
observational	OO
bias	,O
because	OO
it	OO
only	OO
looks	OO
at	OO
geniuses	OO
and	OO
doesn't	OO
look	OO
at	OO
ordinary	OO
scientists	OO
and	OO
doesn't	OO
look	OO
at	OO
all	OO
of	OO
us	OO
and	OO
ask	,O
is	OO
it	OO
really	OO
true	OO
that	OO
creativity	OO
vanishes	OO
as	OO
we	OO
age	?O
so	OU
that's	OO
exactly	OO
what	OO
we	OO
tried	OO
to	OO
do	,O
and	OO
this	OO
is	OO
important	OO
for	OO
that	OO
to	OO
actually	OO
have	OO
references	.O
so	OU
let's	OO
look	OO
at	OO
an	OO
ordinary	OO
scientist	OO
like	OO
myself	,O
and	OO
let's	OO
look	OO
at	OO
my	OO
career	.O
so	OU
what	OO
you	OO
see	OO
here	OO
is	OO
all	OO
the	OO
papers	OO
that	OO
i've	OU
published	OO
from	OO
my	OO
very	OO
first	OO
paper	,O
in	OO
1989;	OO
i	OU
was	OO
still	OO
in	OO
romania	OU
when	OO
i	OU
did	OO
so	,O
till	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
this	OO
year	.O
and	OU
vertically	,O
you	OO
see	OO
the	OO
impact	OO
of	OO
the	OO
paper	,O
that	OO
is	,O
how	OO
many	OO
citations	,O
how	OO
many	OO
other	OO
papers	OO
have	OO
been	OO
written	OO
that	OO
cited	OO
that	OO
work	.O
and	OU
when	OO
you	OO
look	OO
at	OO
that	,O
you	OO
see	OO
that	OO
my	OO
career	OO
has	OO
roughly	OO
three	OO
different	OO
stages	.O
i	OU
had	OO
the	OO
first	OO
10	OO
years	OO
where	OO
i	OU
had	OO
to	OO
work	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
and	OO
i	OU
don't	OO
achieve	OO
much	.O
no	OU
one	OO
seems	OO
to	OO
care	OO
about	OO
what	OO
i	OU
do	,O
right	?O
there's	OU
hardly	OO
any	OO
impact	.O
that	OU
time	,O
i	OU
was	OO
doing	OO
material	OO
science	,O
and	OO
then	OO
i	OU
kind	OO
of	OO
discovered	OO
for	OO
myself	OO
networks	OO
and	OO
then	OO
started	OO
publishing	OO
in	OO
networks	.O
and	OU
that	OO
led	OO
from	OO
one	OO
high	OO
impact	OO
paper	OO
to	OO
the	OO
other	OO
one	.O
and	OU
it	OO
really	OO
felt	OO
good	.O
that	OU
was	OO
that	OO
stage	OO
of	OO
my	OO
career	.O
so	OU
the	OO
question	OO
is	,O
what	OO
happens	OO
right	OO
now	?O
and	OU
we	OO
don't	OO
know	,O
because	OO
there	OO
hasn't	OO
been	OO
enough	OO
time	OO
passed	OO
yet	OO
to	OO
actually	OO
figure	OO
out	OO
how	OO
much	OO
impact	OO
those	OO
papers	OO
will	OO
get;	OO
it	OO
takes	OO
time	OO
to	OO
acquire	.O
well	,U
when	OO
you	OO
look	OO
at	OO
the	OO
data	,O
it	OO
seems	OO
to	OO
be	OO
that	OO
einstein	,U
the	OO
genius	OO
research	,O
is	OO
right	,O
and	OO
i'm	OU
at	OO
that	OO
stage	OO
of	OO
my	OO
career	.O
so	OU
we	OO
said	,O
ok	,U
let's	OO
figure	OO
out	OO
how	OO
does	OO
this	OO
really	OO
happen	,O
first	OO
in	OO
science	.O
and	OU
in	OO
order	OO
not	OO
to	OO
have	OO
the	OO
selection	OO
bias	,O
to	OO
look	OO
only	OO
at	OO
geniuses	,O
we	OO
ended	OO
up	OO
reconstructing	OO
the	OO
career	OO
of	OO
every	OO
single	OO
scientist	OO
from	OO
1900	OO
till	OO
today	OO
and	OO
finding	OO
for	OO
all	OO
scientists	OO
what	OO
was	OO
their	OO
personal	OO
best	,O
whether	OO
they	OO
got	OO
the	OO
nobel	OU
prize	OU
or	OO
they	OO
never	OO
did	,O
or	OO
no	OO
one	OO
knows	OO
what	OO
they	OO
did	,O
even	OO
their	OO
personal	OO
best	.O
and	OU
that's	OO
what	OO
you	OO
see	OO
in	OO
this	OO
slide	.O
each	OU
line	OO
is	OO
a	OO
career	,O
and	OO
when	OO
you	OO
have	OO
a	OO
light	OO
blue	OO
dot	OO
on	OO
the	OO
top	OO
of	OO
that	OO
career	,O
it	OO
says	OO
that	OO
was	OO
their	OO
personal	OO
best	.O
and	OU
the	OO
question	OO
is	,O
when	OO
did	OO
they	OO
actually	OO
make	OO
their	OO
biggest	OO
discovery	?O
to	OU
quantify	OO
that	,O
we	OO
look	OO
at	OO
what's	OO
the	OO
probability	OO
that	OO
you	OO
make	OO
your	OO
biggest	OO
discovery	,O
let's	OO
say	,O
one	,O
two	,O
three	OO
or	OO
10	OO
years	OO
into	OO
your	OO
career	?O
we're	OU
not	OO
looking	OO
at	OO
real	OO
age	.O
we're	OU
looking	OO
at	OO
what	OO
we	OO
call	OO
academic	OO
age	.O
your	OU
academic	OO
age	OO
starts	OO
when	OO
you	OO
publish	OO
your	OO
first	OO
papers	.O
i	OU
know	OO
some	OO
of	OO
you	OO
are	OO
still	OO
babies	.O
so	OU
let's	OO
look	OO
at	OO
the	OO
probability	OO
that	OO
you	OO
publish	OO
your	OO
highest	OO
impact	OO
paper	.O
and	OU
what	OO
you	OO
see	OO
is	,O
indeed	,O
the	OO
genius	OO
research	OO
is	OO
right	.O
most	OU
scientists	OO
tend	OO
to	OO
publish	OO
their	OO
highest	OO
impact	OO
paper	OO
in	OO
the	OO
first	OO
10	,O
15	OO
years	OO
in	OO
their	OO
career	,O
and	OO
it	OO
tanks	OO
after	OO
that	.O
it	OU
tanks	OO
so	OO
fast	OO
that	OO
i'm	OU
about	OO
—	OO
i'm	OU
exactly	OO
30	OO
years	OO
into	OO
my	OO
career	,O
and	OO
the	OO
chance	OO
that	OO
i	OU
will	OO
publish	OO
a	OO
paper	OO
that	OO
would	OO
have	OO
a	OO
higher	OO
impact	OO
than	OO
anything	OO
that	OO
i	OU
did	OO
before	OO
is	OO
less	OO
than	OO
one	OO
percent	.O
i	OU
am	OO
in	OO
that	OO
stage	OO
of	OO
my	OO
career	,O
according	OO
to	OO
this	OO
data	.O
but	OU
there's	OO
a	OO
problem	OO
with	OO
that	.O
we're	OU
not	OO
doing	OO
controls	OO
properly	.O
so	OU
the	OO
control	OO
would	OO
be	,O
what	OO
would	OO
a	OO
scientist	OO
look	OO
like	OO
who	OO
makes	OO
random	OO
contribution	OO
to	OO
science	?O
or	OU
what	OO
is	OO
the	OO
productivity	OO
of	OO
the	OO
scientist	?O
when	OU
do	OO
they	OO
write	OO
papers	?O
so	OU
we	OO
measured	OO
the	OO
productivity	,O
and	OO
amazingly	,O
the	OO
productivity	,O
your	OO
likelihood	OO
of	OO
writing	OO
a	OO
paper	OO
in	OO
year	OO
one	,O
10	OO
or	OO
20	OO
in	OO
your	OO
career	,O
is	OO
indistinguishable	OO
from	OO
the	OO
likelihood	OO
of	OO
having	OO
the	OO
impact	OO
in	OO
that	OO
part	OO
of	OO
your	OO
career	.O
and	OU
to	OO
make	OO
a	OO
long	OO
story	OO
short	,O
after	OO
lots	OO
of	OO
statistical	OO
tests	,O
there's	OO
only	OO
one	OO
explanation	OO
for	OO
that	,O
that	OO
really	,O
the	OO
way	OO
we	OO
scientists	OO
work	OO
is	OO
that	OO
every	OO
single	OO
paper	OO
we	OO
write	,O
every	OO
project	OO
we	OO
do	,O
has	OO
exactly	OO
the	OO
same	OO
chance	OO
of	OO
being	OO
our	OO
personal	OO
best	.O
that	OU
is	,O
discovery	OO
is	OO
like	OO
a	OO
lottery	OO
ticket	.O
and	OU
the	OO
more	OO
lottery	OO
tickets	OO
we	OO
buy	,O
the	OO
higher	OO
our	OO
chances	.O
and	OU
it	OO
happens	OO
to	OO
be	OO
so	OO
that	OO
most	OO
scientists	OO
buy	OO
most	OO
of	OO
their	OO
lottery	OO
tickets	OO
in	OO
the	OO
first	OO
10	,O
15	OO
years	OO
of	OO
their	OO
career	,O
and	OO
after	OO
that	,O
their	OO
productivity	OO
decreases	.O
they're	OU
not	OO
buying	OO
any	OO
more	OO
lottery	OO
tickets	.O
so	OU
it	OO
looks	OO
as	OO
if	OO
they	OO
would	OO
not	OO
be	OO
creative	.O
in	OU
reality	,O
they	OO
stopped	OO
trying	.O
so	OU
when	OO
we	OO
actually	OO
put	OO
the	OO
data	OO
together	,O
the	OO
conclusion	OO
is	OO
very	OO
simple:	OO
success	OO
can	OO
come	OO
at	OO
any	OO
time	.O
it	OU
could	OO
be	OO
your	OO
very	OO
first	OO
or	OO
very	OO
last	OO
paper	OO
of	OO
your	OO
career	.O
it's	OU
totally	OO
random	OO
in	OO
the	OO
space	OO
of	OO
the	OO
projects	.O
it	OU
is	OO
the	OO
productivity	OO
that	OO
changes	.O
let	OU
me	OO
illustrate	OO
that	.O
here	OU
is	OO
frank	OU
wilczek	,U
who	OO
got	OO
the	OO
nobel	OU
prize	OU
in	OO
physics	OU
for	OO
the	OO
very	OO
first	OO
paper	OO
he	OO
ever	OO
wrote	OO
in	OO
his	OO
career	OO
as	OO
a	OO
graduate	OO
student	.O
more	OU
interesting	OO
is	OO
john	OU
fenn	,U
who	,O
at	OO
age	OO
70	,O
was	OO
forcefully	OO
retired	OO
by	OO
yale	OU
university	.U
they	OU
shut	OO
his	OO
lab	OO
down	,O
and	OO
at	OO
that	OO
moment	,O
he	OO
moved	OO
to	OO
virginia	OU
commonwealth	OU
university	,U
opened	OO
another	OO
lab	,O
and	OO
it	OO
is	OO
there	,O
at	OO
age	OO
72	,O
that	OO
he	OO
published	OO
a	OO
paper	OO
for	OO
which	,O
15	OO
years	OO
later	,O
he	OO
got	OO
the	OO
nobel	OU
prize	OU
for	OO
chemistry	.U
and	OU
you	OO
think	,O
ok	,U
well	,O
science	OO
is	OO
special	,O
but	OO
what	OO
about	OO
other	OO
areas	OO
where	OO
we	OO
need	OO
to	OO
be	OO
creative	?O
so	OU
let	OO
me	OO
take	OO
another	OO
typical	OO
example:	OO
entrepreneurship	.O
silicon	OU
valley	,U
the	OO
land	OO
of	OO
the	OO
youth	,O
right	?O
and	OU
indeed	,O
when	OO
you	OO
look	OO
at	OO
it	,O
you	OO
realize	OO
that	OO
the	OO
biggest	OO
awards	,O
the	OO
techcrunch	OU
awards	OU
and	OO
other	OO
awards	,O
are	OO
all	OO
going	OO
to	OO
people	OO
whose	OO
average	OO
age	OO
is	OO
late	OO
20s	,O
very	OO
early	OO
30s	.O
you	OU
look	OO
at	OO
who	OO
the	OO
vcs	OU
give	OO
the	OO
money	OO
to	,O
some	OO
of	OO
the	OO
biggest	OO
vc	OU
firms	OO
—	OO
all	OO
people	OO
in	OO
their	OO
early	OO
30s	.O
which	,U
of	OO
course	,O
we	OO
know;	OO
there	OO
is	OO
this	OO
ethos	OO
in	OO
silicon	OU
valley	OU
that	OO
youth	OO
equals	OO
success	.O
not	OU
when	OO
you	OO
look	OO
at	OO
the	OO
data	,O
because	OO
it's	OO
not	OO
only	OO
about	OO
forming	OO
a	OO
company	OO
—	OO
forming	OO
a	OO
company	OO
is	OO
like	OO
productivity	,O
trying	,O
trying	,O
trying	OO
—	OO
when	OO
you	OO
look	OO
at	OO
which	OO
of	OO
these	OO
individuals	OO
actually	OO
put	OO
out	OO
a	OO
successful	OO
company	,O
a	OO
successful	OO
exit	.O
and	OU
recently	,O
some	OO
of	OO
our	OO
colleagues	OO
looked	OO
at	OO
exactly	OO
that	OO
question	.O
and	OU
it	OO
turns	OO
out	OO
that	OO
yes	,O
those	OO
in	OO
the	OO
20s	OO
and	OO
30s	OO
put	OO
out	OO
a	OO
huge	OO
number	OO
of	OO
companies	,O
form	OO
lots	OO
of	OO
companies	,O
but	OO
most	OO
of	OO
them	OO
go	OO
bust	.O
and	OU
when	OO
you	OO
look	OO
at	OO
the	OO
successful	OO
exits	,O
what	OO
you	OO
see	OO
in	OO
this	OO
particular	OO
plot	,O
the	OO
older	OO
you	OO
are	,O
the	OO
more	OO
likely	OO
that	OO
you	OO
will	OO
actually	OO
hit	OO
the	OO

or	OO
the	OO
sell	OO
the	OO
company	OO
successfully	.O
this	OU
is	OO
so	OO
strong	,O
actually	,O
that	OO
if	OO
you	OO
are	OO
in	OO
the	OO
50s	,O
you	OO
are	OO
twice	OO
as	OO
likely	OO
to	OO
actually	OO
have	OO
a	OO
successful	OO

than	OO
if	OO
you	OO
are	OO
in	OO

so	OU
in	OO
the	OO
end	,O
what	OO
is	OO
it	OO
that	OO
we	OO

actually	?O
what	OU
we	OO
see	OO
is	OO
that	OO
creativity	OO

no	OO

right	?O
which	OU

telling	OO

that	OO
at	OO
the	OO

if	OO

—	OO
you	OO
could	OO
still	OO
succeed	OO

succeed	OO
over	OO

over	.O
so	OU
my	OO
conclusion	OO
is	OO
very	OO
simple:	OO
i	OU
am	OO
off	OO
the	OO

back	OO
in	OO
my	OO

you	.O
on	OU
the	OO
17th	OO
of	OO
october	,U
2009	,O
president	OU
mohamed	OU
nasheed	OU
of	OO
the	OO
maldives	OU
did	OO
something	OO
unusual	.O
he	OU
held	OO
his	OO
cabinet	OO
meeting	OO
underwater	.O
he	OU
literally	OO
took	OO
his	OO
ministers	OO
scuba	OO
diving	,O
as	OO
it	OO
were	,O
to	OO
warn	OO
the	OO
world	OO
that	OO
his	OO

could	OO
drown	OO
unless	OO
we	OO
control	OO

now	OU
i	OU
don't	OO
know	OO
whether	OO

he	OO
certainly	OO
caught	OO

i	OU

you	OU

i'm	OU
a	OO

and	OO
i	OU
notice	OO
these	OO

and	OU
let's	OO
be	OO
honest	,O
the	OO
maldives	OU

distant	OO
from	OO
where	OO
i	OU
come	OO
from	OO
—	OO
my	OO

so	OO
i	OU
didn't	OO
lose	OO
any	OO

over	OO
their	OO

fate	.O
barely	OU
two	OO
months	OO

i	OU
saw	OO
another	OO

this	OU
time	,O
the	OO
prime	OO

of	OO
nepal	,U
he	OO
held	OO
his	OO

all	OO
the	OO
way	OO
up	OO
to	OO
the	OO
base	OO
camp	OO
of	OO

to	OO
warn	OO
the	OO
world	OO
that	OO
the	OO
himalayan	OU

were	OO

now	OU
did	OO
that	OO
worry	OO
me	?O
you	OU
bet	OO
it	OO
did	.O
i	OU
live	OO
in	OO
the	OO

did	OO
i	OU

any	OO

over	OO

no	.U
i	OU
wasn't	OO

now	OU
fast	OO
forward	OO
10	OO
years	.O
in	OU
february	OU
this	OO

i	OU
saw	OO
this	OO
report	.O
this	OU
here	OO
report	OO
basically	OO
concludes	OO
that	OO
one	OO
third	OO
of	OO
the	OO
ice	OO
on	OO
the	OO
hindu	OU
kush	OU
himalaya	OU
mountains	OO
could	OO
melt	OO
by	OO
the	OO
end	OO
of	OO
the	OO

but	OU
that's	OO
only	OO
if	,O
if	OO
we	OO

able	OO
to	OO
contain	OO
global	OO

to	OO
1.5	OO
degrees	OO

over	OO
preindustrial	OO
levels	.O
otherwise	,U
if	OO
we	OO
can't	,O
the	OO
glaciers	OO
would	OO
melt	OO
much	OO
faster	.O
1.5	OO
degrees	OO
celsius	.U
no	OU
way	,O
i	OU
thought	.O
even	OU
the	OO

1.5	OO

is	OO
what	OO
they	OO
call	OO
the	OO
best	OO
case	OO
scenario	.O
now	OU
this	OO
can't	OO
be	OO
true	,O
i	OU
thought	.O
the	OU
hindu	OU

the	OO

third	OO
largest	OO
repository	OO
of	OO
ice	,O
after	OO
the	OO
north	OU

that's	OU
why	OO
we	OO
are	OO
also	OO
called	OO
the	OO

there's	OU
a	OO

of	OO

in	OO
the	OO

and	OU
yes	,O
the	OO
glaciers	,O
they	OO
are	OO

we	OU

that	.O
i	OU
have	OO
been	OO
to	OO

in	OO
my	OO

i've	OU
seen	OO
them	,O
and	OO
yes	,O
they	OO
are	OO
melting	.O
they	OU
are	OO
vulnerable	.O
but	OU
they	OO
can't	OO
be	OO
that	OO
vulnerable	,O
i	OU
remember	OO
thinking	.O
but	OU
what	OO
if	OO
they	OO
are	?O
what	OU
if	OO
our	OO

melt	OO
much	OO
more	OO
quickly	OO
than	OO
i	OU
anticipate	?O
what	OU
if	OO
our	OO

are	OO
much	OO
more	OO

than	OO
previously	OO

and	OU
what	OO

as	OO
a	OO
result	,O
the	OO
glacial	OO
lakes	OO
—	OO
now	OO
these	OO
are	OO
lakes	OO
that	OO

when	OO

what	OO

those	OO

burst	OO
under	OO
the	OO

and	OU
what	OO
if	OO
those	OO
floods	OO
cascade	OO
into	OO
other	OO
glacial	OO
lakes	,O
creating	OO
even	OO
bigger	OO

that	OU
would	OO
create	OO
unprecedented	OO
flash	OO

in	OO
my	OO
country	.O
that	OU
would	OO
wreck	OO
my	OO
country	.O
that	OU
would	OO
wreak	OO
havoc	OO
in	OO
my	OO

that	OU

potential	OO
to	OO
literally	OO
destroy	OO
our	OO

our	OO

our	OO

so	OU
that	OO

caught	OO
my	OO
attention	OO
in	OO
ways	OO
that	OO

it	OU

scientists	OU

our	OO

their	OO

kept	OO
me	OO

at	OO

agonizing	OO
about	OO
the	OO
bad	OO
news	OO
and	OO
what	OO
it	OO
meant	OO
for	OO
my	OO

my	OO

so	OU
after	OO
several	OO

nights	,O
i	OU
went	OO
to	OO
nepal	OU
to	OO
visit	OO
icimod	.U
i	OU
found	OO
a	OO
team	OO
of	OO
highly	OO
competent	OO
and	OO
dedicated	OO
scientists	OO
there	,O
and	OO
here's	OO
what	OO
they	OO
told	OO
me	.O
number	OU
one:	OO
the	OO
hindu	OU
kush	OU
himalaya	OU
glaciers	OO
have	OO
been	OO
melting	OO
for	OO
some	OO
time	OO
now	.O
take	OU
that	OO
glacier	,O
for	OO

it's	OU
on	OO
mount	OU
everest	.U
as	OU
you	OO
can	OO
see	,O
this	OO
once	OO
massive	OO
glacier	OO
has	OO
already	OO
lost	OO
much	OO
of	OO
its	OO
ice	.O
number	OU
two:	OO
the	OO
glaciers	OO
are	OO
now	OO
melting	OO
much	OO
more	OO
quickly	OO
—	OO
so	OO
quickly	,O
in	OO
fact	,O
that	OO
at	OO
just	OO
1.5	OO
degrees	OO
centigrade	OO
of	OO
global	OO
warming	,O
one	OO
third	OO
of	OO
the	OO
glaciers	OO
would	OO
melt	.O
at	OU
two	OO
degrees	OO
centigrade	OO
of	OO
global	OO
warming	,O
half	OO
the	OO
glaciers	OO
would	OO
disappear	.O
and	OU
if	OO
current	OO
trends	OO
were	OO
to	OO
continue	,O
a	OO
full	OO
two	OO
thirds	OO
of	OO
our	OO
glaciers	OO
would	OO
vanish	.O
number	OU
three:	OO
global	OO
warming	OO
means	OO
that	OO
our	OO
mountains	OO
receive	OO
more	OO
rain	OO
and	OO
less	OO
snow	.O
and	,O
unlike	OO
snowfall	,O
rain	OO
melts	OO
ice	,O
which	OO
just	OO
hurts	OO
the	OO
health	OO
of	OO
our	OO
glaciers	.O
number	OU
four:	OO
pollution	OO
in	OO
the	OO
region	OO
has	OO
increased	OO
the	OO
amount	OO
of	OO
black	OO
carbon	OO
that's	OO
deposited	OO
on	OO
our	OO
glaciers	.O
black	OU
carbon	OO
is	OO
like	OO
soot	.O
black	OU
carbon	OO
absorbs	OO
heat	OO
and	OO
just	OO
accelerates	OO
the	OO
melting	OO
of	OO
glaciers	.O
to	OU
summarize	,O
our	OO
glaciers	OO
are	OO
melting	OO
rapidly	,O
and	OO
global	OO
warming	OO
is	OO
making	OO
them	OO
melt	OO
much	OO
more	OO
quickly	.O
but	OU
what	OO
does	OO
this	OO
mean	?O
it	OU
means	OO
that	OO
the	OO
240	OO
million	OO
people	OO
who	OO
live	OO
in	OO
the	OO
hindu	OU
kush	OU
himalaya	OU

in	OO

myanmar	OU
and	OO
my	OO

beloved	OO
country	,O
bhutan	OU
—	OO
these	OO
people	OO
will	OO
be	OO
directly	OO
affected	.O
when	OU
glaciers	OO
melt	,O
when	OO
there's	OO
more	OO
rain	OO
and	OO
less	OO
snow	,O
there	OO
will	OO
be	OO
huge	OO
changes	OO
in	OO
the	OO
way	OO

there	OU
will	OO
be	OO
more	OO
extremes:	OO
more	OO
intense	OO
rain	,O
more	OO
flash	OO
floods	,O
more	OO
landslides	,O
more	OO
glacial	OO
lake	OO
outburst	OO
floods	.O
all	OU
this	OO
will	OO
cause	OO
unimaginable	OO
destruction	OO
in	OO
a	OO
region	OO
that	OO
already	OO
has	OO
some	OO
of	OO
the	OO
poorest	OO
people	OO
on	OO
earth	.O
but	OU
it's	OO
not	OO
just	OO
the	OO
people	OO
in	OO
the	OO
immediate	OO
region	OO
who'll	OO
be	OO
affected	.O
people	OU
living	OO
downstream	OO
will	OO
also	OO
be	OO
hit	OO
hard	.O
that's	OU
because	OO
10	OO
of	OO
their	OO
major	OO
rivers	OO
originate	OO
in	OO
the	OO
hindu	OU
kush	OU
himalaya	OU
mountains	.O
these	OU
rivers	OO
provide	OO
critical	OO
water	OO
for	OO
agriculture	OO
and	OO
drinking	OO
water	OO
to	OO
more	OO
than	OO
1.6	OO
billion	OO
people	OO
living	OO
downstream	.O
that's	OU
one	OO
in	OO
five	OO
humans	.O
that's	OU
why	OO
the	OO
hindu	OU
kush	OU
himalaya	OU
mountains	OO
are	OO
also	OO
called	OO
the	OO
water	OO
towers	OO
of	OO
asia	.U
but	OU
when	OO
glaciers	OO
melt	,O
when	OO
monsoons	OO
turn	OO
severe	,O
those	OO
rivers	OO
will	OO
obviously	OO
flood	,O
so	OO
there	OO
will	OO
be	OO
deluges	OO
when	OO
water	OO
is	OO
not	OO
required	OO
and	OO
droughts	OO
will	OO
be	OO
very	OO
common	,O
when	OO
water	OO
is	OO
desperately	OO
required	.O
in	OU
short	,O
asia's	OU
water	OO
tower	OO
will	OO
be	OO
broken	,O
and	OO
that	OO
will	OO
be	OO
disastrous	OO
for	OO
one	OO
fifth	OO
of	OO
humanity	.O
should	OU
the	OO
rest	OO
of	OO
the	OO
world	OO
care	?O
should	OU
you	,O
for	OO

care	?O
remember	,U
i	OU
didn't	OO
care	OO
when	OO
i	OU
heard	OO
that	OO
the	OO
maldives	OU
could	OO
disappear	OO
underwater	.O
and	OU
that	OO
is	OO
the	OO
crux	OO
of	OO
the	OO
problem	,O
isn't	OO
it	?O
we	OU
don't	OO
care	.O
we	OU
don't	OO
care	OO
until	OO
we	OO
are	OO
personally	OO
affected	.O
i	OU
mean	,O
we	OO
know	.O
we	OU
know	OO
climate	OO
change	OO
is	OO
real	.O
we	OU
know	OO
that	OO
we	OO
face	OO
drastic	OO
and	OO
dramatic	OO
change	.O
we	OU
know	OO
that	OO
it	OO
is	OO
coming	OO
fast	.O
yet	OU
most	OO
of	OO
us	OO
act	OO
as	OO
if	OO
everything	OO
were	OO
normal	.O
so	OU
we	OO
must	OO
care	,O
all	OO
of	OO
us	,O
and	OO
if	OO
you	OO
can't	OO
care	OO
for	OO
those	OO
who	OO
are	OO
affected	OO
by	OO
the	OO
melting	OO
of	OO
glaciers	,O
you	OO
should	OO
at	OO
least	OO
care	OO
for	OO
yourself	.O
that's	OU
because	OO
the	OO
hindu	OU
kush	OU
himalaya	OU
mountains	OO
—	OO
the	OO
entire	OO

is	OO
like	OO
the	OO

if	OU
the	OO

falls	OO
sick	,O
the	OO
entire	OO

will	OO
eventually	OO
suffer	.O
and	OU
right	OO
now	,O
with	OO
our	OO
glaciers	OO

rapidly	,O
the	OO
region	OO
is	OO
not	OO
just	OO
sick	OO
—	OO
it	OO
is	OO
crying	OO
out	OO
for	OO
help	.O
and	OU
how	OO
will	OO
it	OO
affect	OO
the	OO
rest	OO
of	OO
the	OO
world	?O
one	OU
obvious	OO
scenario	OO
is	OO
the	OO
potential	OO
destabilization	OO
caused	OO
by	OO
tens	OO
of	OO
millions	OO
of	OO

refugees	,O
who'll	OO
be	OO

to	OO
move	OO
because	OO
they	OO

or	OO
because	OO
their	OO

have	OO
been	OO
destroyed	OO
by	OO
the	OO
melting	OO
of	OO

another	OU
scenario	OO
we	OO
can't	OO
take	OO
lightly	OO
is	OO
the	OO
potential	OO
of	OO
conflict	OO
over	OO

and	OO
the	OO
political	OO
destabilization	OO
in	OO
a	OO
region	OO
that	OO
has	OO
three	OO
nuclear	OO
powers:	OO
china	,U
india	,U
pakistan	.U
i	OU
believe	OO
that	OO
the	OO
situation	OO
in	OO
our	OO
region	OO
is	OO
grave	OO
enough	OO
to	OO
warrant	OO
the	OO
creation	OO
of	OO
a	OO

agency	.O
so	OU
as	OO
a	OO
native	OO
from	OO
that	OO
part	OO
of	OO
the	OO

i	OU
want	OO
to	OO

the	OO

third	OO

a	OU

something	OO

that	OO

this	OO

sure	,U
we	OO
all	OO

a	OO

of	OO

inside	OO

in	OO

we	OO

the	OO

by	OO
an	OO

that	OO

about	OO

our	OU

by	OO

i	OU
think	OO
the	OO
most	OO
powerful	OO
of	OO
them	OO
is	OO
the	OO
dominant	OO
political	OO
narrative	OO
of	OO
our	OO

which	OO
tells	OO
us	OO
that	OO
we	OO
should	OO
live	OO
in	OO
extreme	OO
individualism	OO
and	OO
competition	OO
with	OO
each	OO

it	OU

us	OO
to	OO

each	OO

each	OO

it	OU

that	OO

we	OU
are	OO
a	OO

we	OO

but	OU
it	OO
doesn't	OO
have	OO
to	OO
be	OO
like	OO
this	.O
it	OU
really	OO
doesn't	,O
because	OO
we	OO

this	OO
incredible	OO
capacity	OO
for	OO

where	OU
there	OO

we	OO

build	OO
a	OO

with	OO

where	OU

so	OO
that	OO

that	OO

at	OO
the	OO

if	OU
something	OO

it	OO

and	OU
i	OU
call	OO
all	OO
this	OO
the	OO
politics	OO
of	OO

now	,U
i	OU
think	OO
this	OO
has	OO
got	OO
the	OO
potential	OO
to	OO
appeal	OO
across	OO
quite	OO
a	OO
wide	OO
range	OO
of	OO
people	,O
and	OO
the	OO
reason	OO
for	OO
this	OO
is	OO
that	OO
among	OO
the	OO
very	OO
few	OO
values	OO
that	OO
both	OO
left	OO
and	OO
right	OO
share	OO
are	OO
belonging	OO
and	OO
community	.O
and	OU
we	OO
might	OO
mean	OO
slightly	OO
different	OO
things	OO
by	OO
them	,O
but	OO
at	OO
least	OO
we	OO
start	OO
with	OO
some	OO
language	OO
in	OO
common	.O
in	OU
fact	,O
you	OO
can	OO
see	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
politics	OO
as	OO
being	OO
a	OO
search	OO
for	OO
belonging	.O
even	OU
fascists	OO
seek	OO
community	,O
albeit	OO
a	OO
frighteningly	OO
homogenous	OO
community	OO
where	OO
everyone	OO
looks	OO
the	OO
same	OO
and	OO
wears	OO
the	OO
same	OO
uniform	OO
and	OO
chants	OO
the	OO
same	OO
slogans	.O
what	OU
we	OO
need	OO
to	OO
create	OO
is	OO
a	OO
community	OO
based	OO
on	OO
bridging	OO
networks	,O
not	OO
bonding	OO
networks	.O
now	OU
a	OO
bonding	OO
network	OO
brings	OO
together	OO
people	OO
from	OO
a	OO
homogenous	OO
group	,O
whereas	OO
a	OO
bridging	OO
network	OO
brings	OO
together	OO
people	OO
from	OO
different	OO
groups	.O
and	OU
my	OO
belief	OO
is	OO
that	OO
if	OO
we	OO
create	OO
sufficiently	OO
rich	OO
and	OO
vibrant	OO
bridging	OO
communities	,O
we	OO
can	OO
thwart	OO
the	OO
urge	OO
for	OO
people	OO
to	OO
burrow	OO
into	OO
the	OO
security	OO
of	OO
a	OO
homogenous	OO
bonding	OO
community	OO
defending	OO
themselves	OO
against	OO
the	OO
other	.O
so	OU
in	OO
summary	,O
our	OO
new	OO
story	OO
could	OO
go	OO
something	OO
like	OO
this	.O
disorder	OU
afflicts	OO
the	OO
land	.O
caused	OU
by	OO
the	OO
powerful	OO
and	OO
nefarious	OO
forces	OO
of	OO
people	OO
who	OO
say	OO
there's	OO
no	OO
such	OO
thing	OO
as	OO

who	OO
tell	OO
us	OO
that	OO
our	OO
highest	OO
purpose	OO
in	OO
life	OO
is	OO
to	OO
fight	OO
like	OO
stray	OO
dogs	OO
over	OO
a	OO
dustbin	.O
but	OU
the	OO
heroes	OO
of	OO
the	OO

us	,O
we'll	OO
revolt	OO
against	OO
this	OO
disorder	.O
we	OU
will	OO
fight	OO
those	OO
nefarious	OO
forces	OO
by	OO
building	OO
rich	,O
engaging	,O

and	,O
in	OO

so	,O
we	OO
will	OO
restore	OO

the	OO

now	OU
whether	OO

that	OO

the	OO

how	OO

that	OO

that	OO
the	OO

its	OO

it	OU
was	OO
the	OO
totality	OO
of	OO

one	OO
of	OO

to	OO
the	OO

that	OO

i	OU
don't	OO

this	OO

what	OO

that	OO

as	OO
the	OO
most	OO

measurement	OO
of	OO
a	OO

and	OU
my	OO
argument	OO
today	OO
is	OO
that	OO
it	OO
is	OO
time	OO
for	OO
that	OO
to	OO
change	.O
you	OU

what	OO
we	OO
choose	OO
to	OO
measure	OO
as	OO
a	OO
country	OO
matters	.O
it	OU
really	OO
matters	,O
because	OO
it	OO
drives	OO

it	OO
drives	OO
public	OO
activity	.O
and	OU
against	OO
that	OO
context	,O
i	OU
think	OO
the	OO
limitations	OO
of	OO
gdp	OU
as	OO
a	OO
measurement	OO
of	OO
a	OO
country's	OO
success	OO
are	OO
all	OO
too	OO
obvious	.O
you	OU
know	,O
gdp	OU
measures	OO
the	OO
output	OO
of	OO
all	OO
of	OO
our	OO
work	,O
but	OO
it	OO
says	OO
nothing	OO
about	OO
the	OO
nature	OO
of	OO
that	OO
work	,O
about	OO
whether	OO
that	OO
work	OO
is	OO
worthwhile	OO
or	OO
fulfilling	.O
it	OU
puts	OO
a	OO
value	,O
for	OO
example	,O
on	OO
illegal	OO
drug	OO
consumption	,O
but	OO
not	OO
on	OO
unpaid	OO
care	.O
it	OU
values	OO
activity	OO
in	OO
the	OO
short	OO
term	OO
that	OO
boosts	OO
the	OO
economy	,O
even	OO
if	OO
that	OO
activity	OO
is	OO
hugely	OO
damaging	OO
to	OO
the	OO
sustainability	OO
of	OO
our	OO
planet	OO
in	OO
the	OO
longer	OO
term	.O
and	OU
we	OO
reflect	OO
on	OO
the	OO
past	OO

of	OO

of	OO

when	OO

to	OO
the	OO

of	OO
the	OO
climate	OO

increasing	OO
automation	,O
an	OO

then	OO
i	OU
think	OO
the	OO
argument	OO
for	OO
the	OO
case	OO
for	OO
a	OO
much	OO
broader	OO
definition	OO
of	OO
what	OO
it	OO
means	OO
to	OO
be	OO
successful	OO
as	OO
a	OO
country	,O
as	OO
a	OO
society	,O
is	OO
compelling	,O
and	OO
increasingly	OO
so	.O
and	OU
that	OO
is	OO
why	OO
scotland	,U
in	OO
2018	,O
took	OO
the	OO

the	OO

the	OO

for	OO

we're	OU
sometimes	OO

it	OO

at	OO
any	OO
or	OO
all	OO

in	OU
fact	,O
the	OO

that	OO
the	OO

the	OO

a	OO

how	OO

a	OO

i	OU

in	OO
the	OO

we	OO

it	OO
has	OO
a	OO
deeper	OO
resonance	.O
you	OU
know	,O
when	OO
we	OO
focus	OO
on	OO
well	OO

we	OO
start	OO
a	OO

that	OO
provokes	OO
profound	OO
and	OO
fundamental	OO
questions	.O
what	OU
really	OO
matters	OO
to	OO
us	OO
in	OO
our	OO

what	OU
do	OO
we	OO

what	OU

of	OO

what	OO

that	OO

i've	OU
been	OO
a	OO
police	OO

in	OO
an	OO

city	OO
for	OO
nearly	OO
25	OO

that's	OU

right	?O

in	OO
that	OO

i've	OU
served	OO
in	OO
every	OO
rank	,O
from	OO
police	OO
officer	OO
to	OO
police	OO
chief	.O
a	OU
few	OO
years	OO

i	OU
noticed	OO
something	OO
alarming	.O
starting	OU
in	OO
2014	,O
i	OU
started	OO
monitoring	OO
recruits	OO
as	OO
they	OO
cycled	OO
through	OO
police	OO
academies	OO
in	OO
the	OO
state	OO
of	OO
new	OU
jersey	,U
and	OO
i	OU
found	OO
that	OO
women	OO
were	OO
failing	OO
at	OO
rates	OO
between	OO
65	OO
and	OO
80	OO
percent	,O
due	OO
to	OO
varying	OO
aspects	OO
of	OO
the	OO
physical	OO
fitness	OO
test	.O
i	OU
learned	OO
that	OO
a	OO
change	OO
in	OO
policy	OO
now	OO
required	OO
recruits	OO
to	OO
pass	OO
the	OO
fitness	OO
exam	OO
within	OO
10	OO
short	OO
workout	OO
sessions	.O
this	OU
had	OO
the	OO
greatest	OO
impact	OO
on	OO
women	.O
the	OU
change	OO
meant	OO
that	OO
recruits	OO
had	OO
about	OO
three	OO
weeks	OO
out	OO
of	OO
a	OO
five	OO
month	OO
long	OO
academy	OO
to	OO
pass	OO
the	OO
fitness	OO
exam	.O
this	OU
just	OO
didn't	OO
make	OO
sense	,O
though	.O
police	OU
agencies	OO
and	OO
police	OO
recruits	OO
had	OO
made	OO
huge	OO
investments	OO
to	OO
get	OO
those	OO
recruits	OO
into	OO
the	OO
academy	.O
police	OU
recruits	OO
had	OO
passed	OO
lengthy	OO
background	OO
checks	,O
they	OO
had	OO
passed	OO
medical	OO
and	OO
psychological	OO
exams	,O
they	OO
had	OO
quit	OO
their	OO
jobs	.O
and	OU
many	OO
had	OO
spent	OO
more	OO
than	OO
2,000	OO
dollars	OO
in	OO
fees	OO
and	OO
equipment	OO
just	OO
to	OO
get	OO
kicked	OO
out	OO
within	OO
the	OO
first	OO
three	OO
weeks	?O
the	OU
dire	OO
situation	OO
in	OO
new	OU

led	OO
me	OO
to	OO
examine	OO
the	OO
status	OO
of	OO
women	OO
in	OO
policing	OO
across	OO
the	OO
united	OU
states	.U
i	OU
found	OO
that	OO
women	OO
make	OO
up	OO
less	OO
than	OO
13	OO
percent	OO
of	OO
police	OO
officers	.O
a	OU
number	OO
that	OO
hasn't	OO
changed	OO
much	OO
in	OO
the	OO
past	OO
20	OO
years	.O
and	OU
they	OO
make	OO
up	OO
just	OO
three	OO
percent	OO
of	OO
police	OO
chiefs	OO
as	OO
of	OO
2013	,O
the	OO
last	OO
time	OO
the	OO
data	OO
was	OO
collected	.O
we	OU
know	OO
that	OO
we	OO
can	OO
improve	OO
those	OO
rates	.O
other	OU
countries	OO
like	OO
canada	,U
australia	OU
and	OO
the	OO
uk	OU
have	OO
nearly	OO
twice	OO
the	OO
amount	OO
of	OO
policewomen	.O
and	OU
new	OU
zealand	OU
is	OO
steadily	OO
marching	OO
towards	OO
their	OO
goal	OO
of	OO
recruit	OO
gender	OO
parity	OO
by	OO
2021	.O
other	OU
countries	OO
are	OO
actively	OO
working	OO
to	OO
increase	OO
the	OO
number	OO
of	OO
women	OO
in	OO
policing	,O
because	OO
they	OO
know	OO
of	OO
a	OO
vast	OO
body	OO
of	OO
research	OO
evidence	,O
spanning	OO
more	OO
than	OO
50	OO
years	,O
detailing	OO
the	OO
advantages	OO
to	OO
women	OO
in	OO
policing	.O
from	OU
that	OO
research	,O
we	OO
know	OO
that	OO
policewomen	OO
are	OO
less	OO
likely	OO
to	OO
use	OO
force	OO
or	OO
to	OO
be	OO
accused	OO
of	OO
excessive	OO
force	.O
we	OU
know	OO
that	OO
policewomen	OO
are	OO
less	OO
likely	OO
to	OO
be	OO
named	OO
in	OO
a	OO
lawsuit	OO
or	OO
a	OO
citizen	OO
complaint	.O
we	OU
know	OO
that	OO
the	OO
mere	OO
presence	OO
of	OO
a	OO
policewoman	OO
reduces	OO
the	OO
use	OO
of	OO
force	OO
among	OO
other	OO
officers	.O
and	OU
we	OO
know	OO
that	OO
policewomen	OO
are	OO
met	OO
with	OO
the	OO
same	OO
rates	OO
of	OO
force	OO
as	OO
their	OO
male	OO
counterparts	,O
and	OO
sometimes	OO
more	,O
and	OO
yet	OO
they're	OO
more	OO
successful	OO
in	OO
defusing	OO
violent	OO
or	OO
aggressive	OO
behavior	OO
overall	.O
so	OU
there	OO
are	OO
vast	OO
advantages	OO
to	OO
women	OO
in	OO
policing	,O
and	OO
we're	OO
losing	OO
them	OO
to	OO
arbitrary	OO
fitness	OO
standards	.O
the	OU
problem	OO
is	,O
the	OO
united	OU
states	OU
has	OO
nearly	OO
18,000	OO
police	OO
agencies	OO
—	OO
18,000	OO
agencies	OO
with	OO
wildly	OO
varying	OO
fitness	OO
standards	.O
we	OU
know	OO
that	OO
a	OO
majority	OO
of	OO
academies	OO
rely	OO
on	OO
a	OO
masculine	OO
ideal	OO
of	OO
policing	OO
that	OO
works	OO
to	OO
decrease	OO
the	OO
number	OO
of	OO
women	OO
in	OO
policing	.O
these	OU
types	OO
of	OO
academies	OO
overemphasize	OO
physical	OO

with	OO
much	OO
less	OO
attention	OO

to	OO

this	OU

that	OO

not	OO

the	OO

a	OO

of	OO
an	OO

that's	OU
the	OO
reality	OO
of	OO

these	OU
are	OO
my	OO

and	OU
we	OO
can	OO
reduce	OO
the	OO

in	OO

by	OO

the	OU

that	OO

for	OO
the	OO

that's	OO

without	OO

why	OU

us	OU

this	OO

with	OO

it's	OU
something	OO
called	OO
fouling	.O
now	,U
for	OO
all	OO
you	OO
non	OO
seafaring	OO
folk	,O
fouling	OO
is	OO
when	OO
things	OO
like	OO
algae	OO
and	OO
barnacles	OO
and	OO
other	OO
marine	OO
materials	OO
get	OO
stuck	OO
to	OO
the	OO
sides	OO
of	OO
ships	OO
and	OO
submarines	.O
used	OU
to	OO
be	OO
able	OO
to	OO
prevent	OO
this	OO
fouling	OO
by	OO
coating	OO
ships	OO
and	OO
submarines	OO
with	OO
toxic	OO
agents	,O
like	OO
heavy	OO

but	OO
these	OO
heavy	OO

aren't	OO
as	OO
effective	OO
at	OO
keeping	OO
ships	OO
clean	OO
as	OO
they	OO
used	OO
to	OO
be	.O
and	OU
we	OO
want	OO
clean	OO
ships	OO
because	OO
fouling	OO
on	OO
these	OO

actually	OO
makes	OO
them	OO
less	OO

in	OO
the	OO

and	OO
can	OO
be	OO
easier	OO
for	OO

to	OO

this	OU
is	OO
not	OO
good	.O
so	OU
several	OO
years	OO

the	OO
us	OU
office	OU

research	OU
called	OO
on	OO
one	OO
of	OO
my	OO

engineer	OO
scientist	OO
dr	.U
anthony	OU
brennan	,U
to	OO
devise	OO
a	OO
solution	OO
to	OO
prevent	OO
fouling	OO
without	OO
the	OO
use	OO
of	OO
these	OO
heavy	OO
metals	.O
see	,U
dr	.U
brennan	OU
was	OO
already	OO
investigating	OO
how	OO
things	OO

can	OO
prevent	OO
the	OO
attachment	OO
of	OO
organisms	OO

but	OU
dr	.U
brennan	OU
was	OO
struggling	.O
all	OU
of	OO
the	OO
engineered	OO
surfaces	OO
he	OO
came	OO
up	OO
with	OO
algae	OO
eventually	OO

and	OU
then	OO
brennan	OU
found	OO
himself	OO
at	OO
a	OO

in	OO
hawaii	,U
of	OO
all	OO

something	OO

manatee	,O
a	OO
whale	OO
and	OO
a	OO
shark	.O
what	OU
do	OO
you	OO
notice	?O
well	,U
right	.O
so	OU
the	OO
whale	OO
and	OO
the	OO
manatee	OO
are	OO
filthy	,O
but	OO
the	OO
shark	OO
is	OO
squeaky	OO
clean	.O
this	OU
is	OO
a	OO
property	OO
unique	OO
to	OO
all	OO
sharks	.O
the	OU
next	OO
time	OO
you	OO
watch	OO
shark	OU
week	,U
you'll	OO
notice	OO
each	OO
and	OO
every	OO
shark	OO
you	OO
see	OO
is	OO
pristine	.O
why	?U
brennan	OU
wanted	OO
to	OO
find	OO
out	.O
so	OU
with	OO
the	OO
help	OO
of	OO
some	OO
brave	OO
graduate	OO
students	,O
they	OO
set	OO
out	OO
to	OO
find	OO
a	OO
shark	.O
they	OU
found	OO
one	OO
in	OO
the	OO
shallow	OO
water	OO
and	OO
carefully	OO
took	OO
a	OO
mold	OO
of	OO
its	OO
skin	OO
using	OO
a	OO
dental	OO
impression	OO
material	.O
don't	OU
worry	.O
the	OU
shark	OO
wasn't	OO
harmed	OO
in	OO
the	OO
process	,O
although	OO
i'm	OU
sure	OO
he	OO
didn't	OO
appreciate	OO
it	.O
so	OU
the	OO
students	OO
took	OO
the	OO
mold	OO
back	OO
to	OO
the	OO
lab	OO
and	OO
put	OO
it	OO
under	OO
a	OO
microscope	,O
and	OO
this	OO
is	OO
what	OO
it	OO
looks	OO
like	.O
the	OU
sharkskin	OO
is	OO
comprised	OO
of	OO
little	OO
denticles	,O
and	OO
they	OO
overlap	OO
to	OO
create	OO
a	OO

on	OO
the	OO
sharkskin	.O
upon	OU
further	OO
investigation	,O
brennan	OU
and	OO
his	OO
team	OO
noticed	OO
that	OO
the	OO
texture	OO
on	OO
these	OO

is	OO
actually	OO
what's	OO
responsible	OO
for	OO
keeping	OO
sharks	OO
clean	.O
i'm	OU
a	OO
microbiologist	OO
and	OO

i	OU

this	OO

i've	OU
spent	OO
my	OO

trying	OO
to	OO
keep	OO

especially	OO
the	OO

this	OO
is	OO
a	OO
massive	OO
problem	.O
see	,U
what	OO
happens	OO
is	OO
bacteria	OO
who	OO

really	OO
normally	OO
good	OO
find	OO
themselves	OO
in	OO

they	OO
shouldn't	OO

as	OO
a	OO

of	OO
some	OO

sometime	OU
during	OO

bacteria	OO
latch	OO

the	OO

a	OO

device	,O
stay	OO
there	,O
and	OO
cause	OO
a	OO
serious	OO

and	OO
this	OO
makes	OO
it	OO
impossible	OO
for	OO
the	OO

take	OU
a	OO
look	OO
at	OO

notice	OU
the	OO

this	OU

you	OU

it	OO
used	OO

be	OO
we	OO
just	OO
used	OO
antibiotics	OO
to	OO
treat	OO
these	OO
types	OO
of	OO
infections	.O
antibiotics	OU
were	OO
an	OO
amazing	OO
drug	,O
for	OO
a	OO
while	.O
but	OU
eventually	,O
bacteria	OO
were	OO
exposed	OO
to	OO
antibiotics	OO
so	OO
frequently	OO
they	OO
were	OO
forced	OO
to	OO
adapt	.O
and	OU
survival	OO
is	OO
the	OO
key	OO
driver	OO
of	OO
evolution	,O
and	OO
that's	OO
what	OO
we're	OO
talking	OO
about	OO
here:	OO
bacterial	OO
evolution	.O
perhaps	OU
you've	OO
heard	OO
about	OO
this	OO
in	OO
the	OO

it's	OU
referred	OO
to	OO
as	OO
antimicrobial	OU
resistance	.U
the	OU
us	OU
centers	OU

call	OO
antimicrobial	OO
resistance	OO
one	OO
of	OO
the	OO
greatest	OO
public	OO
health	OO
challenges	OO
of	OO
our	OO
time	.O
illnesses	OU
that	OO
were	OO
once	OO
easily	OO
treatable	OO
are	OO
now	OO
untreatable	.O
in	OU
the	OO
us	OU
alone	OO
every	OO
year	,O
more	OO
than	OO
two	OO
million	OO
people	OO
will	OO
get	OO
an	OO
antibiotic	OO
resistant	OO
infection	,O
and	OO
over	OO
23,000	OO
people	OO
will	OO
die	OO
as	OO
a	OO
result	OO
of	OO
that	OO
infection	.O
the	OU
pharmaceutical	OO
industry	OO
is	OO
rushing	OO
to	OO
develop	OO
more	OO
and	OO
more	OO
and	OO
more	OO
antimicrobials	,O
desperately	OO
trying	OO
to	OO
outpace	OO
antimicrobial	OO
resistance	.O
but	OU
bacteria	OO
and	OO
germs	,O
they	OO
evolve	OO
so	OO
much	OO
more	OO
quickly	OO
than	OO
we	OO
could	OO
innovate	OO
ways	OO
to	OO
kill	OO
them	.O
it's	OU
clear	OO
the	OO
antimicrobial	OO
era	OO
is	OO
coming	OO
to	OO
an	OO
end	,O
so	OO
we	OO
have	OO
to	OO
think	OO
about	OO
this	OO
in	OO
a	OO
whole	OO
new	OO
way	.O
what	OU
if	OO
instead	OO
of	OO
trying	OO
to	OO
kill	OO
bacteria	OO
after	OO
they	OO
cause	OO
infections	,O
we	OO
simply	OO
make	OO
it	OO
harder	OO
for	OO
bacteria	OO
to	OO
stick	OO
to	OO
the	OO
surfaces	OO
of	OO
medical	OO
devices	OO
in	OO
the	OO
first	OO
place	?O
in	OU
other	OO
words	,O
we	OO
prevent	OO
these	OO
infections	OO
from	OO
occurring	OO
altogether	.O
that's	OU
what	OO
brings	OO
me	OO
back	OO
to	OO
what	OO
we've	OO
learned	OO
from	OO
sharks	.O
it's	OU
the	OO
texture	OO
of	OO
sharkskin	OO
that	OO
makes	OO
them	OO
resistant	OO
to	OO
fouling	.O
so	OU
what	OO
if	OO
we	OO
change	OO
the	OO
texture	OO
of	OO
medical	OO
devices	OO
to	OO
make	OO
them	OO
resistant	OO
to	OO
bacteria	OO
causing	OO
so	OO
many	OO
problems	?O
dr	.U
brennan	OU
knew	OO
he	OO
had	OO
a	OO
major	OO
medical	OO
breakthrough	OO
on	OO
his	OO
hands	.O
he	OU
called	OO
up	OO
some	OO
trusted	OO
friends	OO
right	OO
here	OO
in	OO
denver	OU
colorado	,U
and	OO
they	OO
started	OO
a	OO
company	,O
and	OO
they	OO
called	OO
it	OO
sharklet	OU
technologies	.U
in	OU
2013	,O
i	OU
joined	OO
the	OO
team	,O
and	OO
together	OO
we	OO
used	OO
engineered	OO
surfaces	OO
mimicking	OO
the	OO
skin	OO
of	OO
sharks	OO
to	OO
prevent	OO
bacteria	OO
and	OO
other	OO
medical	OO
complications	.O
our	OU
first	OO
commercial	OO
device	OO
is	OO
a	OO
urological	OO
catheter	,O
which	OO
doctors	OO
began	OO
using	OO
for	OO
patients	OO
just	OO
last	OO
year	.O
take	OU
a	OO
look	OO
at	OO
these	OO
example	OO
images	.O
the	OU
surface	OO
on	OO
the	OO
left	OO
is	OO
a	OO
smooth	OO
surface	,O
and	OO
the	OO
one	OO
on	OO
the	OO
right	OO
is	OO
a	OO
sharkskin	OO
like	OO
texture	.O
notice	OU
how	OO
much	OO
bacteria's	OO
on	OO
the	OO
smooth	OO
surface	OO
compared	OO
to	OO
the	OO
sharkskin	OO
like	OO
surface	?O
this	OU
is	OO
because	OO
the	OO
sharkskin	OO
like	OO
texture	OO
creates	OO
an	OO
inhospitable	OO
surface	OO
for	OO
bacterial	OO
attachment	OO
and	OO
growth	.O
it	OU
works	OO
on	OO
sharks	,O
and	OO
it	OO
works	OO
here	OO
too	OO
because	OO
the	OO
texture	OO
takes	OO
advantage	OO
of	OO
principles	OO
of	OO
surface	OO
energy	.O
now	,U
surface	OO
energy	OO
is	OO
really	OO
a	OO
description	OO
of	OO
a	OO
detailed	OO
property	OO
of	OO
a	OO
surface	.O
it	OU
can	OO
include	OO
things	OO
like	OO
water	OO
interaction	OO
or	OO
material	OO
stiffness	.O
the	OU
roughened	OO
sharkskin	OO
like	OO
texture	OO
creates	OO
a	OO
surface	OO
with	OO
greater	OO
surface	OO
energy	.O
you	OU
know	,O
we	OO
interact	OO
with	OO
surface	OO
energy	OO
changes	OO
all	OO
the	OO
time	.O
we	OU
often	OO
just	OO
don't	OO
notice	OO
it	.O
for	OU
example	,O
we	OO
like	OO
when	OO
rain	OO
beads	OO
up	OO
and	OO
runs	OO
off	OO
our	OO
car	,O
right	?O
well	,U
this	OO
happens	OO
best	OO
with	OO
a	OO
nice	OO
coat	OO
of	OO
wax	.O
wax	OU
is	OO
a	OO
material	OO
with	OO
greater	OO
surface	OO
energy	OO
characteristics	.O
now	,U
we	OO
can't	OO
coat	OO
medical	OO
devices	OO
in	OO
wax	,O
but	OO
we	OO
can	OO
change	OO
their	OO
surface	OO
texture	.O
and	OU
this	OO
approach	OO
works	OO
on	OO
all	OO
types	OO
of	OO
medical	OO
devices	,O
from	OO
catheters	OO
to	OO
pacemakers	,O
and	OO
it's	OO
effective	OO
against	OO
all	OO
types	OO
of	OO
bacteria	OO
and	OO
germs	.O
as	OU
it	OO
turns	OO
out	,O
we	OO
can	OO
actually	OO
do	OO
more	OO
than	OO
just	OO
bacteria	OO
proof	OO
medical	OO
devices	.O
we	OU
can	OO
prevent	OO
other	OO
medical	OO
complications	OO
through	OO
understanding	OO
the	OO

of	OO

energy	,O
things	OO
like	OO
frequent	OO

or	OO
poor	OO

interactions	.O
the	OU
next	OO
generation	OO
of	OO
medical	OO
device	OO
surfaces	OO
inspired	OO
by	OO
the	OO
skin	OO
of	OO
sharks	OO
will	OO
actually	OO
expand	OO
how	OO
medical	OO
devices	OO
are	OO
made	.O
really	OU
the	OO
core	OO
issue	OO
is	OO
that	OO
we	OO
create	OO
all	OO
types	OO
of	OO
sophisticated	OO
medical	OO
devices	,O
things	OO
to	OO
pump	OO
fluid	OO
into	OO
our	OO
blood	,O
keep	OO
our	OO
heart	OO
beating	OO
on	OO
pace	,O
or	OO
even	OO
stimulate	OO

activity	.O
but	OU
bad	OO
things	OO
happen	OO
when	OO
these	OO
devices	OO
don't	OO
interact	OO
well	OO
with	OO
our	OO
bodies'	OO
natural	OO
mechanisms	.O
we've	OU
actually	OO
discovered	OO
that	OO
we	OO
can	OO
improve	OO
how	OO
medical	OO
devices	OO
are	OO
tolerated	OO
through	OO
subtly	OO
tuning	OO
the	OO
surface	OO
energy	OO
characteristics	,O
like	OO
for	OO
example	,O
we	OO
can	OO
prevent	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
the	OO
excessive	OO
clotting	OO
that's	OO
occurring	OO
here	OO
on	OO
the	OO
smooth	OO
surface	,O
compared	OO
to	OO
the	OO
sharkskin	OO
like	OO
texture	.O
this	OU
means	OO
that	OO
we	OO
can	OO
actually	OO
match	OO
the	OO
required	OO
surface	OO
energy	OO
with	OO
the	OO
medical	OO
use	OO
to	OO
prevent	OO
complications	,O
all	OO
with	OO
the	OO
power	OO
of	OO
sharks	.O
ultimately	,U
as	OO
we	OO
continue	OO
to	OO
engineer	OO
smart	OO
surfaces	,O
we'll	OO
require	OO
fewer	OO
antimicrobials	,O
fewer	OO
chemicals	OO
and	OO
fewer	OO
harsh	OO
additives	,O
and	OO
this	OO
will	OO
make	OO

technology	OO
safer	OO
for	OO
all	OO

us	OO
to	OO

this	OU

in	OO

form	,O
to	OO
be	OO

it's	OO
also	OO
a	OO

how	OO

of	OO

you	.O
what	OU
if	OO
we	OO

to	OO
one	OO
based	OO
on	OO

the	OO

i	OU
want	OO
to	OO

about	OO
how	OO
changing	OO
the	OO
way	OO
we	OO
perceive	OO
sharks	OO
and	OO

with	OO
them	OO
could	OO
change	OO
our	OO

for	OO

but	OU
first	,O
i	OU
want	OO
to	OO
introduce	OO
you	OO
to	OO
someone	OO
who	OO

my	OO

she's	OU

she's	OO

what	OO

her	OO

is	OO
her	OO
very	OO
important	OO
work	OO
and	OO

what	OU
most	OO
people	OO
don't	OO
know	OO
is	OO
that	OO
without	OO
her	OO

none	OO
of	OO
our	OO

would	OO
be	OO
the	OO

and	OU
i	OU
wanted	OO
to	OO
describe	OO
her	OO
to	OO
you	OO
first	,O
before	OO
i	OU
showed	OO
you	OO
her	OO

because	OO
i've	OU
come	OO
to	OO
find	OO
that	,O
oftentimes	,O
we	OO
make	OO

based	OO
off	OO
of	OO

i've	OU

so	,U
please	OO
keep	OO
in	OO

the	OO
truth	OO
that	OO
often	OO
there's	OO
more	OO
than	OO

when	OO
you	OO
take	OO
time	OO
to	OO

this	OU

but	OU
sharks	OO
are	OO

right	?O
so	OU
that's	OO

of	OO
the	OO
problem	.O
most	OU

don't	OO

many	OO

things	OO
about	OO

they	OO

and	OO
many	OO
more	OO
people	OO
don't	OO
know	OO
that	OO
sharks	OO
are	OO
actually	OO
being	OO
decimated	,O
globally	,O
at	OO
a	OO
rate	OO
of	OO
over	OO
11,000	OO
every	OO
single	OO
hour	.O
that's	OU
more	OO
than	OO
three	OO
sharks	OO
every	OO
single	OO
second	.O
that	OU
translates	OO
to	OO
70	OO
100	OO
million	OO
sharks	OO
killed	OO
every	OO
year	.O
that's	OU
like	OO
killing	OO
everyone	OO
in	OO
spain	,U
austria	OU
and	OO
france	OU
every	OO
single	OO
year	.O
now	,U
according	OO
to	OO
fishing	OO
records	,O
over	OO
90%	OO
of	OO
sharks	OO
have	OO
been	OO
depleted	.O
according	OU
to	OO
the	OO
international	OU
union	OU
for	OO
conservation	OU
of	OO
nature	,U
over	OO
a	OO
third	OO
of	OO
all	OO

been	OO
wiped	OO
out	,O
or	OO
are	OO
facing	OO

or	OO
are	OO
vulnerable	OO
to	OO

so	,U
why	OO
such	OO
a	OO
mass	OO
slaughter	OO
of	OO
such	OO
an	OO
important	OO
and	OO
keystone	OO
species	?O
well	,U
some	OO
of	OO
it	OO
is	OO
due	OO
to	OO
silly	OO
things	OO
like	OO
souvenirs	OO

some	OU
of	OO
it	OO
is	OO
due	OO
to	OO
men	OO
and	OO
their	OO
inferiority	OO
complexes	.O
i'm	OU
guessing	.O
80%	OO
of	OO
long	OO
lining	OO
is	OO
bycatch	,O
and	OO
most	OO
of	OO
it	OO
is	OO
sharks	.O
culling	,U
which	OO
is	OO
probably	OO
this	OO
least	OO
intelligent	OO
reaction	OO
a	OO
country	OO
can	OO
have	OO
to	OO
an	OO
adverse	OO
shark	OO
human	OO
interaction;	OO
basically	,O
like	OO
shooting	OO
yourself	OO
in	OO
the	OO
foot	,O
from	OO
a	OO
behavioral	OO
standpoint	,O
also	OO
a	OO
waste	OO
and	OO
indiscriminate	OO
killer	.O
but	OU
the	OO
number	OO
one	OO
killer	OO
of	OO
sharks	,O
globally:	OO
a	OO
bowl	OO
of	OO
soup	.O
yes	,U
we	OO
are	OO
trading	OO
the	OO
health	OO
and	OO

of	OO
our	OO

and	OO

for	OO
a	OO
bowl	OO
of	OO
soup	.O
what's	OU
worse	,O
it's	OO
not	OO
even	OO
nutritious;	OO
it's	OO
actually	OO
toxic	.O
it's	OU
merely	OO
for	OO
the	OO
chinese	OU
culture	OO
belief	OO
that	OO
when	OO
they	OO
serve	OO
that	OO
soup	,O
it	OO
means	OO
that	OO
they're	OO

or	OO

but	OU
what	OO
is	OO
classy	OO
about	OO
catching	OO
a	OO
shark	,O
hacking	OO
off	OO
its	OO
fins	,O
oftentimes	OO
while	OO
it's	OO

alive	,O

the	OO

just	OO
to	OO
make	OO
yourself	OO
feel	OO
better	OO
about	OO
your	OO

consider:	OU
sharks	OO
have	OO
been	OO
evolving	OO
for	OO
over	OO
400	OO
million	OO
years;	OO
humans	,O
200,000	,O

we	OU

our	OO

like	OU
rhinos	OO
killed	OO
just	OO
for	OO
their	OO
horns	,O

killed	OO
just	OO
for	OO
their	OO

sharks	OO
are	OO
being	OO
killed	,O
slaughtered	,O
globally	,O
just	OO
for	OO
their	OO

now	,U
i	OU
love	OO
traveling	OO
the	OO
world	OO
and	OO
experiencing	OO
the	OO
diversity	OO
of	OO
cultures	,O
but	OO
there	OO
has	OO
to	OO
be	OO
a	OO
point	OO
when	OO
we	OO
re	OO
evaluate	OO
the	OO
relationship	OO
that	OO
we	OO
have	OO
with	OO
sharks	OO
and	OO
animals	,O
and	OO
look	OO
at	OO
how	OO
our	OO
cultures	OO
can	OO
adapt	OO
and	OO
evolve	OO
honorably	.O
an	OU
ancient	OO
chinese	OU
proverb	OO
says	OO
when	OO
you	OO
do	OO
not	OO
change	OO
your	OO
direction	,O
you	OO
may	OO
end	OO
up	OO
where	OO
you	OO
are	OO
heading	.O
so	OU
what	OO
if	OO
we	OO
were	OO
to	OO
adopt	OO
this	OO
idea	OO
and	OO
change	OO
the	OO
way	OO
we	OO
interact	OO
with	OO
sharks	?O
what	OU
would	OO
that	OO
look	OO
like	?O
well	,U
the	OO
great	OO
news	OO
is	OO
we	OO
already	OO
have	OO
concrete	OO
examples	,O
places	OO
like	OO
palau	,U
bahamas	,U
areas	OO
like	OO
cabo	OU
pulmo	,U
and	OO
palmyra	.U
in	OU
those	OO
areas	,O
reef	OO
and	OO
fish	OO
stocks	OO
are	OO
thriving	.O
ecotourism	OU
is	OO
bringing	OO
in	OO
over	OO
us	OU
$314	OO
million	OO
to	OO
local	OO
economies	,O
directly	OO
employing	OO
over	OO
10,000	OO
jobs	.O
this	OU
study	OO
by	OO
dr	OU
michele	OU
barnes	OU
and	OO
the	OO
university	OU
of	OO
british	OU
columbia	OU
is	OO
actually	OO
showing	OO
that	OO
that	OO
number	OO
will	OO
increase	,O
more	OO
than	OO
double	,O
in	OO
less	OO
than	OO
20	OO
years	.O
so	OU
$780	OO
million	,O
far	OO
outweighing	OO
the	OO
global	OO
fin	OO
trade	.O
so	OU
put	OO
at	OO
the	OO
most	OO
basic	OO
terms	,O
even	OO
on	OO
just	OO
the	OO
monetary	OO
level	,O
which	OO
is	OO
usually	OO
what	OO
politicians	OO
care	OO
about	,O
a	OO
live	OO
shark	OO
is	OO
worth	OO
more	OO
than	OO
a	OO
dead	OO
shark	.O
and	OU
what's	OO
great	OO
is	,O
these	OO
shark	OO
ecotourism	OO
programs	,O
they	OO
can	OO
support	OO
research	.O
i	OU
was	OO
working	OO
out	OO
with	OO
dr	OU
mauricio	OU
hoyos	,U
we	OO
were	OO
tagging	,O
taking	OO
biopsies	,O
and	OO
i	OU
was	OO
wondering:	OO
is	OU
any	OO
of	OO
this	OO
conservation	OO
based	OO
research	OO
going	OO
to	OO
make	OO
a	OO
difference	OO
before	OO
these	OO
guys	OO
are	OO
just	OO
wiped	OO
out	OO
off	OO
the	OO
planet	?O
then	OU
one	OO
day	,O
20	OO
meters	OO
underwater	,O
doing	OO
a	OO
population	OO
count	OO
surrounded	OO
by	OO
these	OO
beautiful	OO
sharks	,O
i	OU
was	OO
realizing	OO
by	OO
the	OO
time	OO
i	OU
gather	,O
process	OO
and	OO
publish	OO
my	OO
studies	,O
another	OO
3	OO
6	OO
million	OO
sharks	OO
will	OO
be	OO
killed	.O
so	OU
why	OO
study	OO
something	OO
that's	OO
being	OO
eradicated	OO
the	OO
rate	OO
the	OO
sharks	OO
are	OO
and	OO
not	OO
do	OO
anything	OO
about	OO
it	.O
so	OU
i	OU
opened	OO
my	OO
research	OO
to	OO
the	OO
public	.O
i	OU
developed	OO
a	OO
program	,O
where	OO
people	OO
could	OO

to	OO

about	OO

from	OO
a	OO
scientific	OO

i	OU

who	OO
is	OO
a	OO
well	OO
known	OO
shark	OO
and	OO
marine	OO

we	OU

this	OO

that's	OO
research	OO
and	OO
conservation	OO

and	OO
opened	OO
it	OO
to	OO
the	OO

so	OO
they	OO

about	OO
their	OO
biology	,O

how	OO
to	OO

with	OO
them	OO
safely	,O
answers	OO
all	OO
those	OO
questions	OO
people	OO
don't	OO
know	OO
about	OO

the	OU
cool	OO
thing	OO
is	OO
people	OO
actually	OO
get	OO
to	OO
get	OO
in	OO
the	OO
water	OO
with	OO
us	OO
and	OO
see	OO
for	OO
themselves	,O

what	OO
sharks	OO
are	OO
really	OO
like	.O
it's	OU
such	OO
a	OO

program	OO
as	OO

up	OO
for	OO
sharks	OO
from	OO
a	OO
first	OO

we	OU

a	OO

you	OO

after	OU
90	OO

who	OO

so	OO
great	OO
for	OO
her	OO
species	,O
a	OO
great	OO
representative	.O
at	OU
the	OO
time	OO
when	OO
we	OO
released	OO
it	,O
it	OO
was	OO
because	OO
there	OO

a	OO

in	OO
the	OO

from	OO

to	OO
alaska	OU
to	OO

to	OO

an	OO
area	OO
where	OO
juansharks	OO
and	OO
i	OU
grew	OO
up	OO
diving	OO
with	OO

with	OO
white	OO
sharks	OO
specifically	.O
we	OU

much	OO
time	OO
with	OO
them	,O
studying	OO

so	OU
what	OO
do	OO
you	OO
do	OO
when	OO
you	OO
hear	OO
someone	OO
you	OO
love	,O
care	OO
about	,O
understand	,O
is	OO
being	OO

something	.U
so	,U
we	OO
thought	,O
with	OO
water	OU

we'd	OO
try	OO
and	OO
use	OO
inspiring	OO
photography	OO
and	OO
videography	OO
to	OO
inspire	OO
people	OO
to	OO
care	.O
we	OU
needed	OO
people	OO
to	OO

a	OO
second	OO

a	OO
second	OO

they	OU

when	OU
they	OO

i'm	OU
sure	OO
you	OO
guys	OO
all	OO
know	,O
it's	OO
not	OO
usually	OO
good	OO
press	.O
so	OU
we	OO
were	OO
successful	.O
we	OU
wanted	OO
to	OO
show	OO
the	OO
natural	OO
beauty	OO
of	OO
sharks	.O
but	OU
most	OO
often	,O
when	OO
people	OO
see	OO
a	OO
beautiful	OO
image	OO
like	OO
this	,O
they	OO
just	OO
think	OO
it's	OO
just	OO
on	OO
its	OO
way	OO
to	OO
eat	OO
the	OO
next	OO

right	?O
so	,U
we	OO
want	OO
to	OO
do	OO
the	OO
anti	OO
jaws	.U
the	OU
little	OO
blond	OO
girl	,O
she	OO
gets	OO
eaten	OO
in	OO
the	OO

right	?O
so	OU
what's	OO
it	OO
like	OO
in	OO
reality	?O
well	,U
i've	OU
been	OO
working	OO
with	OO
them	OO
for	OO
a	OO

right	?O
we	OU
dive	OO
to	OO

so	OO
i	OU
wanted	OO
to	OO

i	OU
wanted	OO
people	OO
to	OO
be	OO
able	OO
to	OO
connect	,O
see	OO
another	OO
side	OO
of	OO
these	OO
animals	,O
realize	OO
that	OO
we	OO
can	OO
coexist	.O
but	OU
in	OO
order	OO
to	OO
coexist	,O
they	OO
have	OO
to	OO
exist	,O
and	OO
there's	OO
so	OO
much	OO
more	OO
to	OO
these	OO
animals	OO
than	OO
meets	OO
the	OO
eye	.O
when	OU
you	OO
take	OO
the	OO
time	OO
to	OO
get	OO
to	OO
know	OO
somebody	,O
you	OO
know	,O
you	OO
can	OO
understand	OO
that	OO
maybe	OO
there's	OO
more	OO
to	OO
them	.O
and	OU
so	OO
i	OU
wanted	OO
to	OO
share	OO
that	OO
with	OO
the	OO
world	.O
and	OU
i	OU
have	OO
to	OO
give	OO
the	OO
disclaimer	OO
i	OU
mean	,O
there's	OO
just	OO
so	OO
many	OO
things	OO
that	OO
i	OU
would	OO
love	OO
to	OO
share	OO
with	OO
you	OO
guys	OO
—	OO
but	OO
i	OU
do	OO
have	OO
to	OO
give	OO
the	OO
disclaimer	OO
that	OO
they	OO
deserve	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
respect	.O
not	OO
fear	,O
but	OO
they	OO
are	OO
apex	OO
predators	,O
they	OO
do	OO
have	OO
a	OO
role	.O
and	OO
we	OO
need	OO
them	OO
for	OO
that	OO
role	,O
it's	OO
very	OO
important	.O
i	OU
mean	,O
i	OU
could	OO
cite	OO
study	OO
after	OO
study	OO
after	OO
study	,O
showing	OO
the	OO
importance	OO
of	OO
that	.O
you	OU
know	,O
if	OO
i	OU
wanted	OO
to	OO
go	OO
out	OO
into	OO
the	OO
african	OU
savanna	OO
and	OO
pat	OO
a	OO
lion	,O
you	OO
know	OO
what	OO
i	OU
would	OO
do	?O
i	OU
would	OO
call	OO
up	OO
the	OO
lion	OO
whisperer	,O
and	OO
i'd	OU
go	OO
hang	OO
out	OO
with	OO
him	,O
and	OO
i'd	OU
learn	,O
and	OO
i'd	OU
study	OO
from	OO
him	,O
out	OO
of	OO
respect	OO
for	OO
the	OO
animal	OO
because	OO
of	OO
its	OO
reputation	.O
so	,U
while	OO
i	OU
understand	OO
that	,O
especially	OO
the	OO
way	OO
that	OO
they	OO
are	OO
portrayed	OO
in	OO
the	OO
media	,O
that	OO
people	OO
are	OO
afraid	OO
of	OO
them	,O
you	OO
shouldn't	OO
be	OO
afraid	OO
of	OO
them;	OO
you	OO
should	OO
just	OO
respect	OO
them	.O
they	OO
are	OO
beautiful	OO
animals	,O
there's	OO
so	OO
much	OO
more	OO
to	OO
them	.O
so	OU
if	OO
there's	OO
one	OO
thing	OO
that	OO
bella	OU
has	OO
taught	OO
me	,O
it's	OO
that	,O
like	OO
bella	,U
we	OO
can	OO
all	OO
positively	OO
change	OO
and	OO
influence	OO
our	OO
environments	OO
for	OO
the	OO
better	.O
all	OU
we	OO
need	OO
to	OO
do	OO
is	OO
take	OO
action	.O
in	OU
the	OO
words	OO
of	OO
jane	OU

every	OU

we	OO
make	OO
an	OO

we	OO

they	OU

very	OO
true	OO
to	OO
the	OO

and	OO
released	OO
a	OO
beautiful	OO
piece	,O
but	OO
there	OO
are	OO
so	OO
many	OO
other	OO
things	,O
other	OO

pieces	OO
we	OO
could	OO
do	,O
even	OO
just	OO
writing	OO
to	OO
a	OO
restaurant	,O
asking	OO
them	OO
not	OO

serve	OO
shark	OO

new	OU
campaigns	,O
political	OO
policies	,O
the	OO
ideas	OO
are	OO
endless	.O
what	OU
it	OO
comes	OO
down	OO
to	OO
is:	OO
yeah	,U
knowledge	OO

it's	OO
nothing	OO
without	OO

i	OU
love	OO

you	OU

in	OU

my	OU

boy	,O
who	OO
would	OO
grow	OO
up	OO
to	OO
be	OO
the	OO

of	OO

when	OO
i	OU
turned	OO
out	OO
to	OO
be	OO
a	OO
girl	,O
they	OO
named	OO
me	OO
nanfu	OU
anyway	.O
i	OU
was	OO
born	OO
in	OO
1985	,O
six	OO
years	OO
before	OO

announced	OO
its	OO
one	OO

policy	.O
right	OU
after	OO

the	OO
local	OO

my	OO
mom	OO
to	OO
be	OO
sterilized	.O
my	OU
grandpa	OO
stood	OO
up	OO
to	OO
the	OO
officials	,O
because	OO
he	OO
wanted	OO
a	OO

to	OO
carry	OO
on	OO
the	OO

eventually	,U
my	OO

a	OO

they	OO
had	OO
to	OO
wait	OO
for	OO
five	OO
years	OO
and	OO
pay	OO
a	OO
substantial	OO
fine	.O
growing	OU
up	,O
my	OO
brother	OO
and	OO
i	OU
were	OO
surrounded	OO
by	OO
children	OO
from	OO
one	OO
child	OO
families	.O
i	OU
remember	OO
feeling	OO
a	OO
sense	OO
of	OO
shame	OO
because	OO
i	OU
had	OO
a	OO
younger	OO

i	OU
felt	OO
like	OO
our	OO

did	OO
something	OO
wrong	OO
for	OO
having	OO
two	OO
children	.O
at	OU
the	OO
time	,O
i	OU
didn't	OO
question	OO
where	OO
this	OO
sense	OO
of	OO
shame	OO
and	OO
guilt	OO
came	OO
from	.O
a	OU
year	OO
and	OO
a	OO
half	OO
ago	,O
i	OU
had	OO
my	OO
own	OO
first	OO
child	.O
it	OU
was	OO
the	OO
best	OO
thing	OO
that	OO
ever	OO
happened	OO
in	OO
my	OO
life	.O
becoming	OU
a	OO
mother	OO
gave	OO
me	OO
a	OO
totally	OO
new	OO
perspective	OO
on	OO
my	OO
own	OO
childhood	,O
and	OO
it	OO
brought	OO
back	OO
my	OO
memories	OO
of	OO
early	OO
life	OO
in	OO
china	.U
for	OU
the	OO
past	OO
three	OO
decades	,O
everyone	OO
in	OO
my	OO
family	OO
had	OO
to	OO
apply	OO
for	OO
a	OO
permission	OO
from	OO
the	OO
government	OO
to	OO
have	OO
a	OO
child	.O
and	OU
i	OU
wondered	OO
what	OO
it	OO
was	OO
like	OO
for	OO
people	OO
who	OO
lived	OO
under	OO
the	OO
one	OO
child	OO
policy	.O
so	OU
i	OU
decided	OO
to	OO
make	OO
a	OO
documentary	OO
about	OO
it	.O
one	OU
of	OO
the	OO
people	OO
i	OU
interviewed	OO
was	OO
the	OO
midwife	OO
who	OO
delivered	OO
all	OO
of	OO
the	OO
babies	OO
born	OO
in	OO
my	OO
village	,O
including	OO
myself	.O
she	OU
was	OO
84	OO
years	OO
old	OO
when	OO
i	OU
interviewed	OO
her	.O
i	OU
asked	OO
her	,O
do	OU
you	OO
remember	OO
how	OO
many	OO
babies	OO
you	OO
delivered	OO
throughout	OO
your	OO
career	?O
she	OU
didn't	OO
have	OO
a	OO
number	OO
for	OO
deliveries	.O
she	OU
said	OO
she	OO
had	OO
performed	OO
60,000	OO
forced	OO
abortions	OO
and	OO
sterilizations	.O
sometimes	,U
she	OO
said	,O
a	OO
late	OO
term	OO
fetus	OO
would	OO
survive	OO
an	OO
abortion	,O
and	OO
she	OO
would	OO
kill	OO
the	OO
baby	OO
after	OO
delivering	OO
it	.O
she	OU
remembered	OO
how	OO
her	OO
hands	OO
would	OO
tremble	OO
as	OO
she	OO
did	OO
the	OO
work	.O
her	OU
story	OO
shocked	OO
me	.O
when	OU
i	OU
set	OO
out	OO
to	OO
make	OO
the	OO
film	,O
i	OU
expected	OO
it	OO
would	OO
be	OO
a	OO
simple	OO
story	OO
of	OO
perpetrators	OO
and	OO
victims	.O
people	OU
who	OO
carried	OO
out	OO
the	OO
policy	OO
and	OO
people	OO
who	OO
are	OO
living	OO
with	OO
the	OO
consequences	.O
but	OU
that	OO
wasn't	OO
what	OO
i	OU
saw	.O
as	OU
i	OU
was	OO
finishing	OO
my	OO
interview	OO
with	OO
the	OO
midwife	,O
i	OU
noticed	OO
an	OO
area	OO
in	OO
her	OO
house	OO
that	OO
was	OO
decorated	OO
with	OO
elaborate	OO
homemade	OO
flags	.O
and	OU
each	OO
flag	OO
has	OO
a	OO
picture	OO
of	OO
a	OO
baby	OO
on	OO
it	.O
these	OU
were	OO
flags	OO
that	OO
were	OO
sent	OO
by	OO
families	OO
whom	OO
she	OO
helped	OO
treat	OO
their	OO
infertility	OO
problems	.O
she	OU
explained	OO
that	OO
she	OO
had	OO
had	OO
enough	OO
of	OO
performing	OO
abortions	OO
and	OO
sterilizations	OO
—	OO
that	OO
the	OO
only	OO
work	OO
she	OO
did	OO
now	OO
was	OO
to	OO
help	OO
families	OO
have	OO
babies	.O
she	OU
said	OO
she	OO
was	OO
full	OO
of	OO
guilt	OO
for	OO
carrying	OO
out	OO
the	OO
one	OO
child	OO
policy	,O
and	OO
she	OO
hoped	OO
that	OO
by	OO
helping	OO
families	OO
have	OO
babies	,O
she	OO
could	OO
counteract	OO
what	OO
she	OO
did	OO
in	OO
the	OO
past	.O
it	OU
became	OO
clear	OO
to	OO
me	OO
she	,O
too	,O
was	OO
a	OO
victim	OO
of	OO
the	OO
policy	.O
every	OU
voice	OO
was	OO
telling	OO
her	OO
that	OO
what	OO
she	OO
did	OO
was	OO
right	OO
and	OO
necessary	OO
for	OO
china's	OU
survival	.O
and	OU
she	OO
did	OO
what	OO
she	OO
thought	OO
was	OO
right	OO
for	OO
her	OO
country	.O
i	OU
know	OO
how	OO
strong	OO
that	OO
message	OO
was	.O
it	OU
was	OO
everywhere	OO
around	OO
myself	OO
when	OO
i	OU
grew	OO
up	.O
it	OU
was	OO
printed	OO
on	OO
matches	,O
playing	OO
cards	,O

the	OU
propaganda	OO
praising	OO
the	OO
one	OO
child	OO
policy	OO
was	OO
everywhere	OO
around	OO
us	.O
and	OU
so	OO
were	OO
the	OO
threats	OO
against	OO
disobeying	OO
it	.O
the	OU
message	OO
seeped	OO
into	OO
our	OO
minds	OO
so	OO
much	OO
so	OO
that	OO
i	OU
grew	OO
up	OO
feeling	OO
embarrassed	OO
for	OO
having	OO
a	OO
younger	OO
brother	.O
with	OU
each	OO
person	OO
i	OU
filmed	,O
i	OU
saw	OO
how	OO
their	OO
minds	OO
and	OO
hearts	OO
can	OO
be	OO
influenced	OO
by	OO
the	OO
propaganda	,O
and	OO
how	OO
their	OO
willingness	OO
to	OO
make	OO
sacrifices	OO
for	OO
the	OO
greater	OO
good	OO
can	OO
be	OO
twisted	OO
into	OO
something	OO
very	OO
dark	OO
and	OO
tragic	.O
china	OU
is	OO
not	OO
the	OO
only	OO
place	OO
where	OO
this	OO
happens	.O
there	OU
is	OO
no	OO
country	OO
on	OO

where	OO

and	OU
in	OO
societies	OO
that	OO
are	OO
supposed	OO
to	OO
be	OO
more	OO
open	OO
and	OO
free	OO
than	OO
china	,U
it	OO
can	OO
be	OO
even	OO
harder	OO
to	OO
recognize	OO
what	OO

it	OU
hides	OO

every	OU

thank	OU
you	.O
recently	,U
the	OO
leadership	OO
team	OO
of	OO

that	OO

when	OO

a	OO
really	OO
crucial	OO
issue	,O
this	OO

to	OO

with	OO
the	OO

because	OO
the	OO
unexpected	OO
is	OO

the	OO

it's	OU
why	OO

are	OO
reluctant	OO
to	OO
predict	OO
anything	OO
more	OO
than	OO
400	OO
days	OO
out	.O
why	?U
because	OU
over	OO
the	OO
last	OO
20	OO
or	OO
30	OO
years	,O
much	OO
of	OO
the	OO
world	OO
has	OO
gone	OO
from	OO
being	OO
complicated	OO
to	OO
being	OO
complex	OO
—	OO
which	OO
means	OO
that	OO
yes	,O
there	OO
are	OO
patterns	,O
but	OO
they	OO
don't	OO
repeat	OO
themselves	OO
regularly	.O
it	OU
means	OO
that	OO
very	OO
small	OO
changes	OO
can	OO
make	OO
a	OO
disproportionate	OO
impact	.O
and	OU
it	OO
means	OO
that	OO
expertise	OO
won't	OO
always	OO
suffice	,O
because	OO
the	OO
system	OO
just	OO
keeps	OO
changing	OO
too	OO
fast	.O
so	OU
what	OO
that	OO
means	OO
is	OO
that	OO
there's	OO
a	OO
huge	OO
amount	OO
in	OO
the	OO
world	OO
that	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
defies	OO

now	.O
it's	OU
why	OO
the	OO
bank	OU
of	OO
england	OU
will	OO
say	OO
yes	,O
there	OO
will	OO
be	OO
another	OO

but	OO
we	OO

why	OO
or	OO
when	.O
we	OU

that	OO

but	OO
we	OO
can't	OO
predict	OO
where	OO

break	OO
out	,O
and	OO
we	OO
don't	OO
know	OO
which	OO

it's	OU
why	OO
companies	OO

blindsided	OO
when	OO
plastic	OO
straws	OO

bags	OO
and	OO

water	OO
go	OO
from	OO

to	OO
rejects	OO
overnight	,O
and	OO
baffled	OO
when	OO
a	OO
change	OO
in	OO

in	OU
an	OO

so	OO

forecasting	,O
efficiency	OO
won't	OO
just	OO

us	,O
it	OO

our	OO

how	OO

the	OO

what	OU

us	?O
what	OU
sort	OO
of	OO

we	OO
be	OO
sure	OO
to	OO
defend	?O
i	OU
think	OO
that	,O
where	OO
in	OO
the	OO
past	OO
we	OO
used	OO
to	OO
think	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
about	OO
just	OO
in	OO
time	OO
management	,O
now	OO
we	OO
have	OO
to	OO
start	OO
thinking	OO
about	OO
just	OO
in	OO
case	,O
preparing	OO
for	OO
events	OO
that	OO
are	OO
generally	OO
certain	OO
but	OO
specifically	OO
remain	OO
ambiguous	.O
one	OU
example	OO
of	OO
this	OO
is	OO
the	OO
coalition	OU
for	OO
epidemic	OU
preparedness	,U
cepi	.U
we	OU
know	OO
there	OO
will	OO
be	OO
more	OO
epidemics	OO
in	OO
future	,O
but	OO
we	OO
don't	OO
know	OO
where	OO
or	OO
when	OO
or	OO
what	.O
so	OU
we	OO
can't	OO
plan	.O
but	OU
we	OO
can	OO
prepare	.O
so	OU
cepi's	OU
developing	OO
multiple	OO
vaccines	OO
for	OO
multiple	OO
diseases	,O
knowing	OO
that	OO
they	OO
can't	OO
predict	OO
which	OO
vaccines	OO
are	OO
going	OO
to	OO
work	OO
or	OO
which	OO
diseases	OO
will	OO
break	OO
out	.O
so	OU
some	OO
of	OO
those	OO
vaccines	OO
will	OO
never	OO
be	OO
used	.O
that's	OU
inefficient	.O
but	OU
it's	OO
robust	,O
because	OO
it	OO
provides	OO
more	OO
options	,O
and	OO
it	OO
means	OO
that	OO
we	OO
don't	OO
depend	OO
on	OO
a	OO
single	OO
technological	OO
solution	.O
epidemic	OU
responsiveness	OO
also	OO
depends	OO
hugely	OO
on	OO
people	OO
who	OO
know	OO
and	OO
trust	OO
each	OO
other	.O
but	OU
those	OO
relationships	OO
take	OO
time	OO
to	OO
develop	,O
time	OO
that	OO
is	OO
always	OO
in	OO
short	OO
supply	OO
when	OO
an	OO
epidemic	OO
breaks	OO
out	.O
so	OU
cepi	OU
is	OO
developing	OO
relationships	,O
friendships	,O
alliances	OO
now	OO
knowing	OO
that	OO
some	OO
of	OO
those	OO
may	OO
never	OO
be	OO
used	.O
that's	OU
inefficient	,O
a	OO
waste	OO
of	OO
time	,O
perhaps	,O
but	OO
it's	OO
robust	.O
you	OU
can	OO
see	OO
robust	OO
thinking	OO
in	OO
financial	OO
services	,O
too	.O
in	OU
the	OO
past	,O
banks	OO
used	OO
to	OO
hold	OO
much	OO
less	OO
capital	OO
than	OO
they're	OO
required	OO
to	OO
today	,O
because	OO
holding	OO
so	OO
little	OO
capital	,O
being	OO
too	OO
efficient	OO
with	OO
it	,O
is	OO
what	OO
made	OO
the	OO
banks	OO
so	OO
fragile	OO
in	OO
the	OO
first	OO
place	.O
now	,U
holding	OO
more	OO
capital	OO
looks	OO
and	OO
is	OO
inefficient	.O
but	OU
it's	OO
robust	,O
because	OO
it	OO
protects	OO
the	OO
financial	OO
system	OO
against	OO
surprises	.O
countries	OU
that	OO
are	OO
really	OO
serious	OO
about	OO
climate	OO
change	OO
know	OO
that	OO
they	OO
have	OO
to	OO
adopt	OO
multiple	OO
solutions	,O
multiple	OO
forms	OO
of	OO
renewable	OO
energy	,O
not	OO
just	OO
one	.O
the	OU
countries	OO
that	OO
are	OO
most	OO
advanced	OO
have	OO
been	OO
working	OO
for	OO
years	OO
now	,O
changing	OO
their	OO
water	OO
and	OO
food	OO
supply	OO
and	OO
healthcare	OO
systems	,O
because	OO
they	OO
recognize	OO
that	OO
by	OO
the	OO
time	OO
they	OO
have	OO
certain	OO
prediction	,O
that	OO
information	OO
may	OO
very	OO
well	OO
come	OO
too	OO
late	.O
you	OU
can	OO
take	OO
the	OO
same	OO
approach	OO
to	OO
trade	OO
wars	,O
and	OO
many	OO
countries	OO
do	.O
instead	OU
of	OO
depending	OO
on	OO
a	OO
single	OO
huge	OO
trading	OO
partner	,O
they	OO
try	OO
to	OO
be	OO
everybody's	OO
friends	,O
because	OO
they	OO
know	OO
they	OO
can't	OO
predict	OO
which	OO
markets	OO
might	OO
suddenly	OO
become	OO
unstable	.O
it's	OU
time	OO
consuming	OO
and	OO
expensive	,O
negotiating	OO
all	OO
these	OO
deals	,O
but	OO
it's	OO
robust	OO
because	OO
it	OO
makes	OO
their	OO
whole	OO
economy	OO
better	OO
defended	OO
against	OO
shocks	.O
it's	OU
particularly	OO
a	OO
strategy	OO
adopted	OO
by	OO
small	OO
countries	OO
that	OO
know	OO
they'll	OO
never	OO
have	OO
the	OO
market	OO
muscle	OO
to	OO
call	OO
the	OO
shots	,O
so	OO
it's	OO
just	OO
better	OO
to	OO
have	OO
too	OO
many	OO
friends	.O
but	OU
if	OO
you're	OO
stuck	OO
in	OO
one	OO
of	OO
these	OO
organizations	OO
that's	OO
still	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
captured	OO
by	OO
the	OO
efficiency	OO
myth	,O
how	OO
do	OO
you	OO
start	OO
to	OO
change	OO
it	?O
try	OU
some	OO
experiments	.O
in	OU
the	OO
netherlands	,U
home	OO
care	OO
nursing	OO
used	OO
to	OO
be	OO
run	OO
pretty	OO
much	OO
like	OO
the	OO
supermarket:	OO
standardized	OO
and	OO
prescribed	OO
work	OO
to	OO
the	OO
minute:	OO
nine	OO
minutes	OO
on	OO
monday	,U
seven	OO
minutes	OO
on	OO
wednesday	,U
eight	OO
minutes	OO
on	OO
friday	.U
the	OU
nurses	OO
hated	OO
it	.O
so	OU
one	OO
of	OO
them	,O
jos	OU
de	OO
blok	,U
proposed	OO
an	OO
experiment	.O
since	OU
every	OO
patient	OO
is	OO
different	,O
and	OO
we	OO
don't	OO
quite	OO
know	OO
exactly	OO
what	OO
they'll	OO
need	,O
why	OO
don't	OO
we	OO
just	OO
leave	OO
it	OO
to	OO
the	OO
nurses	OO
to	OO
decide	?O
sound	OU
reckless	?O
in	OU
his	OO
experiment	,O
jos	OU
found	OO
the	OO
patients	OO
got	OO
better	OO
in	OO
half	OO
the	OO
time	,O
and	OO
costs	OO
fell	OO
by	OO
30	OO
percent	.O
when	OU
i	OU
asked	OO
jos	OU
what	OO
had	OO
surprised	OO
him	OO
about	OO
his	OO
experiment	,O
he	OO
just	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
laughed	OO
and	OO
he	OO
said	,O
well	,U
i	OU
had	OO
no	OO
idea	OO
it	OO
could	OO
be	OO
so	OO
easy	OO
to	OO
find	OO
such	OO
a	OO
huge	OO
improvement	,O
because	OO
this	OO
isn't	OO
the	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
thing	OO
you	OO
can	OO
know	OO
or	OO
predict	OO
sitting	OO
at	OO
a	OO
desk	OO
or	OO
staring	OO
at	OO
a	OO
computer	OO
screen	.O
so	OU
now	OO
this	OO
form	OO
of	OO
nursing	OO
has	OO
proliferated	OO
across	OO
the	OO
netherlands	OU
and	OO
around	OO
the	OO
world	.O
but	OU
in	OO
every	OO
new	OO
country	OO
it	OO
still	OO
starts	OO
with	OO
experiments	,O
because	OO
each	OO
place	OO
is	OO
slightly	OO
and	OO
unpredictably	OO
different	.O
of	OU
course	,O
not	OO
all	OO
experiments	OO
work	.O
jos	OU
tried	OO
a	OO
similar	OO
approach	OO
to	OO
the	OO
fire	OO
service	OO
and	OO
found	OO
it	OO
didn't	OO
work	OO
because	OO
the	OO
service	OO
is	OO
just	OO
too	OO
centralized	.O
failed	OU
experiments	OO
look	OO
inefficient	,O
but	OO
they're	OO
often	OO
the	OO
only	OO
way	OO
you	OO
can	OO
figure	OO
out	OO
how	OO
the	OO
real	OO
world	OO
works	.O
so	OU
now	OO
he's	OO
trying	OO
teachers	.O
experiments	OU
like	OO
that	OO
require	OO
creativity	OO
and	OO
not	OO
a	OO
little	OO
bravery	.O
in	OU

the	OU

putting	OO
a	OO

on	OO
a	OO

that	OO

i	OU

i	OU

a	OO

gone	OO

these	OU
were	OO
frank	,O

many	OU

just	OO

i	OU
asked	OO
them:	OO
what	OU
kept	OO
you	OO
going	OO
through	OO
this	?O
and	OU
they	OO
all	OO
had	OO
exactly	OO
the	OO

it	OU
wasn't	OO
data	OO
or	OO

they	OO
said	.O
it	OU
was	OO
my	OO

my	OO

who	OO
kept	OO
me	OO
going	.O
one	OU
added	,O
it	OU
was	OO
pretty	OO
much	OO
the	OO
opposite	OO
of	OO
the	OO

but	OU
then	OO
i	OU
went	OO
and	OO
i	OU
talked	OO
to	OO
a	OO

and	OO
i	OU
asked	OO
them	,O
who	OU
are	OO
your	OO

they	OO
just	OO

there's	OU
no	OO

they're	OU
too	OO

it's	OU
not	OO

them	OO

when	OO

it	,O
a	OO

of	OO

the	OU
harder	,O
deeper	OO
truth	OO
is	OO
that	OO
the	OO

that	OO
we	OO

it	OO
till	OO
we	OO

there	.O
but	OU
that's	OO
ok	,U
because	OO
we	OO

it	.O
we	OU

victor	OU

that's	OU
the	OO

i	OU
guess	OO
i	OU
read	OO
too	OO
much	OO
jules	OU
verne	OU
as	OO
a	OO
young	OO

and	OO
so	OO
for	OO
the	OO
last	OO
four	OO

i've	OU
led	OO
a	OO

to	OO
design	OO

the	OO
most	OO

i	OU
have	OO
the	OO

this	OO
was	OO
us	OO
in	OO

for	OO
the	OO

and	OU
nobody's	OO

that's	OU
just	OO
you	.O

no	.U

now	OO
everybody	OO

db:	OU
who	OU

that	?O

i	OU

everyone	OO
has	OO
seen	OO
the	OO

in	OO
the	OO
last	OO
10	,O
15	OO

you	OU
have	OO
a	OO

that	OO

the	OO

—	OO
those	OO

and	OO
we're	OO

it's	OO
a	OO

to	OO
places	OO
that	OO
have	OO
never	OO
been	OO
explored	OO
before	,O
and	OO
the	OO
oceans	OO
of	OO
the	OO
world	OO
is	OO
—	OO
it's	OO
almost	OO
a	OO
cliché	OO
to	OO
say	OO
it's	OO
70	OO
percent	OO
of	OO
our	OO
entire	OO
planet	,O
and	OO
of	OO
that	,O
95	OO
percent	OO
is	OO
unexplored	.O
so	OU
what	OO
we're	OO
trying	OO
to	OO
do	OO
with	OO
our	OO
expedition	OO
is	OO
to	OO
build	OO
and	OO
prove	OO
out	OO
a	OO
submersible	OO
that	OO
can	OO
go	OO
to	OO
any	OO
point	OO
on	OO
the	OO
bottom	OO
of	OO
the	OO
planet	OO
to	OO
explore	OO
the	OO
60	OO
percent	OO
of	OO
this	OO
planet	OO
that	OO
is	OO
still	OO
unexplored	.O
db:	OU
you	OU
need	OO
a	OO
pretty	OO
cool	OO
tool	OO
to	OO
do	OO
that	,O
right	?O
vv:	OU
right	.U
now	OU
the	OO
tool	OO
is	OO
the	OO
submarine	,O
the	OO
limiting	OU
factor	.U
it's	OU
a	OO
state	OO
of	OO
the	OO
art	OO
vessel	OO
supported	OO
by	OO
the	OO
support	OO
ship	,O
the	OO
pressure	OU
drop	.U
it	OU
has	OO
a	OO
two	OO
person	OO
titanium	OO
sphere	,O
90	OO
millimeters	OO
thick	,O
that	OO
keeps	OO
it	OO
at	OO
one	OO
atmosphere	,O
and	OO
it	OO
has	OO
the	OO
ability	OO
to	OO
dive	OO
repeatedly	OO
down	OO
to	OO
the	OO
very	OO
deepest	OO
point	OO
of	OO
the	OO
ocean	.O
db:	OU
so	OU
like	OO
the	OO
spacex	OU
of	OO
ocean	OO
exploration	?O
vv:	OU
yeah	,U
it's	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
the	OO
spacex	OU
of	OO
ocean	OO
exploration	,O
but	OO
i	OU
pilot	OO
my	OO
own	OO
vehicles	.O
db:	OU
are	OU
you	OO
going	OO
to	OO
take	OO
elon	OU
or.	?O
vv:	OU
yeah	,U
i	OU
could	OO
take	OO
someone	OO
down	OO
there	.O
so	,U
elon	,U
if	OO
you're	OO
listening	,O
i'll	OU
give	OO
you	OO
a	OO
ride	OO
in	OO
mine	OO
if	OO
you	OO
give	OO
me	OO
a	OO
ride	OO
in	OO
yours	.O
db:	OU
so	OU
tell	OO
us	OO
what	OO
it's	OO
like	OO
down	OO
there	.O
i	OU
mean	,O
we're	OO
talking	OO
about	OO
a	OO
place	OO
where	OO
the	OO
pressure	OO
is	OO
so	OO
intense	OO
that	OO
it's	OO
like	OO
putting	OO
an	OO
eiffel	OU
tower	OU
on	OO
your	OO
toe	.O
vv:	OU
it's	OU
more	OO
than	OO
that	.O
it's	OU
about	OO
16,000	OO
psi	.O
so	OU
the	OO
issue	OO
is	OO
that	OO
we	OO
have	OO
this	OO
titanium	OO
sphere	OO
that	OO
allows	OO
us	OO
to	OO
go	OO
down	OO
to	OO
these	OO
extreme	OO
depths	OO
and	OO
come	OO
up	OO
repeatedly	.O
that's	OU
never	OO
been	OO
done	OO
before	.O
the	OU
challenger	OU
deep	OU
has	OO
been	OO
dived	OO
twice	,O
once	OO
in	OO
1960	OO
and	OO
once	OO
in	OO
2012	OO
by	OO
james	OU
cameron	,U
and	OO
they	OO
went	OO
down	OO
and	OO
came	OO
back	OO
up	OO
and	OO
those	OO
were	OO
experimental	OO
craft	.O
this	OU
is	OO
the	OO
first	OO
commercially	OO
certified	OO
submersible	OO
that	OO
can	OO
go	OO
up	OO
and	OO
down	OO
thousands	OO

times	OO
with	OO
two	OO
people	,O
including	OO
a	OO

we're	OU
very	OO

that	OO
we	OO

not	OO
too	OO
much	OO
freaks	OO
you	OO
out	,O
is	OO
what	OO
i'm	OU
guessing	.O
vv:	OU
well	,U
it's	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
different	OO
to	OO
go	OO
diving	.O
if	OU
you're	OO
claustrophobic	,O
you	OO
do	OO
not	OO
want	OO
to	OO
be	OO
in	OO
the	OO
submarine	.O
we	OU
go	OO
down	OO
quite	OO
a	OO

the	OO
missions	OO
typically	OO
last	OO
eight	OO
to	OO
nine	OO
hours	OO
in	OO
a	OO

it's	OU
very	OO
different	OO
from	OO
the	OO

previously	OO
which	OO
was	OO
mountain	OO
climbing	OO
where	OO
you're	OO
in	OO
open	OO
spaces	,O
the	OO
wind	OO
is	OO
whipping	,O
it's	OO
very	OO
cold	.O
this	OU
is	OO
the	OO
opposite	.O
it's	OU
much	OO
more	OO
technical	.O
it's	OU
much	OO
more	OO
about	OO
precision	OO
in	OO
using	OO
the	OO
instruments	OO
and	OO
troubleshooting	OO
anything	OO
that	OO
can	OO
go	OO
wrong	.O
but	OU
if	OO
something	OO
really	OO
goes	OO
wrong	OO
in	OO
the	OO
submersible	,O
you're	OO
not	OO
going	OO
to	OO
know	OO
it	.O
db:	OU
so	OU
you're	OO
afraid	OO
of	OO
leaks	OO
is	OO
what	OO
you're	OO
saying	.O
vv:	OU
leaks	OU
are	OO
not	OO
good	,O
but	OO
if	OO
it's	OO
a	OO
leak	OO
that's	OO
happening	,O
it's	OO
not	OO
that	OO
bad	OO
because	OO
if	OO
it	OO
was	OO
really	OO
bad	OO
you	OO
wouldn't	OO

it	,O
again	,O

you	OO

fire	OO
in	OO
the	OO

either	,O

it's	OO

a	OO

i	OU
don't	OO
trust	OO
a	OO

a	OO

that	OU

the	OO

an	OO

when	OO

vv:	OU

you	.O

it's	OU

you're	OO

through	OO
it	.O
and	OU
now	OO
the	OO
indian	OU
ocean	,U
as	OO
kelly	OU
mentioned	.O
vv:	OU
yeah	,U
that	OO
was	OO
three	OO
weeks	OO

we	OU
were	OO
fortunate	OO
enough	OO
to	OO

solve	OO
the	OO

me	OO
three	OO
weeks	OO

what	OU
is	OO
the	OO
deepest	OO
point	OO
in	OO
the	OO
indian	OU
ocean	?U
—	OO
no	OO
one	OO
really	OO
knew	.O
there	OU
were	OO
two	OO
candidates	,O
one	OO
off	OO
of	OO
western	OU
australia	OU
and	OO
one	OO
in	OO
the	OO
java	OU
trench	.U
we	OU
have	OO
this	OO
wonderful	OO
ship	OO
with	OO
a	OO
brilliant	OO
sonar	.O
we	OU
mapped	OO
both	OO
of	OO
them	.O
we	OU
sent	OO
landers	OO
down	OO
to	OO
the	OO
bottom	OO
and	OO
verified	.O
it's	OU
actually	OO
in	OO
the	OO
center	OO
portion	OO
of	OO
the	OO
java	OU
trench	,U
which	OO
is	OO
where	OO
no	OO
one	OO
thought	OO
it	OO
was	.O
in	OU
fact	,O
every	OO
time	OO
we've	OO
completed	OO
one	OO
of	OO
our	OO
major	OO
dives	,O
we	OO
have	OO
to	OO
run	OO
off	OO
to	OO
wikipedia	OU
and	OO
change	OO
it	OO
because	OO
it's	OO
completely	OO
wrong	.O
db:	OU
so	OU
it	OO
probably	OO
takes	OO
longer	OO
to	OO
get	OO
down	OO
there	OO
than	OO
the	OO
time	OO
you're	OO
able	OO
to	OO
spend	OO
down	OO
there	?O
vv:	OU
no	,U
we	OO
actually	OO
spend	OO
quite	OO
a	OO
bit	OO
of	OO
time	.O
i	OU
have	OO
four	OO
days	OO
of	OO
oxygen	OO
supply	OO
in	OO
the	OO
vessel	.O
if	OU
i'm	OU
down	OO
there	OO
for	OO
four	OO
days	,O
something's	OO
gone	OO
so	OO
wrong	OO
i'm	OU
probably	OO
not	OO
going	OO
to	OO
use	OO
it	,O
but	OO
it's	OO
about	OO
three	OO
hours	OO
down	OO
to	OO
the	OO
deepest	OO
part	OO
of	OO
the	OO
ocean	OO
and	OO
then	OO
we	OO
can	OO
spend	OO
usually	OO
three	OO
or	OO
four	OO
hours	OO
and	OO
then	OO
another	OO
three	OO
hours	OO
up	.O
so	OU
you	OO
don't	OO
want	OO
to	OO
stay	OO
in	OO
there	OO
for	OO
more	OO
than	OO
10	OO
or	OO
11	OO
hours	.O
it	OU
can	OO
get	OO
a	OO
little	OO
tight	.O
db:	OU
alright	,U
so	OO
the	OO
bottom	OO
of	OO
the	OO
indian	OU
ocean	.U
and	OU
this	OO
is	OO
something	OO
that	OO
no	OO
one	OO
besides	OO
you	OO
has	OO
ever	OO
seen	OO
before	OO
—	OO
vv:	OU
this	OU
is	OO
actually	OO
imagery	OO
from	OO
one	OO
of	OO
our	OO
robotic	OO
landers	.O
on	OU
the	OO
bottom	OO
right	OO
you	OO
can	OO
actually	OO
see	OO
a	OO
robust	OO
assfish	OO
—	OO
that's	OO
what	OO
it's	OO
actually	OO
called	.O
but	OU
you	OO
can	OO
see	OO
from	OO
the	OO
left	OO
a	OO
creature	OO
that's	OO
never	OO
been	OO
seen	OO
before	.O
it's	OU
actually	OO
a	OO
bottom	OO
dwelling	OO
jellyfish	OO
called	OO
a	OO
stalked	OO
ascidian	,O
and	OO
none	OO
of	OO
them	OO
have	OO
ever	OO
looked	OO
like	OO
this	OO
before	.O
it	OU
actually	OO
has	OO
a	OO
small	OO
child	OO
at	OO
the	OO
bottom	OO
of	OO
its	OO
stalk	,O
and	OO
it	OO
just	OO
drifted	OO
across	OO
beautifully	.O
so	OU
every	OO
single	OO
dive	OO
we	OO
have	OO
gone	OO
on	,O
even	OO
though	OO
we're	OO
only	OO
down	OO
there	OO
for	OO
a	OO
couple	OO
of	OO
hours	,O
we	OO
have	OO
found	OO
three	OO
or	OO
four	OO
new	OO
species	OO
because	OO
these	OO
are	OO
places	OO
that	OO
have	OO
been	OO
isolated	OO
for	OO
billions	OO
of	OO
years	OO
and	OO
no	OO
human	OO
being	OO
has	OO
ever	OO
been	OO
down	OO
there	OO
to	OO
film	OO
them	OO
or	OO
take	OO
samples	.O
and	OU
so	OO
this	OO
is	OO
extraordinary	OO
for	OO
us	OO
—	OO
so	OU
what	OO
we	OO
are	OO
hoping	OO
—	OO
the	OO
main	OO
objective	OO
of	OO
our	OO
mission	OO
is	OO
to	OO
build	OO
this	OO

this	OU

a	OO

with	OO
this	OO

we'll	OO
be	OO
able	OO
to	OO
make	OO
more	OO
of	OO
them	OO
potentially	OO
and	OO
take	OO

down	OO
to	OO

thousands	OO

to	OO
open	OO

and	OO
find	OO
things	OO
that	OO
we	OO
had	OO

the	OU

for	OU

there	OO

leading	OO
approaches:	OO

a	OU

quantum	OO

them	OO

the	OU

housed	OO
in	OO
a	OO

made	OO
of	OO

from	OO
the	OO

to	OU
use	OO
a	OO

the	OO

the	OO

what	OO

the	OO

in	OU

the	OO

the	OO

whether	OO

how	OO

an	OU

them	OO
to	OO

the	OO
answer:	OO
3	OO

5	.O
superconducting	OU
qubit	OO
quantum	OO

do	OO
the	OO

in	OO
a	OO
different	OO
way:	OO
using	OO
a	OO

instead	OO
of	OO
an	OO

the	OU

the	OO

they	OU
can	OO
be	OO
manipulated	OO
with	OO

in	OO
the	OO

so:	OU
the	OO

from	OO
either	OO

very	OO
precisely	,O

they	OO
last	OO
a	OO

but	OO
as	OO
more	OO

added	OO
to	OO
a	OO

it	OO
becomes	OO
increasingly	OO
difficult	OO
to	OO

we	OU
can’t	OO
currently	OO
contain	OO
enough	OO

in	OO
a	OO

to	OO

one	OO

to	OO
connect	OO
many	OO

that	OO

rather	OO
than	OO
trying	OO

the	OU

that	OO

how	OO

your	OU

is	OO
simple:	OO
you’ll	OO

the	OO

to	OO
count	OO

and	OO
the	OO

there’s	OO
no	OO

the	OO

you	,U

the	OO

you’re	OO

that	OO

it	OU

the	OO

an	OO

the	OO

so	OO
i	OU

it's	OO

then	OU
there	OO
is	OO
my	OO
mother;	OO
she	OO

a	OO

much	OO
to	OO
my	OO
two	OO

dismay	,O
not	OO
of	OO
the	OO
locomotive	OO
kind	OO
but	OO
very	OO
much	OO
of	OO
the	OO
music	OO
kind	.O
growing	OU
up	,O
i	OU
saw	OO
how	OO
difficult	OO
it	OO
is	OO
to	OO
make	OO
a	OO
living	OO
as	OO
a	OO
musician	OO
in	OO
a	OO
society	OO
where	OO
music	OO
is	OO
universally	OO
loved	OO
but	OO
hopelessly	OO
undervalued	.O
she	OU
works	OO
long	OO

she	OO
still	OO
sacrifices	OO
every	OO
holiday	,O
and	OO
there	OO
is	OO
a	OO
part	OO
of	OO
her	OO
that	OO
never	OO
stops	OO
wondering	OO
what	OO
people	OO
thought	OO
of	OO
her	OO
last	OO
performance	.O
if	OU
you	OO
count	OO
up	OO
all	OO
the	OO
awards	,O
the	OO
recognitions	,O
and	OO
distinctions	,O
she's	OO
by	OO
far	,O
the	OO
most	OO
successful	OO
member	OO
of	OO
our	OO
family	,O
but	OO
she	OO
certainly	OO
wouldn't	OO
think	OO
so	.O
not	OU
that	OO
being	OO
a	OO
doctor	OO
isn't	OO
stressful	OO
it	OO
is	OO
but	OO
at	OO
the	OO
end	OO
of	OO
the	OO
day	,O
you've	OO
spent	OO
your	OO
time	OO
trying	OO
to	OO
extend	OO
or	OO
enhance	OO
a	OO
person's	OO
life	,O
and	OO
who	OO
can	OO
argue	OO
the	OO
value	OO
of	OO
that	?O
so	OU
when	OO
it	OO
was	OO
my	OO
turn	OO
to	OO
decide	OO
what	OO
to	OO
do	OO
with	OO
my	OO
professional	OO
life	,O
the	OO
choice	OO
seemed	OO
pretty	OO
straight	OO
forward:	OO
go	OO
to	OO
medical	OO
school	,O
and	OO
in	OO
your	OO
free	OO
time	,O
continue	OO
up	OO
your	OO
musical	OO
training	.O
but	OU
then	OO
i	OU
watched	OO
my	OO
brother	OO
trained	OO
to	OO
become	OO
an	OO
orthopedic	OO
surgeon	,O
and	OO
i	OU
realized	OO
there	OO
is	OO
no	OO
such	OO
thing	OO
as	OO
free	OO
time	OO
in	OO
med	OO
school	OO
and	OO
especially	OO
in	OO
the	OO
years	OO
that	OO
follow	.O
i	OU
didn't	OO
want	OO
to	OO
give	OO
up	OO
the	OO
most	OO
important	OO
years	OO
of	OO
my	OO
vocal	OO
training	.O
i	OU
also	OO
couldn't	OO
see	OO
how	OO
i	OU
could	OO
support	OO
myself	OO
and	OO
pay	OO
for	OO
those	OO
expensive	OO
singing	OO
lessons	OO
if	OO
i	OU
didn't	OO
have	OO
some	OO
other	OO
way	OO
to	OO
make	OO
money	.O
so	OU
i	OU
turned	OO
to	OO
neuroscience	.O
to	OU
me	,O
it	OO
was	OO
the	OO
a	OO
perfect	OO
blend	OO
of	OO
science	OO
and	OO
poetry	.O
like	OU
pretty	OO
much	OO
every	OO
other	OO
neuroscientist	OO
of	OO
my	OO
generation	,O
i	OU
devoured	OO
the	OO
writings	OO
of	OO
oliver	OU
sacks;	OU
i	OU
studied	OO
topics	OO
like	OO
autobiographical	OO
memory	,O
analogical	OO
reasoning	,O
creativity	.O
so	OU
you'd	OO
think	OO
then	OO
i'd	OU
turn	OO
to	OO
science	OO
to	OO
help	OO
me	OO
become	OO
a	OO
better	OO
musician	.O
after	OU
all	,O
if	OO
i	OU
was	OO
using	OO
science	OO
to	OO
understand	OO
something	OO
as	OO
elusive	OO
as	OO
insight	,O
wouldn't	OO
it	OO
make	OO
sense	OO
to	OO
turn	OO
there	OO
to	OO
learn	OO
the	OO
things	OO
that	OO
i	OU
loved	?O
but	OU
the	OO
truth	OO
is	OO
the	OO
more	OO
i	OU
looked	OO
at	OO
anatomical	OO
drawings	OO
of	OO
the	OO
larynx	,O
the	OO
tongue	,O
and	OO
the	OO
diaphragm	,O
the	OO
less	OO
i	OU
felt	OO
i	OU
understood	OO
about	OO
my	OO
instrument;	OO
i	OU
couldn't	OO
see	OO
how	OO
knowing	OO
what	OO
parts	OO
of	OO
the	OO
brain	OO
were	OO
active	OO
or	OO
even	OO
enhanced	OO
in	OO
musicians	OO
would	OO
make	OO
me	OO
sing	OO
better	.O
for	OU
a	OO
while	,O
i	OU
even	OO
tried	OO
very	OO
hard	OO
to	OO
give	OO
up	OO
singing	,O
because	,O
after	OO
all	,O
there	OO
are	OO
so	OO
many	OO
great	OO
singers	OO
in	OO
the	OO
world	.O
we	OU
all	OO
need	OO
to	OO
get	OO
one	OO
on	OO
one	OO
care	OO
from	OO
a	OO
physician	,O
but	OO
many	OO
hundreds	OO
of	OO
thousands	OO
of	OO
us	OO
can	OO
be	OO
moved	OO
by	OO
the	OO

so	OU
wouldn't	OO
i	,U

maybe	OO
the	OO
world	,O
be	OO
better	OO
off	OO
if	OO
i	OU

the	OU

irritable	,O
a	OO
little	OO
irrational	,O
often	OO
mean;	OO
and	OO
i	OU
found	OO
too	OO
often	OO
i	OU
would	OO
cap	OO
off	OO
a	OO
difficult	OO
day	OO
in	OO
the	OO
lab	OO
with	OO
a	OO
martini	OO
or	OO
two	OO
and	OO
an	OO
hour	OO
of	OO
self	OO
loathing	.O
so	OU
when	OO
i	OU
finished	OO
my	OO
neuroscience	OO
phd	,U
i	OU
decided	OO
to	OO
dedicate	OO
myself	OO
full	OO
time	OO
to	OO
music;	OO
i	OU
enrolled	OO
in	OO
a	OO
master's	OU
of	OO
music	OU
program	.O
classical	OU
musical	OO
training	OO
follows	OO
the	OO
apprenticeship	OO
model	OO
where	OO
you	OO
study	OO
with	OO
one	OO
or	OO
two	OO
teachers	OO
for	OO
many	OO
years	OO
until	OO
you	OO
can	OO
produce	OO
the	OO
sounds	OO
that	OO
you	OO
hear	OO
in	OO
your	OO
imagination	OO
on	OO
your	OO
instrument	.O
but	OU
the	OO
one	OO
thing	OO
that	OO
kept	OO
gnawing	OO
at	OO
me	OO
over	OO
and	OO
over	OO
again	OO
was	OO
how	OO
little	OO
neuroscience	OO
had	OO
trickled	OO
down	OO
into	OO
this	OO
model	.O
after	OU
all	,O
most	OO
of	OO
the	OO
techniques	OO
are	OO
built	OO
upon	OO
performing	OO
the	OO
same	OO
exercises	OO
over	OO
and	OO
over	OO
and	OO
over	OO
again	,O
often	,O
in	OO
the	OO
same	OO
way	,O
everyday;	OO
until	OO
you	OO
build	OO
those	OO
skills	.O
to	OU
demonstrate	OO
this	,O
i	OU
want	OO
to	OO
introduce	OO
to	OO
you	OO
one	OO
of	OO
my	OO
favorite	OO
collaborators	,O
keisuke	OU
nakagoshi	.U
keisuke	OU
is	OO
going	OO
to	OO
give	OO
us	OO
an	OO
example	OO
of	OO
what	OO
a	OO
typical	OO
piano	OO
training	OO
exercise	OO
sounds	OO
like	.O
over	OU
and	OO
over	OO
and	OO
over	OO
again	.O
but	OU
the	OO
truth	OO
is	OO
if	OO
you	OO
want	OO
to	OO
take	OO
what	OO
you're	OO
learning	,O
what	OO
you're	OO
developing	OO
in	OO
that	OO
skill	,O
and	OO
apply	OO
it	OO
to	OO
any	OO
piece	OO
of	OO
music	,O
research	OO
in	OO
motor	OO
learning	OO
suggests	OO
that	OO
you	OO
should	OO
in	OO
fact	OO
interleave	OO
and	OO
space	OO
out	OO
your	OO
trials	OO
introducing	OO
some	OO
randomness	OO
what	OO
we	OO
call	OO
desirable	OO
difficulties	.O
there	OU
is	OO
even	OO
a	OO
study	OO
of	OO
pianists	OO
demonstrating	OO
this	OO
effect	,O
but	OO
so	OO
many	OO
teachers	OO
have	OO
never	OO
heard	OO
of	OO
such	OO
a	OO
thing	.O
so	OU
then	OO
i	OU
began	OO
to	OO
wonder	,O
what	OU
would	OO
happen	OO
if	OO
i	OU
actually	OO
try	OO
it	OO
on	OO
myself	?O
as	OO
most	OO
scientists	OO
use	OO
themselves	OO
as	OO
guinea	OO
pigs	,O
and	OO
i	OU
found	OO
that	OO
i	OU
started	OO
to	OO
improve	OO
much	OO
more	OO
rapidly	.O
so	OU
i	OU
developed	OO
a	OO
course	OO
called	OO
training	OU
the	OO
musical	OU
brain;	OU
how	OO
to	OO
use	OO
neuroscience	OO
to	OO
develop	OO
more	OO
effective	OO
practice	OO
strategies	OO
which	OO
i	OU
now	OO
teach	OO
at	OO
the	OO
conservatory	OU
of	OO
music	OU
here	OO
in	OO
san	OU
francisco	.U
i	OU
started	OO
to	OO
wonder	,O
are	OU
there	OO
other	OO
ways	OO
that	OO
science	OO
can	OO
make	OO
me	OO
a	OO
better	OO
musician	OO
that	OO
i	OU
couldn't	OO
see	OO
ten	OO
years	OO
ago	?O
when	OU
i	OU
was	OO
a	OO
child	,O
i	OU
remember	OO
one	OO
of	OO
my	OO
evaluations	OO
at	OO
the	OO
royal	OU
conservatory	OU
of	OO
music;	OU
it'll	OO
always	OO
stick	OO
with	OO
me	.O
i	OU
was	OO
a	OO
kid	,O
i	OU
sang	OO
all	OO
my	OO
pieces	OO
well	,O
i	OU
didn't	OO
make	OO
any	OO
mistakes	,O
the	OO
judges	OO
said	OO
my	OO
tone	OO
was	OO
very	OO
good	,O
i	OU
had	OO
good	OO
technique	,O
but	OO
my	OO
performance	OO
was	OO
deemed	OO
unmusical	.O
i	OU
was	OO
devastated	.O
how	OU
could	OO
these	OO
judges	OO
gauge	OO
my	OO
musicality	?O
couldn't	OU
they	OO
see	OO
that	OO
i	OU
feel	OO
and	OO
understand	OO
this	OO
music	OO
deeply	?O
but	OU
the	OO
truth	OO
is	OO
feeling	OO
the	OO
music	OO
and	OO
producing	OO
music	OO
other	OO
people	OO
feel	OO
are	OO
two	OO
different	OO
skills	.O
in	OU
the	OO
rehearsal	OO
room	,O
i	OU
can	OO
cry	OO
as	OO
much	OO
as	OO
i	OU
need	OO
to	OO
when	OO
my	OO
character	OO
is	OO
dying	,O
but	OO
when	OO
i	OU
get	OO
on	OO
stage	,O
it's	OO
your	OO
time	OO
to	OO
cry	OO
not	OO
mine	.O
so	OU
what	OO
could	OO
science	OO
tell	OO
me	OO
about	OO
that	?O
that's	OU
when	OO
my	OO
two	OO
worlds	OO
collided;	OO
because	OO
after	OO
all	,O
art	OO
and	OO
science	OO
are	OO
after	OO
the	OO
same	OO
thing:	OO
the	OO
goal	OO
is	OO
to	OO
understand	OO
the	OO
human	OO
experience	.O
science	OU
does	OO
it	OO
by	OO
extracting	OO
general	OO
principles	OO
about	OO
the	OO
world	,O
and	OO
art	OO
uses	OO
individual	OO
experience	OO
to	OO
highlight	OO
what's	OO
universal	.O
so	OU
here	OO
is	OO
what	OO
i	OU
learned	OO
in	OO
a	OO
nutshell:	OO
your	OO
brain	OO
is	OO
primed	OO
to	OO
search	OO
for	OO
meaning	,O
for	OO
patterns	,O
in	OO
a	OO
random	,O
chaotic	OO
world	.O
we	OU
look	OO
for	OO
these	OO
things	OO
everywhere	,O
and	OO
we've	OO
evolved	OO
in	OO
such	OO
a	OO
way	OO
that	OO
it's	OO
enjoyable	OO
when	OO
we	OO
make	OO
a	OO
new	OO
connection	,O
when	OO
we	OO
learn	OO
something	OO
new	,O
when	OO
we	OO
understand	OO
something	OO

we	OU
find	OO
pleasure	OO
in	OO
it	.O
we	OU

things	OO
that	OO

to	OO
us	OO
even	OO
when	OO
they	OO

we	OU

why	?U
because	OU

you	OO
that	OO

that's	OO

a	OU

the	OO
first	OO

that	OO

these	OO

what	OO
it	OO

to	OO
be	OO
musical	.O
even	OU
as	OO
a	OO
master's	OO
student	,O
i	OU

doubted	OO
my	OO

it	OO

a	OO

what	OO

and	OO
how	OO
to	OO
do	OO
it	,O
but	OO
if	OO
you	OO
even	OO
asked	OO
the	OO

it	OO
showed	OO
that	OO
you	OO

cool	.O
i	OU
guess	OO
the	OO
fact	OO
i	OU
turned	OO
to	OO
science	OO
for	OO

the	OO

in	OO
the	OO

of	OO
my	OO

even	OU
though	OO
in	OO
the	OO

i'd	OU
spend	OO
almost	OO
all	OO
my	OO
time	OO
perfecting	OO
my	OO
high	OO
notes	,O
after	OO
all	,O
that's	OO
what	OO
gets	OO
you	OO
hired	.O
they	OU
come	OO
at	OO
the	OO
climax	OO
of	OO
the	OO
piece;	OO
they	OO
get	OO
the	OO
biggest	OO
reaction	OO
from	OO
the	OO
audience;	OO
and	OO
if	OO
you	OO
screw	OO
them	OO
up	,O
they	OO
are	OO
the	OO
most	OO
memorable	.O
but	OU
my	OO
singing	OO
teacher	OO
would	OO
say	OO
to	OO
me	,O
it's	OU
all	OO
the	OO
notes	OO
that	OO
are	OO
leading	OO
up	OO
to	OO
the	OO
high	OO
note	OO
that	OO
are	OO
more	OO
important	OO
than	OO
the	OO
high	OO
note	,O
and	OO
that's	OO
what	OO
you	OO
should	OO
practice	.O
i	OU
understood	OO
that	OO
from	OO
a	OO
technical	OO
perspective	OO
but	OO
not	OO
from	OO
a	OO
musical	OO
one	OO
until	OO
i	OU
read	OO
the	OO
salimpoor	OU
paper	.O
in	OU
the	OO
salimpoor	OU

they	OO
show	OO
that	OO
there	OO

two	OO
regions	OO
of	OO
the	OO

that	OO
mediate	OO
getting	OO
the	OO
chills	OO
from	OO

and	OO
they	OO

in	OO
these	OO
regions	.O
they	OU
are	OO
the	OO
caudate	OO
and	OO
the	OO
nucleus	OO

you	OU
can	OO
think	OO
of	OO
the	OO
caudate	OO
as	OO
your	OO
parent:	OO
it	OO
tells	OO
you	OO
that	OO
your	OO

it	OO
tracks	OO
how	OO
the	OO
things	OO
that	OO
you	OO
see	,O
hear	,O
observe	,O
and	OO
do	OO
have	OO
outcomes;	OO
it	OO
sets	OO
up	OO
the	OO
expectation	OO
of	OO
a	OO
reward	OO
of	OO
pleasure	OO
and	OO
ensures	,O
in	OO
the	OO

you	OO
will	OO
behave	OO
in	OO
such	OO
a	OO
way	OO
that	OO
you	OO
will	OO
seek	OO
reward	OO
and	OO
avoid	OO
the	OO
things	OO
that	OO
led	OO
to	OO
punishment	.O
the	OU
caudate	OO
is	OO
awash	OO
with	OO
dopamine	OO
when	OO
you	OO
are	OO
leading	OO
up	OO
to	OO
the	OO
special	OO
moment	OO
that	OO
will	OO
give	OO
you	OO

when	OO
you	OO
get	OO
to	OO
the	OO

you	OO
the	OO

there	OO
is	OO
a	OO

your	OU
nucleus	OO
accumbens	OO
is	OO
your	OO
bff	,U
it's	OO
your	OO

for	OO

because	OO
more	OO
dopamine	OO
in	OO
the	OO

with	OO
a	OO

in	OU

stuck	OO

into	OO
the	OO

every	OO

those	OU

the	OU
intensity	OO
of	OO
the	OO

that	OO
you	OO

from	OO

depends	OO
on	OO
how	OO

there	OO

your	OO

but	OO
the	OO

or	,O

them	OO
at	OO

depends	OO
on	OO
the	OO
amount	OO
of	OO
dopamine	OO
in	OO
your	OO

that's	OU
what	OO
i	OU
learned	,O
that's	OO
what	OO
it	OO
means	OO
to	OO
be	OO
musical	.O
you	OU
need	OO
to	OO
set	OO
up	OO
the	OO
musical	OO
intention	OO
for	OO
your	OO
audience	OO
so	OO
that	OO
they	OO
will	OO
pay	OO

so	OO
that	OO
the	OO

will	OO
know	OO
that	OO
there	OO
is	OO
a	OO
reward	OO
to	OO
be	OO
had	,O
and	OO
we	OO
better	OO
pay	OO
attention	.O
then	,U
as	OO
a	OO
musician	,O
you	OO
use	OO
all	OO
kinds	OO
of	OO
tools	,O
once	OO
you've	OO
set	OO
up	OO
the	OO
tension	,O
to	OO
delay	OO
it	,O
to	OO
delay	OO
the	OO
release	.O
there's	OU
all	OO

of	OO
music	OO
tools	OO
you	OO
can	OO
use	OO
to	OO
increase	OO
the	OO
desire	,O
the	OO
expectation	,O
the	OO
motivation	OO
for	OO
the	OO

because	,O
after	OO
all	,O
pleasure	OO
is	OO
the	OO

of	OO

but	OU
the	OO
more	OO

there	OO
is	,O
the	OO
better	OO
the	OO

that's	OU
what	OO

to	OO

who	OO

that's	OU

however	,O
we	OO

about	OO

this	OO

a	OO

question	OO
that	OO

many	OO
studies	.O
but	OU
the	OO
first	OO
step	OO
to	OO
uncovering	OO
this	OO
question	OO
is	OO
to	OO
investigate	OO
when	OO
in	OO
development	OO
we	OO
become	OO
sensitive	OO
to	OO
others'	OO
evaluations	.O
i	OU
have	OO
spent	OO
the	OO
past	OO
four	OO
years	OO
at	OO

investigating	OO
how	OO
an	OO
infant	,O
who	OO

no	OO

walking	OO
around	OO
the	OO

into	OO
an	OO
adult	OO
that	OO
fears	OO
public	OO
speaking	OO
for	OO
fear	OO
of	OO
being	OO
negatively	OO
judged	.O
now	,U
this	OO
is	OO
usually	OO
a	OO
point	OO
when	OO
people	OO
ask	OO
me	,O
how	OU
do	OO
you	OO
investigate	OO
this	OO
question	,O
exactly	?O
infants	OU
can't	OO
talk	,O
right	?O
well	,U
if	OO
my	OO
husband	OO
were	OO
up	OO
here	OO
right	OO
now	,O
he	OO
would	OO
tell	OO
you	OO
that	OO

because	OO
he	OO
would	OO
rather	OO

in	OU

i	OU
design	OO

in	OO
the	OO
form	OO
of	OO
games	.O
developmental	OU
psychologist	OO
dr	.U
philippe	OU
rochat	OU
and	OO
i	OU
designed	OO
a	OO
game	OO
called	OO
the	OU
robot	OU
task	OU
to	OO
explore	OO
when	OO
children	OO
would	OO
begin	OO
to	OO
be	OO
sensitive	OO
to	OO
the	OO
evaluation	OO
of	OO
others	.O
specifically	,U
the	OO
robot	OO
task	OO
captures	OO
when	OO
children	,O
like	OO
adults	,O
strategically	OO
modify	OO
their	OO
behavior	OO
when	OO
others	OO
are	OO
watching	.O
to	OU
do	OO
this	,O
we	OO
showed	OO
14	OO
to	OO
24	OO
month	OO
old	OO
infants	OO
how	OO
to	OO
activate	OO
a	OO
toy	OO
robot	,O
and	OO
importantly	,O
we	OO
either	OO
assigned	OO
a	OO
positive	OO
value	,O
saying	OO
wow	,U
isn't	OO
that	OO
great	.O
or	OO
a	OO
negative	OO
value	,O
saying	,O
oh	,U
oh	.O
oops	,U
oh	OO
no	,O
after	OO
pressing	OO
the	OO
remote	.O
following	OU
this	OO
toy	OO
demonstration	,O
we	OO
invited	OO
the	OO
infants	OO
to	OO
play	OO
with	OO
the	OO
remote	,O
and	OO
then	OO
either	OO
watched	OO
them	OO
or	OO
turned	OO
around	OO
and	OO
pretended	OO
to	OO
read	OO
a	OO
magazine	.O
the	OU
idea	OO
was	OO
that	OO
if	OO
by	OO
24	OO
months	,O
children	OO
are	OO
indeed	OO
sensitive	OO
to	OO
the	OO
evaluation	OO
of	OO
others	,O
then	OO
their	OO
button	OO
pressing	OO
behavior	OO
should	OO
be	OO
influenced	OO
not	OO
only	OO
by	OO
whether	OO
or	OO
not	OO
they're	OO
being	OO
watched	OO
but	OO
also	OO
by	OO
the	OO
values	OO
that	OO
the	OO
experimenter	OO
expressed	OO
towards	OO
pressing	OO
the	OO
remote	.O
so	OU
for	OO
example	,O
we	OO
would	OO
expect	OO
children	OO
to	OO
play	OO
with	OO
the	OO
positive	OO
remote	OO
significantly	OO
more	OO
if	OO
they	OO
were	OO
being	OO
observed	OO
but	OO
then	OO
choose	OO
to	OO
explore	OO
the	OO
negative	OO
remote	OO
once	OO
no	OO
one	OO
was	OO
watching	.O
to	OU
really	OO
capture	OO
this	OO
phenomenon	,O
we	OO
did	OO
three	OO
variations	OO
of	OO
the	OO
study	.O
study	OU
one	OO
explored	OO
how	OO
infants	OO
would	OO
engage	OO
with	OO
a	OO
novel	OO
toy	OO
if	OO
there	OO
were	OO
no	OO
values	OO
or	OO
instructions	OO
provided	.O
so	OU
we	OO
simply	OO
showed	OO
infants	OO
how	OO
to	OO
activate	OO
the	OO
toy	OO
robot	,O
but	OO
didn't	OO
assign	OO
any	OO
values	,O
and	OO
we	OO
also	OO
didn't	OO
tell	OO
them	OO
that	OO
they	OO
could	OO
play	OO
with	OO
the	OO
remote	,O
providing	OO
them	OO
with	OO
a	OO
really	OO
ambiguous	OO
situation	.O
in	OU
study	OO
two	,O
we	OO
incorporated	OO
the	OO
two	OO
values	,O
a	OO
positive	OO
and	OO
a	OO
negative	.O
and	OU
in	OO
the	OO
last	OO
study	,O
we	OO
had	OO
two	OO
experimenters	OO
and	OO
one	OO
remote	.O
one	OU
experimenter	OO
expressed	OO
a	OO
negative	OO
value	OO
towards	OO
pressing	OO
the	OO
remote	,O
saying	,O
yuck	,U
the	OO
toy	OO
moved	,O
while	OO
the	OO
other	OO
experimenter	OO
expressed	OO
a	OO
positive	OO
value	,O
saying	,O
yay	,U
the	OO
toy	OO
moved	.O
and	OU
this	OO
is	OO
how	OO
the	OO
children	OO
reacted	OO
to	OO
these	OO
three	OO
different	OO
scenarios	.O
so	OU
in	OO
study	OO
one	,O
the	OO
ambiguous	OO
situation	,O
i'm	OU
currently	OO
watching	OO
the	OO
child	.O
she	OU
doesn't	OO
seem	OO
to	OO
be	OO
too	OO
interested	OO
in	OO
pressing	OO
the	OO
remote	.O
once	OU
i	OU
turned	OO
around	OO
—	OO
now	OO
she's	OO
ready	OO
to	OO
play	.O
currently	,U
i'm	OU
not	OO
watching	OO
the	OO
child	.O
she's	OU
really	OO
focused	.O
i	OU
turn	OO
around	.O
she	OU
wasn't	OO
doing	OO
anything	,O
right	?O
in	OU
study	OO
two	,O
it's	OO
the	OO
two	OO
remotes	,O
one	OO
with	OO
the	OO
positive	OO
and	OO
one	OO
with	OO
the	OO
negative	OO
value	.O
i'm	OU
currently	OO
observing	OO
the	OO
child	.O
and	OU
the	OO
orange	OO
remote	OO
is	OO
a	OO
negative	OO
remote	.O
she's	OU
just	OO
looking	OO
around	,O
looking	OO
at	OO
me	,O
hanging	OO
out	.O
then	OU
i	OU
turn	OO
around	.O
that's	OU
what	OO
she's	OO
going	OO
for	.O
i'm	OU
not	OO
watching	OO
the	OO
child	.O
he	OU
wants	OO
the	OO
mom	OO
to	OO
play	OO
with	OO
it	,O
right	?O
take	OU
a	OO
safer	OO
route	.O
i	OU
turn	OO
around	.O
he	OU
wasn't	OO
doing	OO
anything	,O
either	.O
yeah	,U
he	OO
feels	OO
awkward	.O
everyone	OU
knows	OO
that	OO
side	OO
eyed	OO
glance	,O
right	?O
study	OU
three	,O
the	OO
two	OO
experimenters	,O
one	OO
remote	.O
the	OU
experimenter	OO
that	OO
reacted	OO
negatively	OO
towards	OO
pressing	OO
the	OO
remote	OO
is	OO
watching	OO
the	OO
child	OO
right	OO
now	.O
she	OU
feels	OO
a	OO
little	OO
awkward	,O
doesn't	OO
know	OO
what	OO
to	OO
do	,O
relying	OO
on	OO
mom	.U
and	OU
then	,O
she's	OO
going	OO
to	OO
turn	OO
around	OO
so	OO
that	OO
the	OO
experimenter	OO
that	OO
expressed	OO
a	OO
positive	OO
response	OO
is	OO
watching	.O
coast	OU
is	OO
clear	OO
—	OO
now	OO
she's	OO
ready	OO
to	OO
play	.O
so	,U
as	OO
the	OO
data	OO
suggests	,O
we	OO
found	OO
that	OO
children's	OO
button	OO
pressing	OO
behavior	OO
was	OO
indeed	OO
influenced	OO
by	OO
the	OO
values	OO
and	OO
the	OO
instructions	OO
of	OO
the	OO
experimenter	.O
because	OU
in	OO
study	OO
one	,O
children	OO
did	OO
not	OO
know	OO
what	OO
would	OO
be	OO
positively	OO
or	OO
negatively	OO
evaluated	,O
they	OO
tended	OO
to	OO
take	OO
the	OO
safest	OO
route	OO
and	OO
wait	OO
until	OO
i	OU
turned	OO
my	OO
back	OO
to	OO
press	OO
the	OO
remote	.O
children	OU
in	OO
study	OO
two	OO
chose	OO
to	OO
press	OO
the	OO
positive	OO
remote	OO
significantly	OO
more	OO
when	OO
i	OU
was	OO
watching	,O
but	OO
then	OO
once	OO
i	OU
turned	OO
my	OO
back	,O
they	OO
immediately	OO
took	OO
the	OO
negative	OO
remote	OO
and	OO
started	OO
playing	OO
with	OO
it	.O
importantly	,U
in	OO
a	OO
control	OO
study	,O
where	OO
we	OO
removed	OO
the	OO
different	OO
values	OO
of	OO
the	OO
remotes	OO
—	OO
so	OO
we	OO
simply	OO
said	,O
oh	,U
wow	OO
after	OO
pressing	OO
either	OO
of	OO
the	OO
remotes	OO
—	OO
children's	OO
button	OO
pressing	OO
behavior	OO
no	OO
longer	OO
differed	OO
across	OO
conditions	,O
suggesting	OO
that	OO
it	OO
was	OO
really	OO
the	OO
values	OO
that	OO
we	OO
gave	OO
the	OO
two	OO
remotes	OO
that	OO
drove	OO
the	OO
behavior	OO
in	OO
the	OO
previous	OO
study	.O
last	OU
but	OO
not	OO
least	,O
children	OO
in	OO
study	OO
three	OO
chose	OO
to	OO
press	OO
a	OO
remote	OO
significantly	OO
more	OO
when	OO
the	OO
experimenter	OO
that	OO
expressed	OO
a	OO
positive	OO
value	OO
was	OO
watching	,O
as	OO
opposed	OO
to	OO
the	OO
experimenter	OO
that	OO
had	OO
expressed	OO
a	OO
negative	OO
value	.O
not	OU
coincidentally	,O
it	OO
is	OO
also	OO
around	OO
this	OO
age	OO
that	OO
children	OO
begin	OO
to	OO
show	OO
embarrassment	OO
in	OO
situations	OO
that	OO
might	OO
elicit	OO
a	OO
negative	OO
evaluation	,O
such	OO
as	OO
looking	OO
at	OO
themselves	OO
in	OO
the	OO
mirror	OO
and	OO
noticing	OO
a	OO
mark	OO
on	OO
their	OO
nose	.O
the	OU
equivalent	OO
of	OO
finding	OO
spinach	OO
in	OO
your	OO
teeth	,O
for	OO
adults	.O
so	OU
what	OO
can	OO
we	OO
say	,O
based	OO
on	OO
these	OO
findings	?O
besides	OU
the	OO
fact	OO
that	OO
babies	OO
are	OO
actually	OO
really	,O
really	OO
sneaky	.O
from	OU
very	OO
early	OO
on	,O
children	,O
like	OO
adults	,O
are	OO
sensitive	OO
to	OO
the	OO
values	OO
that	OO
we	OO
place	OO
on	OO
objects	OO
and	OO
behaviors	.O
and	OU
importantly	,O
they	OO
use	OO
these	OO
values	OO
to	OO
guide	OO
their	OO
behavior	.O
whether	OU
we're	OO
aware	OO
of	OO
it	OO
or	OO
not	,O
we're	OO
constantly	OO
communicating	OO
values	OO
to	OO
those	OO
around	OO
us	.O
now	,U
i	OU
don't	OO
mean	OO
values	OO

or	OO
don't	OO

although	OO
those	OO
are	OO

values	.O
i	OU

that	OO
we	OO
are	OO
constantly	OO
showing	OO

specifically	OO
our	OO
children	,O
what	OO
is	OO
likeable	,O

and	OO
what	OO

and	OU
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
the	OO
times	,O
we	OO
actually	OO
do	OO
this	OO
without	OO
even	OO
noticing	OO
it	.O
psychologists	OU
study	OO
behavior	OO
to	OO
explore	OO
the	OO
contents	OO
of	OO
the	OO
mind	,O
because	OO
our	OO
behavior	OO
often	OO
reflects	OO
our	OO
beliefs	,O
our	OO
values	OO
and	OO
our	OO
desires	.O
here	OU
in	OO
atlanta	,U
we	OO
all	OO
believe	OO
the	OO
same	OO
thing	.O
that	OU
coke	OU
is	OO
better	OO
than	OO
pepsi	.U
now	,U
this	OO
might	OO
have	OO
to	OO
do	OO
with	OO
the	OO
fact	OO
that	OO
coke	OU
was	OO
invented	OO
in	OO
atlanta	.U
but	OU
regardless	,O
this	OO
belief	OO
is	OO
expressed	OO
in	OO
the	OO
fact	OO
that	OO
most	OO

will	OO

to	OO

coke	.U
in	OU
the	OO

way	,O
we	OO
are	OO

a	OO

when	OO
we	OO
mostly	OO

and	OU
in	OO

up	OO
shaping	OO
their	OO

behavior	.O
the	OU
research	OO
i	OU

shared	OO
with	OO
you	OO
today	OO
suggests	OO
that	OO
this	OO
ability	OO
emerges	OO
very	OO
early	OO
in	OO
development	,O
before	OO
we	OO
can	OO
even	OO
utter	OO
a	OO
complete	OO

or	OO
are	OO
even	OO
potty	OO
trained	.O
and	OU
it	OO
becomes	OO
an	OO
integral	OO
part	OO
of	OO
who	OO
we	OO
grow	OO
up	OO
to	OO
be	.O
so	OU
before	OO
i	OU

i'd	OU
like	OO
to	OO
invite	OO
you	OO
to	OO
contemplate	OO
on	OO
the	OO
values	OO
that	OO
we	OO

how	OO
these	OO
values	OO
might	OO
be	OO
shaping	OO
the	OO
behavior	OO
of	OO
those	OO
around	OO
you	.O
for	OU

what	OO
value	OO
is	OO
being	OO
broadcasted	OO
when	OO
we	OO
spend	OO
more	OO
time	OO
smiling	OO
at	OO
our	OO
phone	OO
than	OO
smiling	OO
with	OO
other	OO
people	?O
likewise	,U
consider	OO
how	OO

been	OO
shaped	OO
by	OO
those	OO
around	OO
you	,O
in	OO

before	.O
to	OU
go	OO
back	OO
to	OO
our	OO
simple	OO
illustration	,O
do	OO
you	OO

prefer	OO
coke	OU
over	OO
pepsi	?U
or	OU
was	OO
this	OO

what	OO

the	OO

an	OO
idea	?O
can	OU
a	OO
simple	OO
idea	OO
work	OO
within	OO
a	OO
very	OO
motivating	OO
context	?O
here	OU
i	OU
have	OO
a	OO
piano	.O
and	OU
within	OO
music	OO
there	OO
are	OO
ideas	.O
for	OU

if	OO
i	OU
play	OO
this	,O
i	OU
can	OO
see	OO
ladies	OO
in	OO
the	OO
audience	OO
sighing	OO
because	OO
it	OO
is	OO
a	OO
wonderful	OO
idea	.O
who	OU
doesn't	OO
know	OO
beethoven's	OU
'fur	OO
elise'	?U
now	,U
this	OO
idea	OO
needs	OO
a	OO
context	.O
on	OU
the	OO
piano	,O
the	OO
context	OO
is	OO
played	OO
by	OO
the	OO
left	OO
hand	.O
the	OU
left	OO
hand	OO
plays	OO
this	.O
perfect	.U
i	OU
have	OO
an	OO
idea	OO
and	OO
a	OO
context	.O
then	,U
i	OU
just	OO
have	OO
to	OO
put	OO
them	OO
together	,O
so	OU
it	OO
sounds	OO
like	OO
this	.O
something	OU
is	OO
wrong	.O
you	OU
may	OO
notice	OO
that	OO
this	OO
can't	OO
be	OO
beethoven	.U
it	OU
is	OO
wrong	OO
because	OO
the	OO
melody	,O
the	OO
idea	,O
is	OO
in	OO
one	OO
tone	OO
but	OO
the	OO
context	OO
is	OO
in	OO
another	.O
this	OU
happens	OO
often	OO
in	OO
real	OO
life	OO
too	.O
you	OU
feel	OO
like	OO
you	OO
have	OO
an	OO
idea	OO
but	OO
the	OO
context	OO
is	OO
in	OO
a	OO
different	OO
tone	.O
if	OU
i	OU
take	OO
the	OO
context	OO
and	OO
do	OO
this	.O
i	OU
change	OO
it	OO
and	OO
i	OU
put	OO
it	OO
in	OO
the	OO
same	OO
frequency	OO
and	OO
tone	OO
as	OO
the	OO
idea	.O
then	,U
everything	OO
starts	OO
to	OO
work	.O
but	OU
this	OO
example	OO
is	OO
easy	,O
if	OO
the	OO
idea	OO
is	OO
as	OO
wonderful	OO
as	OO
beethoven's	OU
idea	.O
but	OU
imagine	OO
that	OO
a	OO
boy	OO
says	OO
to	OO
me	OO
hi	OU
fefe	OU
—	OO
they	OO
call	OO
me	OO
fefe	,U
i	OU
don't	OO

why	.O
hi	OU
fefe	.U
i	OU
want	OO
to	OO
be	OO
a	OO
composer	OO
and	OO
i	OU
have	OO
composed	OO
my	OO
first	OO
piece	,O
this	OO

the	OO
idea	OO
i	OU
have	.O
and	OU
i	OU
say	,O
yes	,U
yes	,O
very	OO
nice	.O
it	OU
reminds	OO
me	OO
of	OO
the	OO
story	OO
of	OO
the	OO
father	OO
that	OO
makes	OO
his	OO
son	OO
study	OO
violin	OO
and	OO
takes	OO
him	OO
to	OO
a	OO
friend	OO
and	OO
says:	OO
look	,U
juan	,U
listen	OO
how	OO
my	OO
son	OO
plays	OO
the	OO
violin	.O
the	OU
son	OO
plays	OO
the	OO
violin	.O
very	OO
badly	.O
and	OU
he	OO
says:	OO
what	OO
do	OO
you	OO
think	OO
about	OO
the	OO
execution	?O
well	,U
executing	OO
him	OO
is	OO
excessive	,O
a	OO
couple	OO
of	OO
slaps	OO
would	OO
be	OO
enough	.O
but	,U
that	OO
wasn't	OO
the	OO
case	.O
without	OU
going	OO
that	OO
far	OO
it	OO
occurred	OO
to	OO
me	OO
to	OO
say	OO
if	OU
this	OO
is	OO
your	OO
idea	.O
you'd	OO
better	OO
do	OO
something	OO
else	,O
son	.O
but	,U
if	OO
that	OO
child	OO
was	OO
frédéric	OU
chopin	,U
a	OO
polish	OU
composer	OO
of	OO
the	OO
nineteenth	OO
century	,O
he	OO
could	OO
have	OO
written	OO
and	OU
with	OO
this	OO
very	OO
simple	OO
idea	,O
which	OO
could	OO
deserve	OO
a	OO
slap	,O
he	OO
composed	OO
a	OO
prelude	,O
prelude	OU
in	OO
e	OU
minor	OU
a	OO
wonderful	OO
piece	OO
that	OO
is	OO
played	OO
in	OO
piano	OO
recitals	OO
everywhere	.O
so	OU
we	OO
had	OO
these	OO
two	OO
examples	.O

what	OO
happens	OO
if	OO

an	OO
idea	,O

what	OU
do	OO
you	OO
think	?O
i	OU
hear	OO
laughs	.O
but	OU
be	OO
careful	,O
because	OO
laughter	OO
can	OO
be	OO
disrespectful	OO
because	OO
this	OO
note	,O
this	OO

be	OO
repeated	.O

it	OU

to	OO

i	OU

the	OO
rhythm	OO
—	OO
rhythm	OO

the	OO

i	OU

for	OO

a	OO
brazilian	OU
composer	,O
i	OU
can	OO
do	OO
this	.O
this	OU
is	OO
one	OU
note	OO
samba	.U
you	OO
may	OO
have	OO
noticed	OO
why	OO
it's	OO
called	OO
that	.O
now	,U
this	OO
one	OO
note	OO
samba	OO
makes	OO
the	OO
most	OO
of	OO
the	OO
idea	OO
of	OO

idea	OO
the	OO
redundancy	OO

intended	OO
reduced	OO
to	OO
the	OO

of	OO
a	OO

note	.O
but	,U

of	OO

ideas	,O
there	OO
is	OO
one	OO

which	OO
is	OO
pretty	OO
average	.O
the	OU
most	OO
interesting	OO
example	OO
of	OO
synthesizing	OO
an	OO
idea	OO
was	OO
invented	OO
by	OO
john	OU

who	OO
composed	OO
a	OO
piece	OO
for	OO

called	OO
4	OO
minutes	OU
33	OO
seconds	.U
and	OU
in	OO
this	OO
case	,O
to	OO
be	OO
faithful	OO
to	OO
the	OO
piece	,O
i'm	OU
going	OO
to	OO
use	OO
a	OO
score	OO
if	OO
you	OO
don't	OO
mind	.O
and	OU
i'm	OU
going	OO
to	OO
play	OO
just	OO
a	OO
fragment	,O
because	,O
you	OO

time	OO

we	OU
could	OO
keep	OO
going	,O
but	OO
i	OU

you	OO

the	OO
picture	.O
there	OU
must	OO
be	,O
perhaps	,O
a	OO
more	OO
intense	OO
version	OO
somewhere	,O

it's	OO
less	OO
interesting	OO
for	OO
an	OO
orchestra	.O
you	OU
can	OO
listen	OO
to	OO
it	OO
if	OO
you	OO
want	.O
and	,U

of	OO
ideas	OO
in	OO

i'm	OU
thinking	,O
to	OO
what	OO

an	OO
idea	OO
our	OO

our	OO

and	OU
when	OO

an	OO
idea	OO

there	OU
is	OO
an	OO
aria	OO
by	OO
mozart	OU
from	OO
the	OO
don	OU
giovanni	OU
opera	OO
—don	OO

it's	OO
the	OO
story	OO
of	OO
a	OO

is	OO
a	OO
womanizer	OO
and	OO
even	OO
though	OO
he	OO

where	OO

'el	OO

it's	OU
very	OO
similar	OO
to	OO
that	OO

now	,U
this	OO

less	OO
clear	OO
because	OO

a	OU
composer	,O
we	OO

this	OU

a	OO
euphemism	OO
for	OO

this	OU
composer	,O
let's	OO
say	OO
he	OO

a	OO
popular	OO
composer	,O
ran	OO
out	OO
of	OO
inspiration	.O
he	OU
didn't	OO
show	OO
inspiration	OO
in	OO

either	,O
but	OO
in	OO
this	OO

he	OO
wanted	OO
inspiration	,O

he	OO
searched	OO
his	OO
old	OO
jukebox	OO

his	OO
old	OO
vinyl	OO
discs	.O
to	OU
the	OO

among	OO

then	,O
we	OO

we	OU
had	OO
vinyl	OO
discs	,O
you	OO

and	OU
he	OO
played	OO
this	OO
vinyl	OO
disc	OO
in	OO

for	OO
inspiration;	OO
it	OO
was	OO
a	OO
tango	.O
it	OU
was	OO
broken	.O
it	OU
didn't	OO
work	.O
so	OU
he	OO
threw	OO
it	OO
away	OO

he	OO
read	OO
on	OO
the	OO

muzio	OU
clementi	,U

who	OU

muzio	OU
clementi	?U
well	,U
muzio	OU
clementi	OU
was	OO
a	OO
great	OO
composer	.O
he	OU
was	OO
much	OO
less	OO
famous	OO
than	OO
his	OO
genius	OO
deserved	.O
he	OU
was	OO
beethoven's	OU
teacher	,O
among	OO
others	.O
and	OU
in	OO
the	OO
third	OO
movement	OO
of	OO
that	OO
sonata	OO
the	OO
one	OO
that	OO
the	OO
composer	OO
was	OO
using	OO
for	OO
inspiration	OO
he	OO
wrote	OO
this	.O
but	OU
the	OO
composer	OO
thought:	OO
i	OU
don't	OO
like	OO
this	.O
something	OU
is	OO
wrong	.O
and	,U
what	OO
is	OO
this	OO

for	?O
there	OU

78	.O

what	OO

i	OU
have	OO
a	OO
hit	.O
and	OU
who	,O
who's	OO

to	OO

the	OO

some	OU

the	OO

the	OO

for	OO

that	OO

why	OO

we	OU

him	OO

it	OO
very	OO
well	,O
and	OO
make	OO
a	OO

we	OO

a	OU

for	OO

you	OO

you	OU

to	OO

you	OO
something	OO
that	OO
i	OU

if	OU
the	OO

it	.O
let's	OU

max	?U
could	OU
you	OO
give	OO
me	OO
a	OO

what	?U
give	OU
me	OO
a	OO
word	OO
for	OO
a	OO

we	OU
are	OO
creating	OO
a	OO
hit	OO
here	.O
so	OU
you	OO
were	.O
i	OU
was	OO
playing	OO
the	OO

give	OU
me	OO
something	OO
to	OO

a	OO

one	OO

this	OU

ambition	OU
that's	OU
it:	OO

ambition	OU
to	OO
love	OO
you	,O
to	OO

you	OO

for	OO
whatever	OO
you	OO

so	,U
let's	OO
do	OO
something	.O
you	OU
remember	OO
the	OO
idea	,O
right	?O
let's	OU
see	OO
if	OO
we	OO
can	OO
sing	OO
this	.O
please	OU
sing	OO
ambition	OU
in	OO
these	OO
three	OO

ambition	.U
we	OU
have	OO
a	OO
problem	OO
here	.O
let's	OU

breathe	OU
properly	,O
let's	OO
do	OO
it	OO
again	.O
ambition	.U
again	.U
ambition	.U
great	.U
i'm	OU
going	OO
to	OO
fill	OO
in	OO
the	OO
gaps	OO
but	OO
when	OO
the	OO
theme	OO
comes	OO
back	OO
we'll	OO
sing	OO
it	OO
loudly	.O
ready	?U
let's	OU
go	.O
we	OU
begin	OO
with	OO
ambition	OU
ambition	.U
stop	,U
stop	,O
stop	.O
now	OU
go	.O
right	OU
now	.O
ambition	.U
louder	,U
louder	.O
ambition	.U
and	.U
ambition	.U
and	OU
to	OO
make	OO
it	OO
a	OO
real	OO
hit	,O
it	OO
needs	OO
to	OO
end	OO
with	OO
an	OO
ovation	OO
because	,O
people	OO
will	OO
think	.O
we're	OU
recording	OO
this	OO
live	,O
right	OO
now	,O
so	OO
you	OO

buy	OO
it	OO
at	OO
the	OO

you	OO

it	.O
so	,U
over	OO

let's	OU
do	OO
a	OO

of	OO
the	OO

this	.O
everyone	OU
over	OO
there	.O
more	,U
more	,O
right	OO
at	OO

great	.U
very	OU
good	.O
you'll	OU
do	OO
that	.O
and	OU
you	OO
begin	OO
to	OO
sing	,O
as	OO
the	OO
applause	OO
grows	OO
you	OO
stop	OO
singing	OO
and	OO

and	OU
that's	OO
how	OO
we	OO
finish	OO
this	OO
tedxríodelaplata	.U
let's	OU
see	OO
how	OO
it	OO
goes	,O
eh	?O
everybody	OU
sing	,O
okay	?O
when	OU
i	OU
give	OO
the	OO
signal	,O
we	OO
give	OO
an	OO

we	OU
are	OO

this	,O
so	,O
be	OO
serious	.O
and	.U
three	.O
ambition	.U
ambition	.U
ambition	.U
ambition	.U
what	OU
if	,O
what	OO
if	OO
a	OO
large	OO
number	OO
of	OO
scientific	OO

that	OO
there	OO
was	OO
one	OO

that	OO

us	OO

and	OO
help	OO
our	OO

to	OO
be	OO

into	OO

what	OU
if	OO
that	OO
activity	,O
while	OO
beneficial	OO
if	OO
undertaken	OO
at	OO
any	OO
time	OO
during	OO
our	OO
lives	,O
was	OO
actually	OO
found	OO
by	OO
the	OO
scientists	OO
to	OO
be	OO
most	OO
beneficial	OO
if	OO
it	OO
was	OO
undertaken	OO
before	OO
the	OO
age	OO
of	OO
seven	?O
what	OU
if	OO
that	OO
activity	,O
unlike	OO
the	OO
momentary	OO
pain	OO
of	OO
a	OO
vaccination	OO
needle	,O
is	OO
actually	OO
enjoyable	OO
for	OO
everyone	OO
involved	?O
now	,U
you	OO
might	OO
be	OO
expecting	OO
me	OO
to	OO
reveal	OO
a	OO
new	OO
superfood	OO
we	OO
could	OO
eat	OO
some	OO
more	OO
of	,O
maybe	OO
a	OO
pill	OO
we	OO
could	OO
take	OO
every	OO
day	OO
or	OO
an	OO
exercise	OO
regimen	OO
we	OO
could	OO
start	,O
but	OU
actually	,O
this	OO
activity	OO
is	OO
as	OO
old	OO
as	OO
our	OO
cultures	OO
and	OO
societies	OO
itself	.O
and	OU
that	OO
activity	OO
is	OO
music	OO
education	.O
now	,U
i	OU
may	OO
well	OO
be	OO
biased	.O
i	OU
am	OO
a	OO
music	OO
educator	,O
and	OO
i	OU
understand	OO
the	OO
world	OO
through	OO
the	OO
twin	OO
lenses	OO
of	OO
being	OO
a	OO
musician	OO
and	OO
being	OO
a	OO
teacher	.O
but	OU
even	OO
before	OO
i	OU
became	OO
a	OO
teacher	,O
i	OU
used	OO
to	OO
look	OO
around	OO
at	OO
all	OO
the	OO
people	OO
i	OU
was	OO
doing	OO
musical	OO
activities	OO
with	OO
and	OO
i	OU
used	OO
to	OO
wonder	OO
why	OO
they	OO
seemed	OO
to	OO
be	OO
good	OO
at	OO
everything	,O
why	OO
they	OO
seem	OO
to	OO
do	OO
well	OO
at	OO
all	OO
of	OO
their	OO
studies	,O
why	OO
they	OO
fit	OO
more	OO
into	OO
a	OO
day	.O
and	OU
while	OO
many	OO
of	OO
them	,O
most	OO
of	OO
them	,O
never	OO
went	OO
on	OO
to	OO
be	OO
musicians	OO
in	OO
their	OO
professional	OO
lives	,O
the	OO
careers	OO
they	OO
did	OO
choose	OO
were	OO
incredibly	OO
diverse	OO
and	OO
they	OO
were	OO
so	OO
successful	OO
in	OO
them	.O
and	OO
they	OO
continue	OO
to	OO
be	OO
so	.O
what	,U
if	OO
anything	,O
did	OO
music	OO
education	OO
have	OO
to	OO
do	OO
with	OO
that	?O
so	OU
when	OO
it	OO
came	OO
time	OO
for	OO
me	OO
to	OO
choose	OO
a	OO
topic	OO
for	OO
my	OO
phd	OU
study	,O
it	OO
became	OO
pretty	OO
clear	OO
pretty	OO
quickly	,O
i	OU
wanted	OO
to	OO
know	OO
if	OO
music	OO
education	OO
benefited	OO
brain	OO
development	.O
what	OU
i	OU
found	OO
was	OO
a	OO
huge	OO
amount	OO
of	OO
research	,O
now	OO
two	OO
decades	OO
worth	,O
conducted	OO
by	OO
neuroscientists	.O
and	OU
the	OO
neuroscientists	OO
had	OO
stumbled	OO
on	OO
something	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
by	OO
accident	.O
they	OU
were	OO
looking	OO
at	OO
the	OO
brain	OO
functions	OO
and	OO
structures	OO
of	OO
musicians	,O
and	,O
literally	,O
their	OO
brains	OO
looked	OO
different	OO
and	OO
they	OO
function	OO
differently	OO
and	OO
in	OO
many	OO
cases	,O
far	OO
more	OO
effectively	.O
so	OU
the	OO
neuroscientists	OO
started	OO
to	OO
do	OO
experiments	OO
that	OO
compared	OO
groups	OO
of	OO
musicians	OO
with	OO
groups	OO
of	OO
non	OO
musicians	OO
doing	OO
all	OO
manner	OO
of	OO
tasks	.O
now	,U
it's	OO
important	OO
at	OO
this	OO
point	OO
to	OO
share	OO
the	OO
definition	OO
of	OO
musician	OO
that	OO
the	OO
neuroscientists	OO
use	.O
they	OU
believe	OO
it	OO
was	OO
someone	OO
who	OO
learnt	OO
a	OO
musical	OO
instrument	OO
and	OO
had	OO
learnt	OO
it	OO
formally	,O
meaning	OO
they'd	OO
had	OO
lessons	OO
from	OO
an	OO
expert	OO
every	OO
week	.O
they'd	OU
learnt	OO
how	OO
to	OO
read	OO
music	,O
most	OO
of	OO
them	OO
had	OO
been	OO
involved	OO
in	OO
ensemble	OO
music	OO
making	OO
experiences	,O
and	OO
they'd	OO
done	OO
it	OO
for	OO
a	OO
reasonably	OO
long	OO
period	OO
of	OO
time	,O
two	OO
years	OO
at	OO
the	OO
very	OO
least	.O
now	,U
to	OO
help	OO
me	OO
explain	OO
some	OO
of	OO
this	OO
research	,O
i'm	OU
going	OO
to	OO
use	,O
i	OU
hope	OO
there	OU
we	OO
go	.O
thank	OU
you	.O
i'm	OU
going	OO
to	OO
use	OO
some	OO
animation	OO
from	OO
a	OO
ted	OU
education	OU
film	OO
that	OO
i	OU
wrote	OO
and	OO
i	OU
helped	OO
to	OO
create	OO
earlier	OO
this	OO
year	.O
now	,U
the	OO
technology	OO
that	OO
helped	OO
the	OO
neuroscientists	OO
allow	OO
them	OO
to	OO
see	OO
our	OO
brains	OO
working	OO
in	OO
real	OO
time	.O
and	OU
what	OO
they	OO
did	OO
is	OO
they	OO
used	OO
fmri	OO
machines	OO
and	OO
pet	OU
scanners	OO
to	OO
watch	OO
what	OO
was	OO
happening	.O
they	OU
would	OO
get	OO
the	OO
participants	OO
to	OO
do	OO
all	OO
sorts	OO
of	OO
tasks	OO
reading	,O
maths	OO
problems	OO
and	OO
they	OO
would	OO
see	OO
certain	OO
areas	OO
of	OO
the	OO
brain	OO
light	OO
up	.O
but	OU
when	OO
they	OO
asked	OO
the	OO
participants	OO
to	OO
listen	OO
to	OO
music	,O
they	OO
saw	OO
fireworks	.O
they	OU
had	OO
never	OO
seen	OO
so	OO
many	OO
areas	OO
of	OO
the	OO
brain	OO
light	OO
up	OO
at	OO
the	OO
same	OO
time	.O
so	OU
why	OO
did	OO
music	OO
education	OO
have	OO
this	OO
impact	OO
on	OO
the	OO
brain	?O
well	,U
what	OO
they	OO
found	OO
is	OO
that	OO
music	OO
education	OO
works	OO
three	OO
areas	OO
of	OO
the	OO
brain	OO
at	OO
once:	OO
the	OO
motor	,O
visual	OO
and	OO
auditory	OO
cortices	.O
if	OU
we	OO
think	OO
about	OO
it	,O
it's	OO
like	OO
a	OO
full	OO
brain	OO
workout;	OO
it's	OO
like	OO
our	OO
legs,our	OO
arms	OO
and	OO
our	OO
torso	OO
doing	OO
an	OO
exercise	OO
at	OO
the	OO
same	OO
time	.O
music	OU
education	OO
is	OO
exercise	OO
for	OO
the	OO
brain	.O
and	OU
among	OO
many	,O
many	OO
other	OO
things	,O
they	OO
also	OO
found	OO
that	OO
musicians	OO
had	OO
a	OO
larger	OO
bridge	,O
a	OO
larger	OO
corpus	OO
callosum	,O
across	OO
the	OO
two	OO
hemispheres	OO
of	OO
the	OO
brain	,O
which	OO
allowed	OO
the	OO
messages	OO
to	OO
travel	OO
far	OO
more	OO
quickly	OO
and	OO
in	OO
very	,O
very	OO
creative	OO
pathways	.O
so	OU
what	OO
did	OO
this	OO
brain	OO
exercise	OO
mean	OO
for	OO
how	OO
musicians'	OO
brains	OO
actually	OO
functioned	?O
again	,U
among	OO
many	,O
many	OO
other	OO
things	OO
they	OO
found	,O
they	OO
found	OO
that	OO
musicians	OO
were	OO
able	OO
to	OO
solve	OO
puzzles	OO
and	OO
problems	OO
far	OO
more	OO
effectively	OO
and	OO
creatively	.O
they	OU
found	OO
that	OO
musicians	OO
had	OO
higher	OO
levels	OO
of	OO
executive	OO
function	.O
now	,U
executive	OO
function	OO
is	OO
a	OO
complex	OO
group	OO
of	OO
activities	OO
in	OO
our	OO
brain	OO
that	OO
solve	OO
those	OO
really	OO
complex	OO
problems	OO
that	OO
have	OO
logical	,O
strategic	,O
conceptual	,O
emotional	OO
elements	OO
to	OO
them	.O
they	OU
also	OO
found	OO
that	OO
musicians	OO
had	OO
very	OO
highly	OO
developed	OO
memory	OO
systems	OO
in	OO
their	OO
brain	.O
and	OU
that	OO
they	OO
thought	OO
this	OO
might	OO
have	OO
happened	OO
because	OO
when	OO
a	OO
musician	OO
makes	OO
a	OO
memory	,O
they	OO
actually	OO
put	OO
tags	OO
against	OO
it	OO
an	OO
emotional	OO

a	OO
visual	OO
tag	,O
a	OO
conceptual	OO
tag	,O
a	OO
contextual	OO
tag	.O
and	OU
overall	,O
so	OO
far	OO
with	OO
these	OO
two	OO
decades	OO
of	OO
research	OO
that	OO
we	OO
now	OO
have	,O
they	OO
have	OO
found	OO
that	OO
music	OO
education	OO
raises	OO
the	OO
general	OO
cognitive	OO
capacity	OO
of	OO
anyone	OO
who	OO
undertakes	OO
it	.O
and	OU
even	OO
further	OO
to	OO
that	,O
they've	OO
found	OO
that	OO
music	OO
education	OO
helps	OO
us	OO
be	OO
comfortable	OO
with	OO
discomfort	.O
now	,U
learning	OO
is	OO
uncomfortable:	OO
we're	OO
asking	OO
our	OO
brains	OO
and	OO
our	OO
bodies	OO
to	OO
do	OO
things	OO
we've	OO
never	OO
done	OO
before	.O
so	OU
music	OO
education	OO
actually	OO
helps	OO
us	OO
be	OO
comfortable	OO
in	OO
that	OO
state	.O
it	OU
helps	OO
us	OO
to	OO
feel	OO
comfortable	OO
with	OO
learning	.O
now	,U
i'd	OU
like	OO
to	OO
share	OO
with	OO
you	OO
two	OO
studies	OO
which	,O
to	OO
me	,O
highlight	OO
some	OO
of	OO
the	OO
many	OO
applications	OO
and	OO
impacts	OO
that	OO
music	OO
education	OO
could	OO
have	.O
first	OU
one	OO
involves	OO
babies	.O
i've	OU
seen	OO
very	OO
trusting	OO
mothers	OO
allow	OO
their	OO
beautiful	OO
babies	OO
to	OO
be	OO
put	OO
into	OO
fmri	OO
machines	OO
so	OO
the	OO
neuroscientists	OO
could	OO
monitor	OO
their	OO
brain	OO
functions	OO
as	OO
the	OO
mothers	OO
spoke	OO
to	OO
them	,O
along	OO
with	OO
many	OO
other	OO
tasks	.O
now	,U
i	OU
say	OO
trusting	OO
mothers	OO
because	OO
these	OO
babies	OO
were	OO
between	OO
one	OO
and	OO
three	OO
days	OO
old	.O
what	OU
the	OO
neuroscientists	OO
saw	OO
is	OO
that	OO
the	OO
babies	OO
were	OO
using	OO
their	OO
music	OO
processing	OO
networks	OO
to	OO
understand	OO
their	OO
mother's	OO
voices	.O
literally	,U
they	OO
were	OO
hearing	OO
music	OO
in	OO
their	OO
mother's	OO
voices	.O
and	OU
this	OO
confirms	OO
something	OO
that	OO
the	OO
neuroscientists	OO
had	OO
been	OO
thinking	OO
for	OO
a	OO
while	,O
that	OO
music	OO
and	OO
language	OO
processing	OO
are	OO
very	OO
closely	OO
connected	OO
in	OO
the	OO
brain	,O
that	,O
indeed	,O
at	OO
birth	OO
we	OO
need	OO
our	OO
music	OO
processing	OO
to	OO
understand	OO
our	OO
language:	OO
at	OO
birth	,O
we	OO
are	OO
musical	.O
the	OU
second	OO
study	OO
involves	OO
iq	OU
points	.O
and	OU
i	OU
know	OO
we	OO
could	OO
have	OO
a	OO
whole	OO
other	OO
ted	OU
talk	OU
about	OO
iq	OU
points	,O
but	OO
they	OO
are	OO
a	OO
well	OO
used	OO
measure	OO
of	OO
intellectual	OO
capacity	.O
and	OU
in	OO
this	OO
study	OO
comparing	OO
musicians	OO
with	OO
non	OO
musicians	,O
they	OO
found	OO
that	OO
those	OO
that	OO
had	OO
undertaken	OO
music	OO
education	OO
before	OO
the	OO
age	OO
of	OO
seven	OO
had	OO
around	OO
about	OO
7.5	OO
iq	OU
points	OO
higher	OO
than	OO
those	OO
that	OO
had	OO
not	.O
now	,U
7.5	OO
iq	OU
points	OO
doesn't	OO
sound	OO
like	OO
much	,O
but	OO
if	OO
we	OO
put	OO
it	OO
in	OO
context	,O
an	OO
iq	OU
of	OO
100	OO
is	OO
said	OO
to	OO
be	OO
average	OO
or	OO
normal	,O
an	OO
iq	OU
of	OO
130	OO
is	OO
said	OO
to	OO
be	OO
genius	OO
or	OO
entry	OO
into	OO
mensa	.U
so	OU
7.5	OO
points	OO
is	OO
huge	.O
it's	OU
over	OO
20%	.O
and	OU
even	OO
further	OO
to	OO
that	,O
another	OO
study	OO
looked	OO
at	OO
the	OO
economic	OO
capacity	OO
vs	.O
iq	OU
point	,O
how	OO
much	OO
more	OO
we	OO
would	OO
earn	OO
per	OO
year	,O
on	OO
average	,O
per	OO
one	OO
iq	OU
point	OO
that	OO
we	OO
had	OO
higher	.O
what	OU
they	OO
found	OO
in	OO
today's	OO
dollars	OO
is	OO
that	OO
for	OO
every	OO
iq	OU
point	OO
higher	OO
we	OO
have	OO
is	OO
equal	OO
to	OO
about	OO
$700	OO
per	OO
year	.O
let's	OU
take	OO
our	OO
7.5	OO
iq	OU
points	OO
for	OO
music	OO
education	.O
that's	OU
about	OO
$5000	OO
per	OO
year	.O
now	OU
think	OO
of	OO
that	OO
across	OO
10	OO
years	,O
and	OO
suddenly	OO
we	OO
start	OO
to	OO
see	OO
that	OO
music	OO
education	OO
could	OO
have	OO
an	OO
enormous	OO
impact	OO
on	OO
every	OO
part	OO
of	OO
our	OO
society	.O
now	,U
in	OO
every	OO
area	OO
of	OO
scientific	OO
study	,O
it	OO
is	OO
incredibly	OO
important	OO
to	OO
ask	OO
big	OO
questions	OO
and	OO
to	OO
look	OO
at	OO
the	OO
myths	OO
that	OO

in	OO

there	OO
are	OO
two	OO

they	OO
are	OO
that	OO
to	OO

we	OO

to	OO

and	OO
to	OO
play	OO
music	OO
we	OO
need	OO
to	OO
be	OO

neuroscientists	OU
have	OO
now	OO
done	OO
a	OO
large	OO
number	OO
of	OO

that	OO

showed	OO
that	OO

you	OU
don't	OO

and	OU
if	OO
we	OO

back	OO
to	OO
that	OO

about	OO

we're	OO
all	OO
born	OO
musical	.O
we	OU
have	OO
to	OO
be	OO
to	OO

it	OU
is	OO
the	OO

the	OO

that	OO
we	OO
have	OO
in	OO

that	OO
realizes	OO
that	OO
talent	.O
and	OU
this	OO
gets	OO
me	OO
thinking	OO
even	OO
more	OO
about	OO
the	OO
fact	OO
that	OO
music	OO
education	OO
could	OO
be	OO
the	OO
glue	OO
that	OO

so	OO
many	OO

that	OO
we	OO

with	OO
in	OO
our	OO

our	OO

today	.O
let	OU
me	OO
give	OO
you	OO
some	OO
examples	.O
learning	OU
disorders	.O
at	OU
the	OO
moment	,O
many	OO
of	OO

to	OO

a	OO
miscommunication	OO
between	OO

of	OO
the	OO

and	OU
as	OO
we	OO

actually	OO
makes	OO
those	OO
two	OO
sides	OO

work	OO
together	OO
really	OO
well	.O
adhd	,U
again	,O
at	OO
the	OO

to	OO

a	OO
mistiming	OO
between	OO
the	OO

and	OU
again	,O
we	OO

the	OO
three	OO
areas	OO

incredibly	OO
well	.O
if	OU
we	OO
take	OO
it	OO
another	OO
step	OO
further	,O
music	OO
education	OO
has	OO
been	OO

to	OO

music	OO

the	OO

that	OO
we've	OO

there	OU
is	OO
no	OO
single	OO
answer	.O
but	OU
i	OU
know	OO
it	OO
was	OO
the	OO
answer	OO
for	OO
me	.O
when	OU
i	OU
was	OO
seven	OO
or	OO
eight	OO

i	OU
was	OO
struggling	OO
to	OO

i	OU
could	OO
not	OO
untangle	OO
words	OO

and	OU
it	OO
wasn't	OO
through	OO
a	OO
lack	OO
of	OO

my	OU
mother	OO
was	OO
a	OO
specialist	OO
reading	OO

and	OU
at	OO
the	OO
age	OO
of	OO
nine	,O
someone	OO

me	OO
a	OO
clarinet	OO
by	OO
mistake	OO
i	OU
was	OO
meant	OO
to	OO
get	OO
a	OO

there	OU

none	OO

so	OO
they	OO
said	,O
here	OU
you	OO
go	.O
have	OU
a	OO
clarinet	.O
and	OU
i	OU
learnt	OO
how	OO
to	OO

and	OO
i	OU
learnt	OO
how	OO
to	OO
read	OO
music	.O
within	OU
about	OO
six	OO

i'd	OU
untangled	OO
those	OO

and	OO
those	OO

i	OU
have	OO
no	OO
proof	OO
that	OO
those	OO

are	OO

from	OO
all	OO
the	OO

that	OO
i	OU

from	OO
the	OO

now	,O
with	OO
all	OO
of	OO
this	OO
research	OO
and	OO
all	OO
of	OO
this	OO
knowledge	,O
what	OO
can	OO
we	OO
do	?O
i	OU
think	OO
the	OO
first	OO
thing	OO
we	OO
can	OO
do	OO
is	OO
think	OO
differently	.O
music	OU
is	OO
a	OO
beautiful	OO
and	OO
wonderful	OO
art	OO
form	OO
that	OO
almost	OO
every	OO

on	OO
the	OO

enjoys	OO
in	OO
so	OO
many	OO
different	OO
ways	OO
every	OO
single	OO
day	.O
but	OU
maybe	OO
we	OO
are	OO
missing	OO
an	OO
opportunity	OO
with	OO
music	OO

that	OO

our	OO

in	OO
ways	OO
we	OO

this	,O
where	OO
all	OO

you	OO

me	.O
it's	OU
a	OO
powerful	OO
feeling	,O
to	OO

i'm	OU
an	OO
actor	,O
so	OO
i'm	OU
a	OO
bit	OO
of	OO
an	OO
expert	OO
on	,O
well	,O
nothing	,O
really	.O
but	OU
i	OU
do	OO
know	OO
what	OO
it	OO
feels	OO
like	OO
to	OO
get	OO
attention	OO
—	OO
i've	OU
been	OO
lucky	OO
in	OO
my	OO
life	OO
to	OO
get	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
more	OO
than	OO
my	OO
fair	OO
share	OO
of	OO
attention	.O
and	OU
i'm	OU
grateful	OO
for	OO
that	,O
because	OO
like	OO
i	OU
said	,O
it's	OO
a	OO
powerful	OO
feeling	.O
but	OU
there's	OO
another	OO
powerful	OO
feeling	OO
that	OO
i've	OU
also	OO
been	OO
lucky	OO
to	OO
experience	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
as	OO
an	OO
actor	.O
and	OU
it's	OO
funny	,O
it's	OO
sort	OO
of	OO
the	OO
opposite	OO
feeling	,O
because	OO
it	OO
doesn't	OO
come	OO
from	OO
getting	OO
attention	.O
it	OU
comes	OO
from	OO
paying	OO
attention	.O
when	OU
i'm	OU
acting	,O
i	OU
get	OO
so	OO
focused	OO
that	OO
i'm	OU
only	OO
paying	OO
attention	OO
to	OO
one	OO
thing	.O
like	OU
when	OO
i'm	OU
on	OO
set	OO
and	OO
we're	OO
about	OO
to	OO
shoot	OO
and	OO
the	OO
first	OO
ad	OU
calls	OO
out	OO
rolling	.U
and	OU
then	OO
i	OU
hear	OO
speed	,O
marker	,O
set	,O
and	OO
then	OO
the	OO
director	OO
calls	OO
action	.U
i've	OU
heard	OO
that	OO
sequence	OO
so	OO
many	OO
times	,O
like	,O
it's	OO
become	OO
this	OO
pavlovian	OU
magic	OO
spell	OO
for	OO
me	.O
rolling	,U
speed	,O
marker	,O
set	OO
and	OO
action	.O
something	OU
happens	OO
to	OO
me	,O
i	OU
can't	OO
even	OO
help	OO
it	.O
my	OU
attention	.O
narrows	.O
and	OU
everything	OO
else	OO
in	OO
the	OO
world	,O
anything	OO
else	OO
that	OO
might	OO
be	OO
bothering	OO
me	OO
or	OO
might	OO
grab	OO
my	OO
attention	,O
it	OO
all	OO
goes	OO
away	,O
and	OO
i'm	OU
just	.O
there	.O
and	OU
that	OO
feeling	,O
that	OO
is	OO
what	OO
i	OU
love	,O
that	,O
to	OO
me	,O
is	OO
creativity	.O
and	OU
that's	OO
the	OO
biggest	OO
reason	OO
i'm	OU
so	OO
grateful	OO
that	OO
i	OU
get	OO
to	OO
be	OO
an	OO
actor	.O
so	,U
there's	OO
these	OO
two	OO
powerful	OO
feelings	.O
there's	OU
getting	OO
attention	OO
and	OO
paying	OO
attention	.O
of	OU
course	,O
in	OO
the	OO
last	OO
decade	OO
or	OO
so	,O
new	OO
technology	OO
has	OO
allowed	OO
more	OO
and	OO
more	OO
people	OO
to	OO
have	OO
this	OO
powerful	OO
feeling	OO
of	OO
getting	OO
attention	.O
for	OU
any	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
creative	OO
expression	,O
not	OO
just	OO
acting	.O
it	OU
could	OO
be	OO
writing	OO
or	OO
photography	OO
or	OO
drawing	,O
music	OO
—	OO
everything	.O
the	OU
channels	OO
of	OO
distribution	OO
have	OO
been	OO
democratized	,O
and	OO
that's	OO
a	OO
good	OO
thing	.O
but	OU
i	OU
do	OO
think	OO
there's	OO
an	OO
unintended	OO
consequence	OO
for	OO
anybody	OO
on	OO
the	OO
planet	OO
with	OO
an	OO
urge	OO
to	OO
be	OO
creative	OO
—	OO
myself	OO
included	,O
because	OO
i'm	OU
not	OO
immune	OO
to	OO
this	.O
i	OU
think	OO
that	OO
our	OO
creativity	OO
is	OO
becoming	OO
more	OO
and	OO
more	OO
of	OO
a	OO
means	OO
to	OO
an	OO
end	OO
—	OO
and	OO
that	OO
end	OO
is	OO
to	OO
get	OO
attention	.O
and	OU
so	OO
i	OU
feel	OO
compelled	OO
to	OO
speak	OO
up	OO
because	OO
in	OO
my	OO
experience	,O
the	OO
more	OO
i	OU
go	OO
after	OO
that	OO
powerful	OO
feeling	OO
of	OO
paying	OO
attention	,O
the	OO
happier	OO
i	OU
am	.O
but	OU
the	OO
more	OO
i	OU
go	OO
after	OO
the	OO
powerful	OO
feeling	OO
of	OO
getting	OO
attention	,O
the	OO
unhappier	OO
i	OU
am	.O
and	OU
—	OO
thanks	.O
so	OU
this	OO
is	OO
something	OO
that	OO
goes	OO
way	OO
back	OO
for	OO
me	.O
i	OU
think	OO
the	OO
first	OO
time	OO
i	OU
can	OO
remember	OO
using	OO
my	OO
acting	OO
to	OO
get	OO
attention	,O
i	OU
was	OO
eight	OO
years	OO
old	OO
at	OO
summer	OO
camp	.O
and	OU
i'd	OU
been	OO
going	OO
on	OO
auditions	OO
for	OO
about	OO
a	OO
year	OO
by	OO
then	,O
and	OO
i'd	OU
been	OO
lucky	OO
to	OO
get	OO
some	OO
small	OO
parts	OO
in	OO
tv	OU
shows	OO
and	OO
commercials	,O
and	OO
i	OU
bragged	OO
about	OO
it	OO
a	OO
lot	,O
that	OO
summer	OO
at	OO
camp	.O
and	OU
at	OO
first	,O
it	OO
worked	.O
the	OU
other	OO
kids	OO
gave	OO
me	OO
a	OO
bunch	OO
of	OO
extra	OO
attention	,O
because	OO
i	OU
had	OO
been	OO
on	OO
family	OU
ties	.U
that's	OU
a	OO
picture	OO
of	OO
me	OO
on	OO
family	OU
ties	.U
then	,U
the	OO
tide	OO
turned	OO
—	OO
i	OU
think	OO
i	OU
took	OO
it	OO
too	OO
far	OO
with	OO
the	OO
bragging	.O
and	OU
then	,O
the	OO
other	OO
kids	OO
started	OO
to	OO
make	OO
fun	OO
of	OO
me	.O
i	OU
remember	OO
there	OO
was	OO
this	OO
one	OO
girl	OO
i	OU
had	OO
a	OO
crush	OO
on	,O
rocky	.U
her	OU
name	OO
was	OO
rachel	,U
she	OO
went	OO
by	OO
rocky	.U
and	OU
she	OO
was	OO
beautiful	,O
and	OO
she	OO
could	OO
sing	,O
and	OO
i	OU
was	OO
smitten	OO
with	OO
her	,O
and	OO
i	OU
was	OO
standing	OO
there	,O
bragging	.O
and	OU
she	OO
turned	OO
to	OO
me	OO
and	OO
she	OO
called	OO
me	OO
a	OO
show	OO
off	.O
which	OU
i	OU
100	OO
percent	OO
deserved	.O
but	OU
you	OO
know	,O
it	OO
still	OO
really	OO
hurt	.O
and	OU
ever	OO
since	OO
that	OO
summer	,O
i've	OU
had	OO
a	OO
certain	OO
hesitance	OO
to	OO
seek	OO
attention	OO
for	OO
my	OO
acting	.O
sometimes	,U
people	OO
would	OO
ask	OO
me	,O
wait	OU
a	OO
minute	,O
if	OO
you	OO
don't	OO
like	OO
the	OO
attention	,O
then	OO
why	OO
are	OO
you	OO
an	OO
actor	?O
and	OU
i'd	OU
be	OO
like	,O
because	OU
that's	OO
not	OO
what	OO
acting's	OO
about	,O
man	,O
it's	OO
about	OO
the	OO
art	.O
and	OU
they'd	OO
be	OO
like	,O
ok	,U
ok	,U
dude	.O
and	OU
then	OO
twitter	OU
came	OO
out	.O
and	OU
i	OU
got	OO
totally	OO
hooked	OO
on	OO
it	,O
just	OO
like	OO
everybody	OO
else	,O
which	OO
made	OO
me	OO
into	OO
a	OO
complete	OO
hypocrite	.O
because	OU
at	OO
that	OO
point	,O
i	OU
was	OO
absolutely	OO
using	OO
my	OO
acting	OO
to	OO
get	OO
attention	.O
i	OU
mean	,O
what	,O
did	OO
i	OU
think	OO
i	OU
was	OO
just	OO
getting	OO
all	OO
these	OO
followers	OO
because	OO
of	OO
my	OO
brilliant	OO
tweets	?O
i	OU
actually	OO
did	OO
think	OO
that	OO
—	OO
i	OU
was	OO
like	OO
—	OO
they	OU
don't	OO
just	OO
like	OO
me	OO
because	OO
they	OO
saw	OO
me	OO
in	OO
'batman,'	OO
they	OO
like	OO
what	OO
i	OU
have	OO
to	OO
say	,O
i've	OU
got	OO
a	OO
way	OO
with	OO
words	.O
and	OU
then	OO
in	OO
no	OO
time	OO
at	OO
all	,O
it	OO
started	OO
having	OO
an	OO
impact	OO
on	OO
my	OO
dearly	OO
beloved	OO
creative	OO
process	.O
it	OU
still	OO
does	.O
i	OU
try	OO
not	OO
to	OO
let	OO
it	.O
but	OU
you	OO
know	,O
i'd	OU
be	OO
sitting	OO
there	,O
like	,O
reading	OO
a	OO
script	.O
and	OU
instead	OO
of	OO
thinking	,O
how	OU
can	OO
i	OU
personally	OO
identify	OO
with	OO
this	OO

or	OU
how	OU

the	OO

story	?O
i'm	OU
like	,O
what	OU
are	OO
people	OO
going	OO
to	OO
say	OO
about	OO
this	OO
movie	OO
on	OO
twitter	?U
and	OU
what	OU
will	OO
i	OU
say	OO
back	OO
that	OO
will	OO
be	OO
good	OO
and	OO
snarky	OO
enough	OO
to	OO
get	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
retweets	,O
but	OO
not	OO
too	OO
harsh	,O
because	OO
people	OO
love	OO
to	OO
get	OO
offended	,O
and	OO
i	OU
don't	OO
want	OO
to	OO
get	OO
canceled	?O
these	OU
are	OO
the	OO
thoughts	OO
that	OO
enter	OO
my	OO
mind	OO
when	OO
i'm	OU
supposed	OO
to	OO
be	OO
reading	OO
a	OO
script	,O
trying	OO
to	OO
be	OO
an	OO
artist	.O
and	OU
i'm	OU
not	OO
here	OO
to	OO
tell	OO
you	OO
that	OO
technology	OO
is	OO
the	OO
enemy	OO
of	OO
creativity	.O
i	OU
don't	OO
think	OO
that	.O
i	OU
think	OO
tech	OO
is	OO
just	OO
a	OO
tool	.O
it	OU
has	OO
the	OO
potential	OO
to	OO
foster	OO
unprecedented	OO
human	OO
creativity	.O
like	,U
i	OU
even	OO
started	OO
an	OO
online	OO
community	OO
called	OO
hitrecord	,U
where	OO
people	OO
all	OO
over	OO
the	OO
world	OO
collaborate	OO
on	OO
all	OO
kinds	OO
of	OO
creative	OO
projects	,O
so	OO
i	OU
don't	OO
think	OO
that	OO
social	OO
media	OO
or	OO
smartphones	OO
or	OO
any	OO
technology	OO
is	OO
problematic	OO
in	OO
and	OO
of	OO
itself	.O
but	.U
if	OO
we're	OO
going	OO
to	OO
talk	OO
about	OO
the	OO
perils	OO
of	OO
creativity	OO
becoming	OO
a	OO
means	OO
to	OO
get	OO
attention	,O
then	OO
we	OO
have	OO
to	OO
talk	OO
about	OO
the	OO
attention	OO
driven	OO
business	OO
model	OO
of	OO
today's	OO
big	OO
social	OO
media	OO
companies	,O
right	?O
this	OU
will	OO
be	OO
familiar	OO
territory	OO
for	OO
some	OO
of	OO
you	,O
but	OO
it's	OO
a	OO
really	OO
relevant	OO
question	OO
here:	OO
how	OU
does	OO
a	OO
social	OO
media	OO
platform	OO
like	,O
for	OO
example	,O
instagram	,U
make	OO
money	?O
it's	OU
not	OO
selling	OO
a	OO
photo	OO
sharing	OO
service	OO
—	OO
that	OO
part's	OO
free	.O
so	OU
what	OO
is	OO
it	OO
selling	?O
it's	OU
selling	OO
attention	.O
it's	OU
selling	OO
the	OO
attention	OO
of	OO
its	OO
users	OO
to	OO
advertisers	.O
and	OU
there's	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
discussion	OO
right	OO
now	OO
about	OO
how	OO
much	OO
attention	OO
we're	OO
all	OO
giving	OO
to	OO
things	OO
like	OO
instagram	,U
but	OO
my	OO
question	OO
is:	OO
how	OU
is	OO
instagram	OU
getting	OO
so	OO
much	OO
attention	?O
we	OU
get	OO
it	OO
for	OO
them	.O
anytime	OU
somebody	OO
posts	OO
on	OO
instagram	,U
they	OO
get	OO
a	OO
certain	OO
amount	OO
of	OO
attention	OO
from	OO
their	OO
followers	,O
whether	OO
they	OO
have	OO
a	OO
few	OO
followers	OO
or	OO
a	OO
few	OO
million	OO
followers	.O
and	OU
the	OO
more	OO
attention	OO
you're	OO
able	OO
to	OO
get	,O
the	OO
more	OO
attention	OO
instagram	OU
is	OO
able	OO
to	OO
sell	.O
so	OU
it's	OO
in	OO
instagram's	OU
interest	OO
for	OO
you	OO
to	OO
get	OO
as	OO
much	OO
attention	OO
as	OO
possible	.O
and	OU
so	OO
it	OO
trains	OO
you	OO
to	OO
want	OO
that	OO
attention	,O
to	OO
crave	OO
it	,O
to	OO
feel	OO
stressed	OO
out	OO
when	OO
you're	OO
not	OO
getting	OO
enough	OO
of	OO
it	.O
instagram	OU
gets	OO
its	OO
users	OO
addicted	OO
to	OO
the	OO
powerful	OO
feeling	OO
of	OO
getting	OO
attention	.O
and	OU
i	OU
know	OO
we	OO
all	OO
joke	,O
like	,O
oh	OU
my	OO
god	,U
i'm	OU
so	OO
addicted	OO
to	OO
my	OO
phone	,O
but	OO
this	OO
is	OO
a	OO
real	OO
addiction	.O
there's	OU
a	OO
whole	OO
science	OO
to	OO
it	.O
if	OU
you're	OO
curious	,O
i	OU
recommend	OO
the	OO
work	OO
of	OO
jaron	OU
lanier	,U
tristan	OU
harris	,U
nir	OU
eyal	.U
but	OU
here's	OO
what	OO
i	OU
can	OO
tell	OO
you	.O
being	OU
addicted	OO
to	OO
getting	OO
attention	OO
is	OO
just	OO
like	OO
being	OO
addicted	OO
to	OO
anything	OO
else	.O
it's	OU
never	OO
enough	.O
you	OU
start	OO
out	OO
and	OO
you're	OO
thinking	,O
if	OU
only	OO
i	OU
had	OO
1,000	OO
followers	,O
that	OO
would	OO
feel	OO
amazing	.O
but	OU
then	OO
you're	OO
like	,O
well	,U
once	OO
i	OU
get	OO
to	OO
10,000	OO
followers	,O
and	,O
once	OU
i	OU
get	OO
to	OO
100	OO
—	OO
once	OU
i	OU
get	OO
to	OO
a	OO
million	OO
followers	,O
then	OO
i'll	OU
feel	OO
amazing	.O
so	OU
i	OU
have	OO
4.2	OO
million	OO
followers	OO
on	OO
twitter	OU
—	OO
it's	OO
never	OO
made	OO
me	OO
feel	OO
amazing	.O
i'm	OU
not	OO
going	OO
to	OO
tell	OO
you	OO
how	OO
many	OO
i	OU
have	OO
on	OO
instagram	,U
because	OO
i	OU
feel	OO
genuine	OO
shame	OO
about	OO
how	OO
low	OO
the	OO
number	OO
is	,O
because	OO
i	OU
joined	OO
instagram	OU
after	OO
batman	OU
came	OO
out	.O
and	OU
i	OU
search	OO
other	OO
actors	,O
and	OO
i	OU
see	OO
that	OO
their	OO
number	OO
is	OO
higher	OO
than	OO
mine	,O
and	OO
it	OO
makes	OO
me	OO
feel	OO
terrible	OO
about	OO
myself	.O
because	OU
the	OO
follower	OO
count	OO
makes	OO
everybody	OO
feel	OO
terrible	OO
about	OO
themselves	.O
that	OU
feeling	OO
of	OO
inadequacy	OO
is	OO
what	OO
drives	OO
you	OO
to	OO
post	,O
so	OO
you	OO
can	OO
get	OO
more	OO
attention	,O
and	OO
then	OO
that	OO
attention	OO
that	OO
you	OO
get	OO
is	OO
what	OO
these	OO
companies	OO
sell	,O
that's	OO
how	OO
they	OO
make	OO
their	OO
money	.O
so	OU
there	OO
is	OO
no	OO
amount	OO
of	OO
attention	OO
you	OO
can	OO
get	OO
where	OO
you	OO
feel	OO
like	OO
you've	OO
arrived	,O
and	OO
you're	OO
like	,O
ah	,U
i'm	OU
good	OO
now	.O
and	OU
of	OO
course	,O
there	OO
are	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
of	OO
actors	OO
who	OO
are	OO
more	OO
famous	OO
than	OO
i	OU
am	,O
have	OO
more	OO
followers	OO
than	OO
i	OU
do	,O
but	OO
i	OU
bet	OO
you	OO
they	OO
would	OO
tell	OO
you	OO
the	OO
same	OO
thing	.O
if	OU
your	OO
creativity	OO
is	OO
driven	OO
by	OO
a	OO
desire	OO
to	OO
get	OO
attention	,O
you're	OO
never	OO
going	OO
to	OO
be	OO
creatively	OO
fulfilled	.O
but	OU
i	OU
do	OO
have	OO
some	OO
good	OO
news	.O
there	OU
is	OO
this	OO
other	OO
powerful	OO
feeling	.O
something	OU
else	OO
you	OO
can	OO
do	OO
with	OO
your	OO
attention	OO
besides	OO
letting	OO
a	OO
giant	OO
tech	OO
company	OO
control	OO
it	OO
and	OO
sell	OO
it	.O
this	OU
is	OO
that	OO
feeling	OO
i	OU
was	OO
talking	OO
about	,O
why	OO
i	OU
love	OO
acting	OO
so	OO
much	OO
—	OO
it's	OO
being	OO
able	OO
to	OO
pay	OO
attention	OO
to	OO
just	OO
one	OO
thing	.O
turns	OU
out	OO
there's	OO
actually	OO
some	OO
science	OO
behind	OO
this	OO
too	.O
psychologists	OU
and	OO
neuroscientists	OO
—	OO
they	OO
study	OO
a	OO
phenomenon	OO
they	OO
call	OO
flow	,O
which	OO
is	OO
this	OO
thing	OO
that	OO
happens	OO
in	OO
the	OO
human	OO
brain	OO
when	OO
someone	OO
pays	OO
attention	OO
to	OO
just	OO
one	OO
thing	,O
like	OO
something	OO
creative	,O
and	OO
manages	OO
not	OO
to	OO
get	OO
distracted	OO
by	OO
anything	OO
else	.O
and	OU
some	OO
say	OO
the	OO
more	OO
regularly	OO
you	OO
do	OO
this	,O
the	OO
happier	OO
you'll	OO
be	.O
now	OU
i'm	OU
not	OO
a	OO
psychologist	OO
or	OO
a	OO
neuroscientist	.O
but	OU
i	OU
can	OO
tell	OO
you	,O
for	OO
me	,O
that	OO
is	OO
very	OO
true	.O
it's	OU
not	OO
always	OO
easy	,O
it's	OO
hard	.O
to	OU
really	OO
pay	OO
attention	OO
like	OO
this	OO
takes	OO
practice	,O
everybody	OO
does	OO
it	OO
their	OO
own	OO
way	.O
but	OU
if	OO
there's	OO
one	OO
thing	OO
i	OU
can	OO
share	OO
that	OO
i	OU
think	OO
helps	OO
me	OO
focus	OO
and	OO
really	OO
pay	OO
attention	,O
it's	OO
this:	OO
i	OU
try	OO
not	OO
to	OO
see	OO
other	OO
creative	OO
people	OO
as	OO
my	OO
competitors	.O
i	OU
try	OO
to	OO
find	OO
collaborators	.O
like	,U
if	OO
i'm	OU
acting	OO
in	OO
a	OO
scene	,O
if	OO
i	OU
start	OO
seeing	OO
the	OO
other	OO
actors	OO
as	OO
my	OO
competitors	,O
and	OO
i'm	OU
like	,O
god	,U
they're	OO
going	OO
to	OO
get	OO
more	OO
attention	OO
than	OO
i	OU
am	,O
people	OO
are	OO
going	OO
to	OO
be	OO
talking	OO
about	OO
their	OO
performance	OO
more	OO
than	OO
mine	OO
—	OO
i've	OU
lost	OO
my	OO
focus	.O
and	OU
i'm	OU
probably	OO
going	OO
to	OO
suck	OO
in	OO
that	OO
scene	.O
but	OU
when	OO
i	OU
see	OO
the	OO
other	OO
actors	OO
as	OO
collaborators	,O
then	OO
it	OO
becomes	OO
almost	OO
easy	OO
to	OO
focus	,O
because	OO
i'm	OU
just	OO
paying	OO
attention	OO
to	OO
them	.O
and	OU
i	OU
don't	OO
have	OO
to	OO
think	OO
about	OO
what	OO
i'm	OU
doing	OO
—	OO
i	OU
react	OO
to	OO
what	OO
they're	OO
doing	,O
they	OO
react	OO
to	OO
what	OO
i'm	OU
doing	,O
and	OO
we	OO
can	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
keep	OO
each	OO
other	OO
in	OO
it	OO
together	.O
but	OU
i	OU
don't	OO
want	OO
you	OO
to	OO
think	OO
it's	OO
only	OO
actors	OO
on	OO
a	OO
set	OO
that	OO
can	OO
collaborate	OO
in	OO
this	OO
way	.O
i	OU
could	OO
be	OO
in	OO
whatever	OO
kind	OO
of	OO
creative	OO
situation	.O
it	OU
could	OO
be	OO
professional	,O
could	OO
be	OO
just	OO
for	OO
fun	.O
i	OU
could	OO
be	OO
collaborating	OO
with	OO
people	OO
i'm	OU
not	OO
even	OO
in	OO
the	OO
same	OO
room	OO
with	.O
in	OU
fact	,O
some	OO
of	OO
my	OO
favorite	OO
things	OO
i've	OU
ever	OO
made	,O
i	OU
made	OO
with	OO
people	OO
that	OO
i	OU
never	OO
physically	OO
met	.O
and	OU
by	OO
the	OO
way	,O
this	,O
to	OO
me	,O
is	OO
the	OO
beauty	OO
of	OO
the	OO
internet	.O
if	OU
we	OO
could	OO
just	OO
stop	OO
competing	OO
for	OO
attention	,O
then	OO
the	OO
internet	OO
becomes	OO
a	OO
great	OO
place	OO
to	OO
find	OO
collaborators	.O
and	OU
once	OO
i'm	OU
collaborating	OO
with	OO
other	OO
people	,O
whether	OO
they're	OO
on	OO
set	,O
or	OO
online	,O
wherever	,O
that	OO
makes	OO
it	OO
so	OO
much	OO
easier	OO
for	OO
me	OO
to	OO
find	OO
that	OO
flow	,O
because	OO
we're	OO
all	OO
just	OO
paying	OO
attention	OO
to	OO
the	OO
one	OO
thing	OO
that	OO
we're	OO
making	OO
together	.O
and	OU
i	OU
fell	OO
like	OO
i'm	OU
part	OO
of	OO
something	OO
larger	OO
than	OO
myself	,O
and	OO
we	OO
all	OO
sort	OO
of	OO
shield	OO
each	OO
other	OO
from	OO
anything	OO
else	OO
that	OO
might	OO
otherwise	OO
grab	OO
our	OO
attention	,O
and	OO
we	OO
can	OO
all	OO
just	OO
be	OO
there	.O
at	OU
least	OO
that's	OO
what	OO
works	OO
for	OO
me	.O
sometimes	.U
sometimes	OU
—	OO
it	OO
doesn't	OO
always	OO
work	.O
sometimes	,U
i	OU
still	OO
totally	OO
get	OO
wrapped	OO
up	OO
in	OO
that	OO
addictive	OO
cycle	OO
of	OO
wanting	OO
to	OO
get	OO
attention	.O
i	OU
mean	,O
like	,O
even	OO
right	OO
now	,O
can	OO
i	OU
honestly	OO
say	OO
there's	OO
not	OO
some	OO
part	OO
of	OO
me	OO
here	OO
who's	OO
like	,O
hey	,U
everybody	,O
look	OO
at	OO
me	,O
i'm	OU
giving	OO
a	OO
ted	OU

there	OU

—	OO
there's	,O
you	OO
know	,O
some	OO
part	.O
but	OU
i	OU
can	OO
also	OO
honestly	OO
say	OO
that	OO
this	OO
whole	OO
creative	OO
process	OO
of	OO
writing	OO
and	OO
giving	OO
this	OO
talk	,O
it's	OO
been	OO
a	OO
huge	OO
opportunity	OO
for	OO
me	OO
to	OO
focus	OO
and	OO
really	OO
pay	OO
attention	OO
to	OO
something	OO
i	OU
care	OO
a	OO

about	.O

her	OO

she	OO

this	OO
superpower	OO
quite	OO
enough	,O
and	OO
that	OO
begs	OO
the	OO
question:	OO
why	OU
not	?O
what's	OU
wrong	OO
is	OO
how	OO
our	OO
communities	,O
businesses	OO
and	OO
institutions	OO
are	OO
designed	.O
they're	OU
designed	OO
in	OO
a	OO
way	OO
that's	OO
impairing	OO
our	OO
foresight	.O
i	OU
want	OO
to	OO
talk	OO
to	OO
you	OO
about	OO
the	OO
three	OO
key	OO
mistakes	OO
that	OO
i	OU
think	OO
we're	OO
making	.O
the	OU
first	OO
mistake	OO
is	OO
what	OO
we	OO
measure	.O
when	OU
we	OO
look	OO
at	OO
the	OO
quarterly	OO
profits	OO
of	OO
a	OO
company	OO
or	OO
its	OO
near	OO
term	OO
stock	OO
price	,O
that's	OO
often	OO
not	OO
a	OO
great	OO
measure	OO
of	OO
whether	OO
that	OO
company	OO
is	OO
going	OO
to	OO
grow	OO
its	OO
market	OO
share	OO
or	OO
be	OO
inventive	OO
in	OO
the	OO
long	OO
run	.O
when	OU
we	OO
glue	OO
ourselves	OO
to	OO
the	OO
test	OO
scores	OO
that	OO
kids	OO
bring	OO
back	OO
from	OO
school	,O
that's	OO
not	OO
necessarily	OO
what's	OO
great	OO
for	OO
those	OO
kids'	OO
learning	OO
and	OO
curiosity	OO
in	OO
the	OO
long	OO
run	.O
we're	OU
not	OO
measuring	OO
what	OO
really	OO
matters	OO
in	OO
the	OO
future	.O
the	OU
second	OO
mistake	OO
we're	OO
making	OO
that	OO
impairs	OO
our	OO
foresight	OO
is	OO
what	OO
we	OO
reward	.O
when	OU
we	OO
celebrate	OO
a	OO
political	OO
leader	OO
or	OO
a	OO
business	OO
leader	OO
for	OO
the	OO
disaster	OO
she	OO
just	OO
cleaned	OO
up	OO
or	OO
the	OO
announcement	OO
she	OO
just	OO
made	,O
we're	OO
not	OO
motivating	OO
that	OO
leader	OO
to	OO
invest	OO
in	OO
preventing	OO
those	OO
disasters	OO
in	OO
the	OO
first	OO
place	,O
or	OO
to	OO
put	OO
down	OO
payments	OO
on	OO
the	OO
future	OO
by	OO
protecting	OO
communities	OO
from	OO
floods	OO
or	OO
fighting	OO
inequality	OO
or	OO
investing	OO
in	OO
research	OO
and	OO
education	.O
the	OU
third	OO
mistake	OO
that	OO
impairs	OO
our	OO
foresight	OO
is	OO
what	OO
we	OO
fail	OO
to	OO
imagine	.O
now	,U
when	OO
we	OO
do	OO
think	OO
about	OO
the	OO
future	,O
we	OO
tend	OO
to	OO
focus	OO
on	OO
predicting	OO
exactly	OO
what's	OO
next	,O
whether	OO
we're	OO
using	OO
horoscopes	OO
or	OO
algorithms	OO
to	OO
do	OO
that	.O
but	OU
we	OO
spend	OO
a	OO
lot	OO
less	OO
time	OO
imagining	OO
all	OO
the	OO
possibilities	OO
the	OO
future	OO
holds	.O
when	OU
the	OO
ebola	OU
outbreak	OO
emerged	OO
in	OO
2014	OO
in	OO
west	OU
africa	,U
public	OO
health	OO
officials	OO
around	OO
the	OO
world	OO
had	OO
early	OO
warning	OO
signs	OO
and	OO
predictive	OO
tools	OO
that	OO
showed	OO
how	OO
that	OO
outbreak	OO
might	OO
spread	,O
but	OO
they	OO
failed	OO
to	OO
fathom	OO
that	OO
it	OO
would	,O
and	OO
they	OO
failed	OO
to	OO
act	OO
in	OO
time	OO
to	OO
intervene	,O
and	OO
the	OO
epidemic	OO
grew	OO
to	OO
kill	OO
more	OO
than	OO
11,000	OO
people	.O
when	OU
people	OO
with	OO
lots	OO
of	OO
resources	OO
and	OO
good	OO
forecasts	OO
don't	OO
prepare	OO
for	OO
deadly	OO
hurricanes	,O
they're	OO
often	OO
failing	OO
to	OO
imagine	OO
how	OO
dangerous	OO
they	OO
can	OO
be	.O
now	,U
none	OO
of	OO
these	OO
mistakes	OO
that	OO
i've	OU
described	,O
as	OO
dismal	OO
as	OO
they	OO
might	OO
sound	,O
are	OO
inevitable	.O
in	OU
fact	,O
they're	OO
all	OO
avoidable	.O
what	OU
we	OO
need	OO
to	OO
make	OO
better	OO
decisions	OO
about	OO
the	OO
future	OO
are	OO
tools	OO
that	OO
can	OO
aid	OO
our	OO
foresight	,O
tools	OO
that	OO
can	OO
help	OO
us	OO
think	OO
ahead	.O
think	OU
of	OO
these	OO
as	OO
something	OO
like	OO
the	OO
telescopes	OO
that	OO
ship	OO
captains	OO
of	OO
yore	OO
used	OO
when	OO
they	OO
scanned	OO
the	OO
horizon	.O
only	OU
instead	OO
of	OO
for	OO
looking	OO
across	OO
distance	OO
and	OO
the	OO
ocean	,O
these	OO
tools	OO
are	OO
for	OO
looking	OO
across	OO
time	OO
to	OO
the	OO
future	.O
i	OU
want	OO
to	OO
share	OO
with	OO
you	OO
a	OO
few	OO
of	OO
the	OO
tools	OO
that	OO
i've	OU
found	OO
in	OO
my	OO
research	OO
that	OO
i	OU
think	OO
can	OO
help	OO
us	OO
with	OO
foresight	.O
the	OU
first	OO
tool	OO
i	OU
want	OO
to	OO
share	OO
with	OO
you	OO
i	OU
think	OO
of	OO
as	OO
making	OO
the	OO
long	OO
game	OO
pay	OO
now	.O
this	OU
is	OO
wes	OU
jackson	,U
a	OO
farmer	OO
i	OU
spent	OO
some	OO
time	OO
with	OO
in	OO
kansas	.U
and	OU
jackson	OU
knows	OO
that	OO
the	OO
way	OO
that	OO
most	OO
crops	OO
are	OO
grown	OO
around	OO
the	OO
world	OO
today	OO
is	OO
stripping	OO
the	OO
earth	OO
of	OO
the	OO
fertile	OO
topsoil	OO
we	OO
need	OO
to	OO
feed	OO
future	OO
generations	.O
he	OU
got	OO
together	OO
with	OO
a	OO
group	OO
of	OO
scientists	,O
and	OO
they	OO
bred	OO
perennial	OO
grain	OO
crops	OO
which	OO
have	OO
deep	OO
roots	OO
that	OO
anchor	OO
the	OO
fertile	OO
topsoil	OO
of	OO
a	OO
farm	,O
preventing	OO
erosion	OO
and	OO
protecting	OO
future	OO
harvests	.O
but	OU
they	OO
also	OO
knew	OO
that	OO
in	OO
order	OO
to	OO
get	OO
farmers	OO
to	OO
grow	OO
these	OO
crops	OO
in	OO
the	OO
short	OO
run	,O
they	OO
needed	OO
to	OO
boost	OO
the	OO
annual	OO
yields	OO
of	OO
the	OO
crops	OO
and	OO
find	OO
companies	OO
willing	OO
to	OO
make	OO
cereal	OO
and	OO
beer	OO
using	OO
the	OO
grains	OO
so	OO
that	OO
farmers	OO
could	OO
reap	OO
profits	OO
today	OO
by	OO
doing	OO
what's	OO
good	OO
for	OO
tomorrow	.O
and	OU
this	OO
is	OO
a	OO
tried	OO
and	OO
true	OO
strategy	.O
in	OU
fact	,O
it	OO
was	OO
used	OO
by	OO
george	OU
washington	OU
carver	OU
in	OO
the	OO
south	OU
of	OO
the	OO
united	OU
states	OU
after	OO
the	OO
civil	OU
war	OU
in	OO
the	OO
early	OO
20th	OO
century	.O
a	OU
lot	OO
of	OO
people	OO
have	OO
probably	OO
heard	OO
of	OO
carver's	OU
300	OO
uses	OO
for	OO
the	OO
peanut	,O
the	OO
products	OO
and	OO
recipes	OO
that	OO
he	OO
came	OO
up	OO
with	OO
that	OO
made	OO
the	OO
peanut	OO
so	OO
popular	.O
but	OU
not	OO
everyone	OO
knows	OO
why	OO
carver	OU
did	OO
that	.O
he	OU
was	OO
trying	OO
to	OO
help	OO
poor	OO
alabama	OU
sharecroppers	OO
whose	OO
cotton	OO
yields	OO
were	OO
declining	,O
and	OO
he	OO
knew	OO
that	OO
planting	OO
peanuts	OO
in	OO
their	OO
fields	OO
would	OO
replenish	OO
those	OO
soils	OO
so	OO
that	OO
their	OO
cotton	OO
yields	OO
would	OO
be	OO
better	OO
a	OO
few	OO
years	OO
later	.O
but	OU
he	OO
also	OO
knew	OO
it	OO
needed	OO
to	OO
be	OO
lucrative	OO
for	OO
them	OO
in	OO
the	OO
short	OO
run	.O
alright	,U
so	OO
let's	OO
talk	OO
about	OO
another	OO
tool	OO
for	OO
foresight	.O
this	OU
one	OO
i	OU
like	OO
to	OO
think	OO
of	OO
as	OO
keeping	OO
the	OO
memory	OO
of	OO
the	OO
past	OO
alive	OO
to	OO
help	OO
us	OO
imagine	OO
the	OO
future	.O
so	OU
i	OU
went	OO
to	OO
fukushima	,U
japan	OU
on	OO
the	OO
sixth	OO
anniversary	OO
of	OO
the	OO
nuclear	OO
reactor	OO
disaster	OO
there	OO
that	OO
followed	OO
the	OO
tohoku	OU
earthquake	OO
and	OO
tsunami	OO
of	OO
2011	.O
when	OU
i	OU
was	OO
there	,O
i	OU
learned	OO
about	OO
the	OO
onagawa	OU
nuclear	OU
power	OU
station	,U
which	OO
was	OO
even	OO
closer	OO
to	OO
the	OO
epicenter	OO
of	OO
that	OO
earthquake	OO
than	OO
the	OO
infamous	OO
fukushima	OU
daiichi	OU
that	OO
we	OO
all	OO
know	OO
about	.O
in	OU
onagawa	,U
people	OO
in	OO
the	OO
city	OO
actually	OO
fled	OO
to	OO
the	OO
nuclear	OO
power	OO
plant	OO
as	OO
a	OO
place	OO
of	OO
refuge	.O
it	OU
was	OO
that	OO
safe	.O
it	OU
was	OO
spared	OO
by	OO
the	OO
tsunamis	.O
it	OU
was	OO
the	OO
foresight	OO
of	OO
just	OO
one	OO
engineer	,O
yanosuke	OU
hirai	,U
that	OO
made	OO
that	OO
happen	.O
in	OU
the	OO
1960s	,O
he	OO
fought	OO
to	OO
build	OO
that	OO
power	OO
plant	OO
farther	OO
back	OO
from	OO
the	OO
coast	OO
at	OO
higher	OO
elevation	OO
and	OO
with	OO
a	OO
higher	OO
sea	OO
wall	.O
he	OU
knew	OO
the	OO
story	OO
of	OO
his	OO
hometown	OO
shrine	,O
which	OO
had	OO
flooded	OO
in	OO
the	OO
year	OO
869	OO
after	OO
a	OO
tsunami	.O
it	OU
was	OO
his	OO
knowledge	OO
of	OO
history	OO
that	OO
allowed	OO
him	OO
to	OO
imagine	OO
what	OO
others	OO
could	OO
not	.O
ok	,U
one	OO
more	OO
tool	OO
of	OO
foresight	.O
this	OU
one	OO
i	OU
think	OO
of	OO
as	OO
creating	OO
shared	OO
heirlooms	.O
these	OU
are	OO
lobster	OO
fishermen	OO
on	OO
the	OO
pacific	OU
coast	OO
of	OO
mexico	,U
and	OO
they're	OO
the	OO
ones	OO
who	OO
taught	OO
me	OO
this	.O
they	OU
have	OO
protected	OO
their	OO
lobster	OO
harvest	OO
there	OO
for	OO
nearly	OO
a	OO
century	,O
and	OO
they've	OO
done	OO
that	OO
by	OO
treating	OO
it	OO
as	OO
a	OO
shared	OO
resource	OO
that	OO
they're	OO
passing	OO
on	OO
to	OO
their	OO
collected	OO
children	OO
and	OO
grandchildren	.O
they	OU
carefully	OO
measure	OO
what	OO
they	OO
catch	OO
so	OO
that	OO
they're	OO
not	OO
taking	OO
the	OO
breeding	OO
lobster	OO
out	OO
of	OO
the	OO
ocean	.O
across	OU
north	OU
america	,U
there	OO
are	OO
more	OO
than	OO
30	OO
fisheries	OO
that	OO
are	OO
doing	OO
something	OO
vaguely	OO
similar	OO
to	OO
this	.O
they're	OU
creating	OO
long	OO
term	OO
stakes	OO
in	OO
the	OO
fisheries	OO
known	OO
as	OO
catch	OO
shares	OO
which	OO
get	OO
fishermen	OO
to	OO
be	OO
motivated	OO
not	OO
just	OO
in	OO
taking	OO
whatever	OO
they	OO
can	OO
from	OO
the	OO
ocean	OO
today	OO
but	OO
in	OO
its	OO
long	OO
term	OO
survival	.O
now	OU
there	OO
are	OO
many	,O
many	OO
more	OO
tools	OO
of	OO
foresight	OO
i	OU
would	OO
love	OO
to	OO
share	OO
with	OO
you	,O
and	OO
they	OO
come	OO
from	OO
all	OO
kinds	OO
of	OO
places:	OO
investment	OO
firms	OO
that	OO
look	OO
beyond	OO

and	OU
we're	OO
going	OO
to	OO

as	OO
many	OO
of	OO
these	OO
tools	OO
as	OO
we	OO
can	OO
if	OO
we	OO

what	OO

what	OO

all	OO
this	OO
is	OO

to	OO
be	OO
easy	,O
as	OO
you	OO

some	OU
of	OO

we	OO

pick	OO
up	OO
in	OO

some	OO
we're	OO

to	OO

some	OO
we	OO

to	OO
do	OO

the	OU

is	OO
worth	OO
this	OO
effort	.O
my	OU

inspiration	OO
to	OO
keep	OO
up	OO
this	OO
effort	OO
is	OO
the	OO
instrument	OO
i	OU
shared	OO
with	OO
you	.O
it's	OU
called	OO
a	OO
dilruba	,O
and	OO
it	OO
was	OO
custom	OO
made	OO
for	OO
my	OO
great	OO
grandfather	.O
he	OU
was	OO
a	OO
well	OO
known	OO
music	OO
and	OO
art	OO
critic	OO
in	OO
india	OU
in	OO
the	OO
early	OO
20th	OO
century	.O
my	OU
great	OO
grandfather	OO
had	OO
the	OO
foresight	OO
to	OO
protect	OO
this	OO
instrument	OO
at	OO
a	OO
time	OO
when	OO
my	OO
great	OO
grandmother	OO
was	OO
pawning	OO
off	OO
all	OO
their	OO
belongings	,O
but	OO
that's	OO
another	OO
story	.O
he	OU
protected	OO
it	OO
by	OO
giving	OO
it	OO
to	OO
the	OO
next	OO
generation	,O
by	OO
giving	OO
it	OO
to	OO
my	OO
grandmother	,O
and	OO
she	OO
gave	OO
it	OO
to	OO
me	.O
when	OU
i	OU
first	OO
heard	OO
the	OO
sound	OO
of	OO
this	OO
instrument	,O
it	OO
haunted	OO
me	.O
it	OU
felt	OO
like	OO
hearing	OO
a	OO
wanderer	OO
in	OO
the	OO
himalayan	OU
fog	.O
it	OU
felt	OO
like	OO
hearing	OO
a	OO
voice	OO
from	OO
the	OO
past	.O
that's	OU
my	OO
friend	OO
simran	OU
singh	OU
playing	OO
the	OO
dilruba	.O
when	OU
i	OU
play	OO
it	,O
it	OO
sounds	OO
like	OO
a	OO
cat's	OO
dying	OO
somewhere	,O
so	OO
you're	OO
welcome	.O
this	OU
instrument	OO
is	OO
in	OO
my	OO
home	OO
today	,O
but	OO
it	OO
doesn't	OO
actually	OO
belong	OO
to	OO
me	.O
it's	OU
my	OO
role	OO
to	OO
shepherd	OO
it	OO
in	OO
time	,O
and	OO
that	OO
feels	OO
more	OO
meaningful	OO
to	OO
me	OO
than	OO
just	OO
owning	OO
it	OO
for	OO
today	.O
this	OU
instrument	OO
positions	OO
me	OO
as	OO
both	OO
a	OO
descendant	OO
and	OO
an	OO
ancestor	.O
it	OU
makes	OO
me	OO
feel	OO
part	OO
of	OO
a	OO
story	OO
bigger	OO
than	OO
my	OO
own	.O
and	OU
this	,O
i	OU
believe	,O
is	OO
the	OO
single	OO
most	OO
powerful	OO
way	OO
we	OO
can	OO
reclaim	OO
foresight:	OO
by	OO
seeing	OO
ourselves	OO
as	OO
the	OO
good	OO
ancestors	OO
we	OO
long	OO
to	OO
be	,O
ancestors	OO
not	OO
just	OO
to	OO
our	OO
own	OO
children	OO
but	OO
to	OO
all	OO
humanity	.O
whatever	OU
your	OO
heirloom	OO
is	,O
however	OO
big	OO
or	OO
small	,O
protect	OO
it	OO
and	OO
know	OO
that	OO
its	OO
music	OO
can	OO
resonate	OO
for	OO
generations	.O
thank	OU
you	.O
every	OU
other	OO
night	OO
in	OO
japan	,U
i	OU
step	OO
out	OO
of	OO
my	OO
apartment	,O
i	OU
climb	OO
up	OO
a	OO
hill	OO
for	OO
15	OO
minutes	,O
and	OO
then	OO
i	OU
head	OO
into	OO
my	OO
local	OO
health	OO
club	,O
where	OO
three	OO
ping	OO
pong	OO
tables	OO
are	OO
set	OO
up	OO
in	OO
a	OO

every	OO

and	OO
then	,O
the	OO
balls	OO
collide	OO
in	OO
midair	OO
and	OO
everybody	OO
says	,O
wow	.U
then	,U
choosing	OO
lots	,O
we	OO
select	OO
partners	OO
and	OO
play	OO
doubles	.O
but	OU
i	OU
honestly	OO
couldn't	OO
tell	OO
you	OO
who's	OO
won	,O
because	OO
we	OO
change	OO

every	OO
five	OO
minutes	.O
and	OU
everybody	OO
is	OO
trying	OO
really	OO
hard	OO
to	OO
win	OO

nobody	OO
is	OO
keeping	OO

and	OU
after	OO
an	OO
hour	OO

so	OO
of	OO

i	OU
can	OO
honestly	OO
tell	OO
you	OO
that	OO

the	OO

victory	.O
in	OU

japan's	OU

what	OU

at	OO

more	OO
what	OO

we	OU
never	OO

at	OO

i	OU
always	OO

that	OO

i	OU
was	OO

that	OO
the	OO

to	OO

but	OU
in	OO
japan	,U
i'm	OU
encouraged	OO
to	OO
believe	OO
that	,O
really	,O
the	OO
point	OO
of	OO
a	OO
game	OO
is	OO
to	OO
make	OO
as	OO
many	OO
people	OO
as	OO
possible	OO
around	OO
you	OO

that	OO
they	OO
are	OO

so	OU
you're	OO
not	OO
careening	OO
up	OO
and	OO
down	OO
as	OO
an	OO
individual	OO
might	,O
but	OO
you're	OO
part	OO
of	OO
a	OO
regular	,O
steady	OO
chorus	.O
the	OU
most	OO

their	OO

a	OO

a	OO

as	OO
a	OO

in	OU
japan	,U
a	OO
game	OO
of	OO

an	OO

of	OO

you're	OU
learning	OO
how	OO
to	OO

with	OO
somebody	,O
rather	OO
than	OO
against	OO
her	.O
and	OU
i'll	OU
confess	,O
at	OO
first	,O
this	OO
seemed	OO
to	OO
me	OO
to	OO
take	OO
all	OO
the	OO
fun	OO
out	OO
of	OO
the	OO

i	OU
couldn't	OO
exult	OO
after	OO
a	OO
tremendous	OO

against	OO

because	OO
six	OO

i	OU
was	OO
falling	OO
behind	OO

i	OU
never	OO

when	OO

from	OO
japan	OU

started	OO
playing	OO

again	OO
with	OO
my	OO

archrival	,O
i	OU
noticed	OO
that	OO

was	OO
really	OO
brokenhearted	.O

after	OO
every	OO
victory	,O
i	OU

there	OO

only	OO
one	OO

that	OO

down	.O
now	,U
if	OO

were	OO

this	OO
would	OO

in	OU
japan	,U

if	OO
the	OO

level	OO
after	OO
four	OO
hours	,O
a	OO
baseball	OO
game	OO
ends	OO
in	OO
a	OO
tie	,O

a	OO

in	OU
a	OO

every	OO

does	OO
need	OO
a	OO

a	OO

the	OO

and	OU
i've	OU
come	OO
to	OO

why	OO
it	OO
is	OO
that	OO
chinese	OU
universities	OO
are	OO
said	OO
to	OO
offer	OO
degrees	OO
in	OO
ping	OO

why	OO

that	OO
